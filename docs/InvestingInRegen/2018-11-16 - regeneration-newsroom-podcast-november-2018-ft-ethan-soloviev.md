## Regeneration Newsroom Podcast November 2018 ft. Ethan Soloviev  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the regeneration newsroom podcast of November 2018. This is a joint venture between  
**[0:00:04-0:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:04):**  the investing in regenerative agriculture podcast and Ethan Soloveyev's monthly regeneration newsroom.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:10):**  We're going to talk about the highlights from this month's regeneration newsroom  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:17):**  and dig in with commentary from both of our perspectives around the world.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:22):**  So welcome, Ethan. I mean, it's great to be piloting this, testing this out and to discuss  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:26):**  your great newsroom this month. What's the main story? What's the main thing that people should  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:31):**  definitely, I mean, they should read everything, but should definitely check out when they open  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:35):**  newsletter or find it on email. I think the most significant thing that's happening this month is  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:42):**  really looking at Australia. Australia has an amazing amount of agriculture happening.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:48):**  And this month there was kind of a trio of stories that showed regenerative agriculture all the way  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:00:54):**  from detailed on the ground case studies up to a very high level, former politician making  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:01):**  statements about how to change the whole nation of Australia through regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:07):**  And now I completely agree. I mean, I read the case studies and the Guardian had a big piece  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:12):**  on it. And then of course the article, or actually as much as a policy paper, sorry,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:17):**  on restore the soil and prosper the nation, which is something we completely agree on.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:20):**  Why is it so significant that a politician is saying that? And have you any idea why  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:26):**  that's happening in Australia? Because I I've been following it a bit, but yeah, you're right.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:31):**  Somehow maybe I'm biased, but I see a lot of Australia popping up in region food and egg.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:35):**  Well, from the perspective of kind of the origins of at least permaculture in Australia, Bill  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:41):**  Mawson would always say Australia was the place where humans did the largest amount of damage  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:46):**  in the least amount of time to the ecosystem. And so he was saying that ecological design  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:53):**  permaculture and by extension, the counter reaction regenerative agriculture. Yeah. It's  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:01:58):**  sort of like a immune response of the natural systems to it. So I think that could be part of  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:04):**  it, that there's just sort of an upswelling plus agar agriculture is huge in Australia.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:09):**  It's one of the largest industries. And so I think there's been a lot going on on the ground  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:14):**  and that's the case we see all over the world. Regenerative agriculture has primarily been,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:19):**  at least until this last year, an upswelling from innovative farmers developing new technologies,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:25):**  new approaches, and really just working things on the ground. What's significant about this  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:30):**  is here we have high level post-government official making large statements about how do  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:36):**  we tackle climate change? How do we tackle degrading soils through regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:42):**  And we see this mirrored a little bit in the United States. There's one quick story on a  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:47):**  congressional candidate who was speaking about regenerative agriculture, but it hasn't nearly  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:52):**  gotten to that level yet in the United States or really, you know, anywhere in North America.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:02:57):**  Are you seeing anything in Europe where regenerative agriculture is kind of getting  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:01):**  into the policy level and being discussed? Not really. I mean, I've seen a policy paper or  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:07):**  more a vision manifesto or paper from the Dutch government on agriculture and they call it more  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:13):**  circular agriculture or something like that, which sounds really nice and very interesting.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:19):**  The policy part of it is definitely not there. So now the question is how do we translate that  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:24):**  into concrete examples? How do you tackle the power of the supermarkets or how do you tackle  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:30):**  the huge rises in soil prices or land prices in the Netherlands that are no longer connected to  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:36):**  actually the current capacity? So there's some talk about it, but I haven't seen a very concrete  
**[0:03:42-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:42):**  set of policy measurements that any government should get behind. But you see a bit of talk,  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:50):**  as you see everywhere around soil, but I haven't seen concrete things, nor here in Italy,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:03:55):**  where soil hasn't been on the agenda, except when it floods away in some of the many floods we had  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:01):**  in the past weeks here, which actually killed over 30 people. So it's soil again is on the news,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:07):**  but not in a way that we would like to see it. But could it be also that Australia is really  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:12):**  suffering from, I'm thinking that probably the thing we read here with Australia in agriculture  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:19):**  is drought. And when there's a 10 year drought or an eight year drought, maybe climate change hits  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:25):**  harder there and thus more of the farmers started looking for alternatives. It's something I'm  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:30):**  wondering. Definitely. Yeah. There's a paper that I'm going to post in this month's newsroom that  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:36):**  actually has some statistics looking at the drought, but also looking at what they call  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:40):**  conservative or conservation agriculture, which is actually quite widespread in Australia. The paper  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:46):**  says that 90% of rain fed agriculture in Australia has adopted some form of conservation agriculture.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:52):**  So I think the pressures of the drought over the last decade have moved farmers in this very,  
**[0:04:57-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:04:57):**  in a way, common sense direction. And so in a lot of ways, a step on from conservation is to head  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:05):**  towards regeneration. I think one thing we have to be careful of when talking about regenerative  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:10):**  agriculture in Australia is that there's really different levels of regenerative agriculture going  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:16):**  on. And honestly, I think a lot of what people are calling regenerative agriculture in Australia is  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:22):**  actually, it's not really regenerative agriculture. It's basically just conservative agriculture  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:28):**  developed a little bit more in the technology and the thinking of it, but it's still, you know,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:33):**  no till cover crops, crop rotation, efficient irrigation, which doesn't really get to the deeper  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:38):**  levels of regenerative agroforestry, animal integration, and a bigger sort of systems change  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:46):**  perspective on what regenerative agriculture can be. So I think one thing I've noticed a lot from  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:51):**  Australia is that maybe there's more people saying they're doing regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:05:56):**  but when we look at it from a global perspective, it may not be as deep as it could be.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:02):**  I think that's honestly the case in many places. People are using it everywhere. And I mean, if you  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:09):**  search or you follow the Google trends, it's popping up. But if you really dig deeper in,  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:14):**  are they building soils in a way that makes sense? And are they really taking on the bigger  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:20):**  challenges of agriculture? Many are not yet. I would have to say, I think it's a great platform  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:25):**  to start and some to continue, but yeah, there may, I mean, there are some examples of them.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:31):**  Well, like people that actually took it to a whole new level and they're there in Australia as well.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:37):**  I mean, I've read the book of Charles Massey. There are some that are really, really pushing  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:41):**  the boundaries, but yeah, if you say X percent or half of it or whatever is already close to  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:47):**  regenerative and probably we're fooling ourselves. Yeah. And I think I'm working on a new paper that  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:53):**  will attempt to help discern between these different levels of our, really these different  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:06:59):**  paradigms of agriculture from the extractive to the conservative to restorative and all the way  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:04):**  to regenerative and really be able to help people distinguish, okay, they're saying it's regenerative,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:09):**  but is it really, how could I tell, how could I self assess my own farming operation to find  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:13):**  that out? So that'll be forthcoming in the next couple of months. It'll be super, super useful.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:18):**  Let's keep moving. Otherwise we'll never get to the end of the newsletter. What else I saw,

**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:29):**  levels you just mentioned, but there's the first product of land to market. We say when it came  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:33):**  out, did you already taste it? Where can we find it? Why is it so exciting? I haven't yet. I'm  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:39):**  really excited to, this is the first product. Uh, it's a spicy beef sriracha bites from  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:46):**  Epic provisions, which is a very exciting startup. It's part of general meals, right? Yeah. Now,  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:52):**  yeah. Purchased by general meals and honestly they're, they're quality and their sourcing  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:07:57):**  dropped off a good bit when they're a purchase, but this is a really important step for them  
**[0:08:01-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:01):**  back into the eyes of hardcore grass fed consumers. They've sourced from a really excellent farm in  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:10):**  the United States and are providing the first land to market verified positive ecological outcomes  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:17):**  in this product. They are only selling it online at this point from their epic provisions website.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:22):**  They're looking for retail partners and I think it'll be very interesting to see which retailer  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:28):**  is the one that picks it up because I think that will send a signal to other retailers  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:33):**  that a regenerative agriculture is coming. And how they're going to communicate it. I'm very  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:38):**  curious about the brand marketing and how, how are you going to sell soil? Basically,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:42):**  that's some funding general music has been experimenting with, I think with ends,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:47):**  what does the Mac and cheese, but it would be great to see more soil in the supermarkets and,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:52):**  uh, in the grocery shops. Absolutely. And I think one thing, so from my day job at how good  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:08:58):**  we rate the sustainability, the regenerative nature of food products and also health and  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:03):**  beauty and cleaning products. And how did they, how did they rate? How would these rate?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:08):**  Actually, we haven't rated this one yet. So we can talk about in the, on the next podcast,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:13):**  we'll see what they ended up getting. But I think what's really interesting is we've been able to  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:17):**  track now through some data partnerships, how the market is responded. So what are the actual sales  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:23):**  that are happening for different products in the marketplace? And so that's the other reason  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:28):**  I wanted to get into retail is that we can track and see, you know, what's the market response.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:32):**  Are people excited about this? Are they willing to, you know, pay the small premium?  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:37):**  If there is one that's going to be on there when it gets to supermarket shelves, this is  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:40):**  very exciting. And I think the next year, as we see more land to market products hit the shelves  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:46):**  and as other certifications start to get online, the regen organic certification  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:51):**  and the other one forthcoming from green America, it'll be very interesting to see if  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:09:55):**  consumers by and large are as excited as all of us regenerative agriculture fanatics are.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah. And if enough people pick it up and eat it, and of course, if it tastes good and if the  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:05):**  ingredients are interesting and good, I mean, there's, there's still a lot to do, but it's,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:08):**  I think it's quite a monumental shift because the first time for the Saver Institute who has  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:14):**  been working on this, I mean, on this specifically, I think for two years, but in general on holistic  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:19):**  management for the last 30 to 40 years, it's a huge step. So I'm very happy we see that in  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:26):**  almost the end of 2018. Yeah. Very exciting. And I think one thing that's really going to  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:31):**  help on the brand marketing and, you know, consumer pickup of this is really the video  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:36):**  and media side of that. Yeah, because you had a few, quite a few media things in the newsroom.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:40):**  Just tell a bit about the videos, the podcast, how we're going to promote market this amazing  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:46):**  regeneration story with all the complexity that is part of that. I think sort of small mini  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:52):**  documentaries are going to be really important and Kiss the Ground is really a leader in this realm.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:10:59):**  They put out an excellent little video called a regenerative secret, uh, that has some really  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:05):**  great drone footage of moving animals between different pastures. It's worth just, just checking  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:11):**  the video just for the drone video. It's already makes it makes you think that. Yeah, but it's really,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:16):**  it's an eight minute video that packs a lot of information and some beautiful visuals. And I  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:21):**  think little things like that are going to get a lot of, a lot of play because they're real.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:25):**  They're showing real farms, real farmers figuring out how to do this much more so than the kind of,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:31):**  I don't know, interesting, but also a little strange video that came out from Patagonia.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:36):**  Did you get a chance to see that? Yeah, I saw it. I have to say it's the coloring, the, the,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:41):**  it was very digitized. It wasn't really my video. I've seen other ones of them. Maybe it's because  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:47):**  I'm so much in the sector, which I really loved on their beef jerky and this almond part. And  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:52):**  they really made these mini documentaries you mentioned before. This is a completely  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:55):**  different one for everyone who wants to watch it. It's very different. It didn't really  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:11:59):**  hit me to be honest. It was a bit weird. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think, you know,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:04):**  I think they're aiming at a particular consumer segment. Um, and it could work for that, but  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:11):**  I don't think any farmer watching that video is going to be inspired to explore regenerative  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:18):**  agriculture, think about how they could develop and evolve their farm systems towards greater  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:24):**  ecological resilience and towards, you know, farm profitability. It didn't, it sort of seemed like  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:28):**  it missed the mark in actually supporting farmers to head into this. Which might not be their goal.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:34):**  I mean, they do have to sell their produce. Yeah. And I think it shows as well. I mean,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:40):**  what do you want to achieve by your media or your content? What do you want to get to? And who's  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:45):**  your audience? And apparently we're not the one with this video. We're not the audience.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:50):**  You know, it's just something I'm thinking of that we haven't seen a lot of, and again,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:53):**  Kiss the Ground is I think the best at this so far. We haven't seen a lot of like regenerative  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:12:59):**  agriculture means little image boards and little funny photos with texts that are sort of getting  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:06):**  people interested and excited. That's I'd love to see some more people do that. Get some little  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:11):**  meme mind magic out there, getting people interested and excited about regenerative  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:16):**  agriculture. So yeah, I would love to see more. I mean, if people have examples of that,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:20):**  definitely hit us in the comments underneath or tweet us at us or comment on the, on the medium  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:26):**  use room, obviously. And I would love to see that's more for the insight to, to make the  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:32):**  invisible visible and the root systems that are growing. How do you make a regenerative field,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:38):**  the difference between a regenerative field and a chemical one much more visible, both to invest  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:43):**  stores, obviously that's my target group, but also to the general, it's very different. If you have  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:48):**  a lot of pollinators, it's very different, but often you don't see the two different,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:52):**  obviously if you have a huge agroforestry system, you see the differences, but often it's sort of  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:13:56):**  hidden. You don't see all the plants at work. You didn't see the hidden things under the  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:01):**  hidden half of nature as the Montgomery would say underground. And that's a shame because there's,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:06):**  there's real magic happening or real nature happening there, which, which we  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:10):**  lost the ability to see and some cave actually to taste as well.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:14):**  Yeah. And I think you make a good point about agroforestry and there's actually

**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:21):**  Huge. Yeah, definitely. Check it out.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:23):**  Some really great initiative in Africa that's happening on agroforestry. There's also a great  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:29):**  little documentary video that again, from the storytelling perspective, hones in on a couple  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:34):**  of key agroforestry crops from around the world, Northern Ghana, looking at the baobab tree,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:40):**  and then in Columbia looking at the kakai tree. So really interesting agroforestry stuff happening.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:47):**  And I think, I think from my perspective, there's just the science shows over and over again that  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:53):**  agricultural systems that integrate tree crops by far capture the most carbon the most quickly,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:14:59):**  you know, on sometimes an order of magnitude greater than just the soil and tillage or  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:04):**  low tillage approaches. So I think agroforestry is a important piece and I'm hoping more and more,  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:10):**  we'll see folks adopting the systems. Yeah. And a shout out to the indigenous  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:14):**  groups that are working with the US forest service to restore an enormous amount of square  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:19):**  kilometers. I'm reading you 5,700 against fire, basically, or against out of control fire and  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:26):**  using traditional methods, which is quite interesting to see that coming back to forest.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:30):**  And we've all seen this year, but also last year and before, unfortunately, the huge forest fires.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:35):**  And I even saw, I have to find the details, a climate bond or a bond somewhere popping up to  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:40):**  against forest fire. So there's also, you see from the investor perspective also developments  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:47):**  to finance the mitigation instead of paying for the damage after which is enforced fires.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:15:53):**  Exactly. Exactly. Yep. And I think, you know, even seeing again, from an investing perspective,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:00):**  one of the largest advisors that looks at timberland investments put out the first of  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:07):**  its kind report on agroforestry as an option for integrating into timberland management strategies.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:14):**  So that's really cool because that's starting to show that. That's serious money. Yeah.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:18):**  Yeah. That's serious money that goes into timber. And so for timber to be thinking about  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:22):**  integrating, you know, non-timber forest products and agroforestry systems, very much looking  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:28):**  forward to seeing more of that. Yeah, we definitely need, I mean,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:31):**  institutional investors will be the last one on the table. I mean, you'll be at the table,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:35):**  the last one to invest, but the amounts that they can put to work are just working anything else.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:41):**  And definitely it's very interesting to see even just the word agroforestry in those kinds of  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:47):**  reports, which normal timberland investors would never, I mean, that's monoculture, just like in  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:52):**  agriculture, monoculture. And we don't want anything mixed with that. And to finalize this,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:16:57):**  this, this round up basically of news regeneration news, the newsroom, what are things we should  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:04):**  look out for, for, I see an event you mentioned here, tell us a bit about regenerative earth  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:10):**  summit and then we close with some, some holiday thoughts and potential gifts.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:15):**  So the regenerative earth summit is happening a little less than a month from now in Boulder,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:20):**  Colorado. And the theme this year is bringing together, uh, fiber and food. So there's  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:28):**  representatives from Patagonia, from the, uh, clothing side of Patagonia also from the north  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:33):**  face who have just released a very interesting product in collaboration with the nonprofit  
**[0:17:38-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:38):**  fiber shed, which does it's a hat, right? It's a hat, a little beanie with a regenerative wool.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:47):**  They use it as an example so many times as, as like one of the first products that people  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:52):**  have of regeneration and not a major brand. I haven't seen one yet live, but it's very cool.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:17:59):**  Very cool. Yeah. And then there's stuff from the food side as well. So this is going to be  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:03):**  a great summit. It's not the traditional conference. There's going to be really  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:08):**  interesting working groups discussion. So one month from now, when exactly is it?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:12):**  The date is December 4th. And I think it's the fourth to the seventh in Boulder.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:19):**  So anyone who wants to go find, click on the link, find out if you can,

**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:29):**  Great. And then also upcoming no date yet. This is more on the business side of things, but  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:34):**  the generative business summit is forthcoming probably spring 2019, which is going to be a  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:39):**  hybrid virtual and in-person event that takes some of the principles of regeneration and applies  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:46):**  them to how do you design and evolve your business. So more stay tuned for more about that.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:51):**  I'll be speaking, uh, and part of both events and be great to meet you in person. If you can  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:18:55):**  make it to either of them. Very cool. And then to finalize, I mean, the holidays are still a bit  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:00):**  away depending on where you are, but there are a number of books you mentioned. Some of you are  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:03):**  excited to read too. You mentioned you haven't read them yet. Why these two?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:08):**  I picked out Gary Paul Nabhan's new book called Niskit and a board arboreal love affair. I just  
**[0:19:15-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:15):**  love reading Gary Paul's stuff. I mean, for years he's hit this line between incredibly deep science  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:24):**  and like beautifully lyrical readable pros. His books are the most fun and informative to read.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:31):**  And so, you know, mesquite is this amazing perennial traditional crop from the borderlands  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:36):**  between the United States and Mexico. Uh, it's a nitrogen fixer. It makes this delicious flower.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:42):**  And so I just, you know, I love the plant and I can only imagine what he's going to say.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:47):**  Hey, kind of wandering around the deserts down there looking at and getting to notice  
**[0:19:51-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:51):**  and the other one is in the other one brings us to an important and probably underrepresented in  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:19:59):**  a lot of the news we're seeing aspects of regeneration, which is the social social justice  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:06):**  reparations climate justice side of regenerating agriculture. So, so this is a very powerful new  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:13):**  book by Leah Pennyman from soul fire farm, uh, in the United States. It's called farming while black.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:20):**  Yeah, I've heard about it. I saw it popping up on a number of newsletters, emails, and  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:26):**  social media, but I haven't read it yet. It's, it's, it's something that is, is very underrated.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:32):**  I think also here in Europe, you see, I mean, if you see at the end of farm workers are,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:37):**  are often either from Sub-Saharan Africa or from the East and work in conditions that we can only  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:44):**  imagine. And it's a huge hidden tragedy, basically in the agriculture sector that we somehow are not  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:51):**  able to defeat the farmers or pay for the farmers, let alone the farm workers for the food we eat.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:20:57):**  And this book is actually, you know, taking that in a way, flipping it, it's really focused on Leah  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:04):**  and the other group of farmers that she's been working with here in the Northeast and beyond  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:09):**  that are black and Latino, Latino farmers, people of color who are reclaiming agriculture,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:16):**  getting their own farms, uh, you know, repairing and restoring their communities and asking  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:22):**  white people to show up as allies as supporters for their work. So this is not going to be an  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:28):**  easy book to read. Uh, but I think it's really important. And there's one other article actually,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:33):**  um, on chickens and trees from a Latino perspective as well in the, in the newsroom.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:40):**  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And there's also a podcast with, uh,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:21:46):**  but he and Aldo who's Guatemalan originally and has a really cool tree based poultry system that

**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:01):**  Yes, definitely. I see that popping up everywhere. I mean, his podcast is in the,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:05):**  in the newsroom as well, which has been going really, really strong by John Kemp.

**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:16):**  it's the story of probably known by many, many listening to this, but it's, uh, it shows actually  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:23):**  something we discussed before in Australia, like how drought or how this case hail and four terrible

**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:40):**  the system. And he definitely started questioning a lot of systems and it shows it's an easy book.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:22:46):**  It's not too thick. I think it's around the pages or something. Maybe I must underestimate. It reads

**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/20/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-november-2018/#t=0:23:02):**  farmer language and, and, but at the same time questions a lot and shows what he's been doing.

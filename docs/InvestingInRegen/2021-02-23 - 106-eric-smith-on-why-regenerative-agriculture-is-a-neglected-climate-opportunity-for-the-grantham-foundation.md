**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:13):**  Imagine for a minute you have complete freedom and a large portfolio at your disposal to  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:18):**  focus on neglected climate change opportunities.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:21):**  What would you choose to focus on and what not?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:24):**  In today's interview we dive deep into why Eric Smith, head of the Neglected Climate  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:28):**  Change Opportunities at the Grantham Foundation, is investing in agroforestry, virtual fencing,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:33):**  biochar, microbes and remote sensing, and what he is missing in the regeneration debate  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:37):**  and what he would love to invest in.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:41):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:46):**  if the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:50):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:00:54):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:01):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:03):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:07):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:10):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:14):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:19):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:46):**  Welcome to another interview, today with Erik Smith, head of the Neglected Climate Opportunities  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:50):**  at the Grantham Environmental Trust.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome Erik.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:54):**  Thanks Kevin.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:55):**  It's an absolute pleasure and true honor to be here.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:01:57):**  You're doing incredible work building a community of practitioners and can't thank you enough  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:01):**  for doing that.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:02):**  Thank you so much for taking the time and coming on here and share some of your experience,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:07):**  investments, questions, doubts and everything else.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:11):**  But to start with a personal question, why did you end up working on soil regeneration  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:16):**  or in this case, neglected climate opportunities, but that ended up being soil?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:20):**  What was the road that led to your soil focus?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:23):**  So let me give a bit of a background just for context.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:27):**  So I worked for the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:31):**  Grantham Environmental Trust.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:33):**  So one's a private foundation, the other's a public charity that works side by side to  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:38):**  combat global environmental change.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:41):**  The foundation was founded by Jeremy and Hanalo Grantham back in 97 and later the trust in  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:47):**  the mid-2000s and then funded continually through the past two decades.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:51):**  But for those who don't know, Jeremy is co-founder and chairman of the Boston based asset management  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:02:57):**  firm, GMO, the original GMO.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:01):**  How often do you have to explain something there?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:03):**  I mean, to the, not often.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:05):**  I don't have to deal with that, but yes, I'm sure it has come up quite a bit.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:09):**  So Jeremy's what I like to refer to as an OG quant, one of the original value investors  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:14):**  and someone with just an unbelievable financial acumen.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:18):**  And he's pretty well known for having called some of the previous financial bubbles, including  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:22):**  the tech bubble of the early.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:23):**  I'm calling this one actually.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:26):**  That's coming somewhere in the next month, years.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:29):**  The last dance.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:30):**  I will link the last, the article actually, the last dance in the show notes below.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:35):**  And his papers are great.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:36):**  You can look back through some of those papers over the years and he's talked about everything  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:40):**  from the phosphorus availability levels in the future and soil erosion to many of the  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:46):**  aspects of financial markets.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:47):**  Toxicity.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:48):**  Toxicity is a big one too.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:51):**  But the majority of the organization's work has been and continues to be on the climate  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:56):**  crisis.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:03:57):**  So the two organizations side by side, and collectively I'll just refer to them as the  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:01):**  foundation, they fund strategic communication and journalism, academia and research, as  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:07):**  well as environmental NGOs and what we'd call pre-commercialization climate solutions.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:13):**  So to get to your question, why soils and how did we get here and why are we doing it?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:19):**  I manage what we refer to as our neglected climate opportunities portfolio.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:24):**  And this is our mission related investing strategy.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:27):**  It was created in 2017 to fund high impacts, greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:34):**  opportunities.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:36):**  The way this strategy developed was a bit of a modeling exercise.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:39):**  So the team looked at three metrics for various climate solutions.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:43):**  The abatement cost as measured in dollars per ton of carbon dioxide, the total abatement  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:48):**  potential of that solution, and then the amount of capital that was flowing to that sector  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:54):**  or solution.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:04:55):**  So low cost, big potential, and relevant to this conversation, truly neglected.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:03):**  At the end of that exercise, we ended up with four thematic areas.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:07):**  Soil carbon and land use being one of them.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:10):**  Seeds and seaweed, reducing methane from oil and gas operations, and the fourth, carbon  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:15):**  removal or carbon capture utilization and storage.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:19):**  So two biological and then two abiotic approaches to mitigation and sequestration.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:26):**  Then with our network of advisors and grantees, we mapped out what needed to be done within  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:31):**  each of those thematic areas, cataloging the various strategies for activating that theme  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:37):**  to become a major abatement solution.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:40):**  So that's why we ended up on soil and where I have spent most of my time over the past  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:45):**  few years as part of this work.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:48):**  And before coming to that, what was your background?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:50):**  Were you already active in, let's say, the land use space or ocean use space?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:55):**  Let's get it broader.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:05:56):**  But what was your route to the foundation?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:00):**  Yeah, so I had the fortunate experience of being a Peace Corps volunteer back in early  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:04):**  2010.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:05):**  It's a long story, but while I was waiting for my official invitation to come in from  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:11):**  the Peace Corps, I decided to head down to Costa Rica to go work on my Spanish and found  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:16):**  this place in northeastern Costa Rica on the border of Nicaragua called Laguna Del Agarto.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:24):**  And at this remote, remote jungle lodge that was owned by these Germans, I ended up camping  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:31):**  out there for six months, just giving tours and helping burgers find their way through.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:36):**  How long were you supposed to stay originally?  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:38):**  So stay for, yeah, about four or five months before my Peace Corps service started.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:43):**  But on their property, there was this sign and it was programa por pago por servicios  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:49):**  ambientales.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:50):**  So payment for environmental services.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:06:53):**  And they had something like 200 hectares enrolled in Costa Rica's payment for ecosystem services  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:00):**  program by which the landowner was receiving some benefit to ensure that the forest remained  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:06):**  intact.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:07):**  And it was just, you know, at 22 years old, just this mind blowing moment that someone  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:12):**  would pay for to keep nature intact.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:16):**  And that program has since been rolled out all over the world in various forms, has become  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:21):**  the basis of ecosystem environmental markets.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:25):**  And that was the start of my journey on discovering that there's different tools in the tool  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:29):**  bed for determining that there's a value of these ecosystem services and we have a right  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:35):**  to protect our natural capital, so to speak.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:39):**  And that's very interesting, obviously, that you're now so active in both the carbon removal,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:46):**  the storage, both biological and non-biological and all of that around.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:50):**  But it started, it started twelve, no, eleven years ago.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:52):**  That's interesting with the science somewhere in the jungle.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:07:56):**  So from there, I ended up working in microfinance with women's banking groups.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:00):**  I ended up working on recycling programs, but worked for the organization called the  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:04):**  National Fund for Financing Forestry.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:07):**  And that gave me a ton of experience in understanding kind of the flows.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:11):**  And one of the big projects I got to work on was with the World Bank with indigenous  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:15):**  territories in Dole.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:16):**  And so Dole was essentially paying indigenous territories for the water services provided  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:21):**  from their territory to their downstream plantations.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:24):**  And it was just such a cool idea and cool program.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:29):**  And then from there, I spent years in environmental auditing, less sexy, but really understood  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:35):**  the basis for what became standards and labels and certifications.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:41):**  And I got to experience the pros and cons of the systems and what was working and what  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:46):**  wasn't working.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:47):**  But from there, I ended up in grad school, did my MBA, my master of forestry.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:51):**  The basis for the master of forestry was exactly what we're talking about.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:54):**  It was I really wanted to have a conceptual understanding of how carbon was flowing through  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:08:58):**  natural systems.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:00):**  I understood that the world was going to need to rely on natural climate solutions to help  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:05):**  draw down all of the excess greenhouse gases that we've put into the atmosphere.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:10):**  And again, on that low cost paradigm, these solutions make complete sense.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:14):**  And so I wanted to be a part of that and wanted to help channel capital and resources to them.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:20):**  But then you get pulled in different directions and kind of had a stint with BlackRock and  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:24):**  their climate solutions team, stinted venture capital, working with an impact VC called  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:30):**  SJF Ventures, and then ultimately landed with the Grantham team to launch this program and  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:35):**  really to catalyze a whole suite of neglected climate solutions.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:41):**  So really great journey.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:43):**  So within the, let's say, the region ag space, as you are obviously focused on the neglected  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:49):**  parts as much as possible, which is already part of the climate solutions, it's already  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:54):**  a part that's been neglected a lot.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:09:57):**  What I mean, it's been a few years, but what have you focused on mostly or what are really  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:02):**  areas that are, let's say, when you talk to other funders, investors, etc., you're often  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:07):**  the only one looking at it or actually taking it seriously?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:10):**  What are the pieces that are extremely neglected?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:13):**  Yeah, I think that's what's so exciting about now having done this for a little bit more  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:18):**  than three years is I would no longer consider soil carbon neglected.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:23):**  No, it's everywhere.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:25):**  It's everywhere.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:26):**  I mean, so three and a half years ago, nobody was talking about it.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:29):**  It was not.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:30):**  I remember.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:31):**  Maybe, you know, small communities of practitioners and true regen farmers.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:37):**  These were very small communities.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:38):**  But now the fact that the large agriculture and company industries are talking about this  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:43):**  stuff, that's radical that that has happened in three years.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:47):**  Which gives me a lot of optimism, but we've kind of taken a scattershot approach to various  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:54):**  solutions within soil carbon and happy to talk through what those are.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:01):**  So starting kind of just theory of change.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:04):**  So really, we're focused on doing what matters due to this existential crisis.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:10):**  And you have the flexibility with the funding.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:13):**  You don't have a super, correct me if I'm wrong, but like you don't have a three year  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:17):**  return target and you don't have enormous pressure some other investors might have to  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:22):**  very quickly show results.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:24):**  You have the flexibility to focus on the neglected parts, if I'm correct.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:27):**  Nailed it.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:28):**  Totally.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:29):**  So we are definitely one of a unique set of players in the funding world, so to speak,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:35):**  or the investing world, because our mandate is different.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:38):**  Our time horizon is different.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:40):**  We are long term patient capital and we can work through the peaks and the valleys of  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:45):**  what is long term for you.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:47):**  Because I've heard that term used many different ways and forms and shapes.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:50):**  Well, let's put it this way.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:51):**  It's not the seven to 10 year venture horizon.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:54):**  So it's beyond that.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:55):**  That doesn't mean that we want to sit forever and wait for these companies to get their  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:58):**  acts together.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:11:59):**  But we definitely have a different time horizon that we're working with, which is really important.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:04):**  But I think what's one of the more unique aspects about us is that we play across the  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:10):**  capital spectrum.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:11):**  We're a relatively small team.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:13):**  How many people?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:14):**  The core team is six at this point, with a few other supporting in different ways.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:18):**  But we play across the capital spectrum.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:21):**  So we all do and weigh in on both our grants and our investment strategy.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:27):**  And so we are mission aligned across the organization.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:30):**  Now this allows us a lot of flexibility in terms of applying the appropriate capital  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:34):**  structure to these opportunities to help move them along their development path.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:40):**  And so that ranges from true philanthropic grants to organizations.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:45):**  And that's the bread and butter of what our executive director and Jeremy have been doing  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:49):**  for a long time.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:50):**  But now we're moving more into this recoverable grant, PRI, pre-commercialization bucket.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:12:58):**  And then we can begin to apply our investment capital at that pre-seed series A type stages  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:04):**  and then help these companies move along, give them structure, give them introductions,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:08):**  introduce them to our network, our grantee network.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:11):**  We really see this as a holistic model for capital that allows us to be dynamic in our  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:17):**  response to the needs of those organizations.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:20):**  And so what are some of these examples that are, because that's a very interesting flexibility  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:24):**  you have that not many have, obviously, that some of those examples of maybe technology  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:29):**  or companies or things you can talk about that are moving towards, let's say they become  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:34):**  interesting for more commercial funders or other investors that are a bit further down  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:38):**  the funnel?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:39):**  What are some exciting ones that have moved a lot in the last three and a half years or  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:43):**  three years?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:45):**  So I think probably one of my favorites is agroforestry.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:49):**  Agroforestry is much more common in tropical subtropical subsystems where that's where  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:53):**  you found it.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:54):**  Yeah, basically productivity is a lot higher so you can manage and manipulate the systems  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:58):**  much quicker.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:13:59):**  But is that a big reason you think in terms of agroforestry, why Brazil is leading or Costa  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:04):**  Rica or why you see the Ernst Goetsch and others coming from places like that, because  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:08):**  the cycles are so much faster and you can manipulate?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:11):**  I've never met anybody, people have said it, but not in that way.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:14):**  And I suddenly it makes sense, but I want to, like, is that because you can just iterate  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:18):**  much faster than, for instance, if you're in Germany or in Vermont or something like  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:23):**  that?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:24):**  Totally.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:25):**  I think it's the dominant part of why, but there's other reasons just because I think  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:29):**  those systems are also more used to working with the diversity of crops and species within  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:35):**  subsistence farming systems.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:37):**  And so that I don't want to call it ancient or indigenous knowledge, but really there's  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:42):**  just a longer practitioner, history of practice of subsisting with diverse ecosystems and  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:48):**  diverse farming systems.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:49):**  And I think that knowledge has come together coalesced into these really innovative modern  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:55):**  agroforestry systems we see in tropical subsystems.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:14:58):**  But getting them adopted into temperate systems is a whole other challenge.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:03):**  And the challenge is overcoming the traditional farming paradigm to think, again, about horizons  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:10):**  and changing our frame for how we view the system.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:15):**  And I think agroforestry really is a horizon challenge and really learning about how an  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:20):**  asset doesn't become productive and how it generates cash flow or productivity over a  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:24):**  lifecycle.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:25):**  To give you an example, we've taken two shots.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:29):**  I think we're one of the biggest funders of agroforestry at this point.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:32):**  Which says more about the space than about your investments.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:36):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:37):**  So the two organizations that we're working with, one is called the Savannah Institute,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:41):**  and they're based in the upper Midwest and are working to the genetics and the economics  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:47):**  and the systems necessary to encourage farmers to begin to adopt these systems.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:52):**  And then we also invested in a company called Propagate Ventures, which we had a few times  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:56):**  on the podcast.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:15:57):**  I will link the interviews below with the crew.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:01):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:02):**  So we were Propagate's first institutional capital.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:05):**  And I sit on their board and I work with those guys to really create the package of tools  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:09):**  and financing and analytics to help farmers make that switch and have all the resources  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:16):**  they need to adopt those systems.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:17):**  But it's a slog.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:18):**  And so we are taking both a development and grant funding tech perspective with Savannah,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:23):**  we're taking an investment perspective with Propagate and trying to move these systems  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:26):**  along side by side.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:28):**  So there's lots of examples that we can go.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:31):**  But yeah, I think that's a good one.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:32):**  And you've seen, like in the last few years, that the agroforestry space in general has  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:37):**  made those steps to become much more investment ready or much more closer to invest because  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:43):**  you've made an investment into Propagate and they might follow others and they might raise  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:47):**  other money from others in the near future as they get much more commercial focused.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:52):**  Has you seen that speed in agroforestry in the last couple of years or was it something  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:56):**  that already was there?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:16:58):**  Is it like just with the soil carbon discussion, like is it suddenly popping up?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:01):**  Or what have you seen there as you've obviously done TD on many others and have looked at  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:06):**  the tree space for quite a bit?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah, so I think what unlocks the space and makes it become more investable is two challenges.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:13):**  First, making it more turnkey solution so that it's ready to be dropped in on the farm.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:19):**  And that's the plan, the analytics, the knowledge of what trees and systems are appropriate  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:25):**  for your geography and your soil type.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:28):**  Because again, it's a whole new set of knowledge that a farmer or producer is not really accustomed  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:33):**  to having.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:34):**  So making that turnkey, having dropped in kind of analytic packages that the farmer  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:39):**  can upload a plot of land and say, oh yeah, this is perfect for chestnut and elderberry  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:44):**  and this locust short rotation timber.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:48):**  And we can bundle that up with your wheat system and do that in a way that it'll transition  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:53):**  the land over time.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:54):**  But the second aspect is capital.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:17:57):**  And there's no doubt that the upfront investment costs are completely prohibitive to farming  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:02):**  systems to farmers as they currently operate.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:05):**  So in order for us to overcome that barrier, we have to project by project de-risk and  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:12):**  show that the forecasted yield and returns are actually what we think they're going to  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:17):**  be.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:18):**  And so it's going to take time.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:20):**  But as more money comes in, it's going to de-risk it.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:23):**  The knowledge base is going to grow.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:24):**  And eventually we're bullish on the fact that maybe agroforestry one day looks like the  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:29):**  solar industry, where it's just drop in financing and projects are ready to go and farms are  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:35):**  ready to adopt these systems.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:36):**  So I'm pretty excited about it.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:39):**  And do you see, since you made that investment, because I think that's a bit of time ago,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:44):**  like interest from other institutional players, like because you said we are probably the  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:48):**  first and the biggest, not because of us, but because of the space, has that changed  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:53):**  a lot in the last 12 months, six months?  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:56):**  Is agroforestry getting at least in temperate climates further along the funnel?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:18:59):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:00):**  I'd say there's small interested parties that are still staying engaged and interested,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:05):**  but nobody's beaten down our door yet to come knock.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:09):**  I think what we're more focused on is really helping to bring some institutional foundation  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:16):**  philanthropic wealth into some trial projects and show them what it means to just own the  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:22):**  trees and not the land and to share that revenue from the trees with the farmer and really  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:28):**  think about a capital light agroforestry model that doesn't require you to go out and buy  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:32):**  $15,000 per acre farm land.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:36):**  So it's in terms of cost per carbon, that's a very interesting one, obviously.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:41):**  And next to agroforestry, if we look at that framework, we often try to use in the podcast,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:46):**  the ITN, so importance we've discussed, I don't think we need to cover it here.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:50):**  Tractability, solvability, how fixable is it?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:53):**  But the neglectedness, obviously that's in your title already.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:19:56):**  Next to agroforestry, are there other pieces that you are interested in or you're getting  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:00):**  interested in?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:01):**  Maybe you haven't made any investments or grants yet, but it's something that's bubbling.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:05):**  What do you see there that are other pieces that you can play a similar role as you have  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:08):**  been playing in agroforestry?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:09):**  Yeah, that's great.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:10):**  So I think our fundamental belief is that society is going to coalesce around these  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:16):**  practices and systems that ensure sustainability.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:19):**  There's real momentum from what I call a social license to kind of fix these systems.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:24):**  And a lot of critique.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:25):**  Let's take a small sidestep.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:27):**  There's article after article coming out, especially on the soil carbon.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:31):**  Once every week, probably there's an article like, oh, soil carbon is going to fix us,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:35):**  it's going to help us all.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:36):**  If we just change X percentage of farms, then we're fine.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:40):**  And then 10 other articles come out like, this is nonsense.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:43):**  Holistic grazing doesn't work.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:44):**  Look at these papers.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:46):**  Or cover crops don't work, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:48):**  What do you say when, let's say, your peers or people that are not in this space send  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:52):**  you those articles?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:53):**  Because I get them a lot.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:55):**  And what do you reply to that?  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:58):**  Work in progress?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:20:59):**  Like, what's the diffusion of that?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:01):**  Because it's quite interesting how sensitive it is to say that there are natural system  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:06):**  solutions and that it is that we actually stand a chance, even if we don't all go vegan  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:11):**  or really rewild half of the planet, because that's what many of these are pushing for.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:16):**  Right.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:17):**  So for us, it has to be an all of the above strategy.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:20):**  There obviously is no silver bullet and over reliance on any one solution is going to cause  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:25):**  us a lot of headaches down the road.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:26):**  So we have to do everything.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:28):**  And that's our approach to these climate solutions.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:31):**  We're really taking a scattershot approach and trying to move as many solutions along  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:34):**  their development pathway as possible.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:36):**  If one of those solutions turns out to not be as effective as research is currently stating  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:43):**  or understating, that's OK, because we're going to have other things moving ahead.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:47):**  So our investment thesis is really built around technologies and business models that enable  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:53):**  producer profitability and doing that through newer, improved systems.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:21:57):**  So in many cases for us, carbon or greenhouse gas mitigation is the byproduct of the business  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:02):**  model.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:03):**  So you're saying if farmers are more profitable, they will not automatically, but they they  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:09):**  improve their practices and thus restore store and biodiversity, water, carbon, et cetera.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:16):**  But you're focused on the profitability of the farmer, landowners, land managers, et  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:21):**  cetera.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:22):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:23):**  And I think that's the key to Agroforestry, that profitability solution is a horizon problem  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:27):**  or with Vents, one of our portfolio companies.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:30):**  Thanks again for the intro.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:31):**  Yeah, we had Frank on the call.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:33):**  An operations challenge.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:35):**  But there are also an horizon problem, actually, but it's a different horizon.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:39):**  You have to cut down the fences.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:41):**  Yeah, I love I just love daydreaming about getting rid of all the fence lines and really  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:47):**  managing for landscapes.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:48):**  I got somebody responding saying, imagine for wildlife what that means.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:53):**  Imagine an amount of an amount of life getting trapped in fences.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:22:57):**  We're so used to it because agriculture land is fencing for us.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:01):**  But not so long ago, that wasn't the case.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:03):**  And like daydreaming about that.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:05):**  And I was like that.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:07):**  Speaking of unlocking, I mean, the sky is literally the limit there.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:12):**  It's quite interesting.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:13):**  Yeah, but I guess going back to it, it is.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:17):**  And I made this clear.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:18):**  Our mandate is transformational.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:20):**  And we're continually debating this internally when we talk about transformational versus  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:26):**  incremental.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:27):**  And with incremental or said another way, small changes on big acres can have a very  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:33):**  meaningful impact on scale.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:35):**  But what we want is big changes on big acres.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:38):**  So I think our portfolio represents that all of the above approach.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:42):**  Which is interesting because your background was more on the small changes on big acreage  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:47):**  in terms of certification, etc.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:50):**  You came around.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:51):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:54):**  So the things that we're looking at in the end of the portfolio, there's a few crazy  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:57):**  things.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:23:58):**  But in general, it's like you want to go straight to some of the well, I'd say there's two buckets,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:05):**  right.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:06):**  So back to this incremental, there's the incremental stuff around conservation ag and no till cover  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:10):**  crops, crop diversity, livestock integration, improved grazing and silvopastoral systems  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:16):**  and reducing synthetic inputs and moving from conventional organic.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:21):**  But some of the other stuff around food waste and supply chain inefficiencies and agroforestry,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:27):**  I think is some of the more edgy stuff and some things I'm really excited about.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:31):**  I'll tell you about one and it's I think it's a great story because it's funny when you  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:37):**  realize that there are four times more people on this planet than there should be because  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:42):**  of a world war.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:43):**  We have literally gone from two billion humans to close to eight billion as a result of two  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:49):**  men for its harbor and Karl Bosch, who are responsible for the process by which we artificially  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:54):**  fixate nitrogen from ambient air.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:24:57):**  It is now the basis of our chemical industrial agricultural system and why the current climatic  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:03):**  conditions of the planet are at risk, because there's too many people.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:07):**  But as we move forward with mainly a group in, let's say, not in Western society, but  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:14):**  this is obviously producing the majority of the resources in a way that's completely out  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:21):**  of any context or any limits or any and a big chunk of the people.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:26):**  Most of these smaller farmers are not to be.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:30):**  I don't think they're part of the problem.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:31):**  They are definitely part of the solution, but it's the majority or the small minority  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:36):**  that's definitely living.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:37):**  Let's say the carbon budget is not equally shared among the eight billion people.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:41):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:42):**  But so that's very depressing.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:44):**  So what's the edge?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:45):**  The edge part?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:46):**  Well, the edge part is how do we get rid of that?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:48):**  How do we get rid of the Haber Bosch process, which is currently responsible for something  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:52):**  like four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions?  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:56):**  And so there's a company called Kula Bio.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:25:59):**  And as you're aware, there's certain plants that are able to fix nitrogen from the air.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:04):**  And we now know that there's microbes that can do this, too.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:06):**  So unfortunately, their life cycle is fairly short.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:10):**  And the way that they interact with the plant for their energy needs is really determines  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:15):**  the growth and productivity of that plant.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:16):**  So if they're becoming a huge suck on those plants, resources, plant can't function or  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:22):**  the microbe can't function and continue to fix that nitrogen.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:25):**  So Kula Bio is their commercializing technology that was spun out of Harvard that identified  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:30):**  a process for charging the microbes or essentially packing them with their own energy stores  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:36):**  that they can continue to last longer in agricultural applications.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:40):**  So I believe their microbes are currently lasting something like two to three weeks  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:44):**  in the field.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:45):**  And the development pathways show something like they'll be able to achieve four to five  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:48):**  X over that, covering the critical stages of plant growth.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:53):**  But fundamentally and most importantly, in field trials, the company has achieved a range  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:26:57):**  of 50 to 100 percent synthetic nitrogen replacement, which is huge.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:02):**  And this is game changing.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:04):**  And then asking the devil's advocate question in healthy soils, are they needed as well?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:09):**  Or this is like a transition or is this a transition to?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:12):**  I think in healthy soils, they will be needed.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:15):**  So naturally, those microbes would not be present that fix nitrogen.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:18):**  So if you compare it to organic fertilizers, especially nitrogen and manures or other natural  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:25):**  based nitrate sources, you have to import those to the system unless you have livestock  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:29):**  integration and livestock integration is going to be very challenging.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:34):**  I think there will be subset of models and kind of rent to cow systems where you will  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:39):**  have someone drop off a herd and use vets to kind of run that herd through your cover  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:44):**  crops.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:45):**  But I think this is a much more elegant solution, which is a simple microbe that sits next to  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:50):**  a plant, fixes the nitrogen and hopefully, fingers crossed, eliminates Haber-Bosch, which  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:27:56):**  again, has done unmeasurable damage to our soils, waterways, ecosystems.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:02):**  The amount of methane and nitrous oxide, it's just...  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:06):**  That sounds methane.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:08):**  Because you say it's four percent.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:09):**  That doesn't sound like a lot, but it is.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:12):**  I mean, if you look at the of course, the soil, the carbon damage, the carbon coming  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:19):**  out of the soil and what the industry has done, it's much larger than the current four  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:24):**  percent.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:25):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:26):**  It's it's but then it's not measured and it's not it doesn't show up in all those.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:30):**  But it would be an absolutely fundamental transformational bucket investment, I guess.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:36):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:37):**  I mean, it's just when I take a step back and I really think about how we got here,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:41):**  it's no one's fault.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:43):**  It's the collective result of our own human ingenuity to solve the problems at hand.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:47):**  And now we have a more macro level problem that we're attempting to address.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:52):**  What I think everyone misses in these conversations is the interconnectivity of these issues.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:28:57):**  This isn't a agriculture problem.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:00):**  This is a energy, agriculture, food, health crisis.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:04):**  They're all related, connecting and feeding one each other.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:07):**  I mean, it's the ag system has been fundamentally propped up by cheap energy via subsidization,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:13):**  both in terms of how we produce our food, powers our tractors, the chemical and fertilizer  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:17):**  or hydrocarbons and the transportation system, how food gets from A to B.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:22):**  California to New York.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:25):**  Or Spain to the Netherlands.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:26):**  But that might not be a huge issue if the transportation sector quickly or electrifies.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:31):**  But fundamentally, we have to phase out fossil fuels.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:34):**  So the big question is, what's the impact on food prices?  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:37):**  But then that's the next place that our government also heavily subsidizes.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:42):**  And again, what originally started as a noble intention, cheap food to feed the world became  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:47):**  a vicious feedback loop where one fed the other cheap food, more people, more people,  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:53):**  more food needed.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:29:54):**  And so now our food system has gotten so cheap that we are awash in calories and empty ones  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:01):**  read recently.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:02):**  Yeah, empty calories.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:03):**  And we actually produce more calories than we need as a global human population.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:08):**  Like we could easily feed nine or 10 million people like it.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:14):**  And so now as a result, what do we have?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:16):**  The largest health crisis ever seen.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:18):**  And of course, not talking about COVID.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:21):**  It's the chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:26):**  that are all directly attributable to our diet.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:30):**  And that creates a medical cost and lost productivity.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:33):**  It just it blows my mind that we've been listening to this health care debate for the last 12  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:37):**  years.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:38):**  And you have never heard any of these politicians talking about preventative medicine and the  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:43):**  impacts food choices and our access to have on our our well-being.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:47):**  Now, we just did an interview.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:49):**  I will link it below with Catherine.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:51):**  And she works in the California.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:54):**  I'm going to, of course, push the name.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:56):**  I think it's a serious project.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:30:58):**  So basically providing organic meals, tailored, medically tailored meals to people coming  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:03):**  out of the health system after an operation, low income, because that's the group that  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:08):**  can benefit the most, because if they don't, if they don't have the budget to eat well,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:14):**  and they come out of a hospital, the chances of them going back to the hospital of all  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:17):**  of us, if you don't eat well, are incredibly high.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:20):**  If you get 12 weeks of good food delivered to your door, suddenly the costs are neglectable  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:26):**  compared to the cost of going back to the hospital, because at the end of the month,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:30):**  you do have a bit of money left and you're not eating actually, but you are taking your  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:34):**  medicine, which obviously is a very, very dangerous combination.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:37):**  They are showing incredible results and starting to have that discussion.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:41):**  But it's very difficult, let's say very inspirational because she did over a million meals.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:47):**  But if you look at the potential and having that discussion of just good, healthy food,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:52):**  it's not that I mean, everybody takes the oath and let food be dimethicid, but it's  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:55):**  very, very tricky.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:31:57):**  But there's some little signs around there for progress.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:00):**  But asking a question, what so in this massive, completely interconnected issue field and  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:07):**  challenge field and opportunity field, if you had a magic wand and you could change  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:12):**  one thing overnight, what would that be?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:14):**  Only one?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:15):**  I always get people that then want to change one, they want to do the Aladdin trick that  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:18):**  they get more wishes.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:19):**  But this gives you only one.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:20):**  What would you do?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:23):**  It's funny, all the times I've heard that question, I love some of your other guess  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:26):**  answers.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:27):**  But before I answer, I would say what is so exciting about this space is that we do have  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:33):**  all the tools and knowledge and resources and capabilities to fix this.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:39):**  What is missing is implementation.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:41):**  That's what you said.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:42):**  Yeah, it's will.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:43):**  So you would fix will.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:44):**  I would fix will.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:45):**  I would empower people's energy and will to actually go out and address this problem.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:52):**  And I would say, more cynically, I would probably have to do that.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:55):**  I would remove vested interest in our government.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:32:58):**  I would somehow wave my wand to remove the ability of corporations to affect our political  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:05):**  process.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:06):**  I mean, the reason we're here is legacy marketing from industrial food companies that have brainwashed  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:12):**  us into believing the protein myth and believing the calcium for milk myth and all of these  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:17):**  other things that are just completely detrimental to our health and well-being and have been  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:21):**  fed by the industrial paradigm.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:24):**  So that was a lot.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:25):**  But I would change willpower.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:28):**  And imagining there's like a whole stadium, no, stadium is a bit tricky now, this COVID  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:33):**  time, let's say a theater with social distancing of other investors listening to you.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:38):**  We're on stage, we're doing this interview live.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:40):**  And somebody asks, okay, I've read the books, I've visited farms, I can see it's all interconnected.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:45):**  I would like to operate holistically here.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:47):**  Where would you, without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them where  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:50):**  to start, where to go deeper?  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:52):**  What would you point them to and say, okay, when you leave this theater, these would be  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:33:56):**  the steps if I would be in your seat, I would take first.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:01):**  So first I'd advise anyone to take a step back.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:03):**  And again, look at the interconnectivity and engage in some systems level thinking.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:07):**  What are the real pushes and pulls on the system that cause these outcomes to happen?  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:13):**  So once you have this higher level thinking, you can begin to engage in more proactive  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:21):**  thinking about solutions and think about where things can be dropped in or identified a little  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:27):**  bit easier without the friction that something won't be able to compete.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:32):**  So what I mean by that, again, back to this subsidization question.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:35):**  So cheap fuel, cheap fertilizers, cheap labor, they enable this industrial paradigm to exist.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:42):**  And until we fix that, most of us or a lot of what we're looking for is premium pricing  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:48):**  to somehow overcome those costs so that we can have business models and technologies  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:53):**  to adapt more regenerative practices.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:34:57):**  So I would encourage these investors to really look for ways that do not rely on premium  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:04):**  pricing to create value.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:06):**  And that goes back to what are the business underlying business models that either increase  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:11):**  revenue or decrease costs for the farmer to help them change their operating paradigm?  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:17):**  So I'd say that's the first part is don't get stuck in that premium pricing model.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:20):**  Obviously, organic transition finance is a great place to invest produce and food that  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:25):**  are going to continue to be a very high quality long term investments.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:29):**  However, the way we rely on and create that premium pricing, again, these labels and certifications,  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:36):**  I just think they're inherently flawed.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:38):**  Anytime you rely on a checklist of practices to achieve an outcome, you're asking for  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:43):**  the least amount of compliance.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:45):**  And so you want to look for the outcome or how would you suggest to fix that?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:49):**  Because I've done some interviews and especially one in France on outcome based like literally  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:53):**  you need to hit this and this targets otherwise you cannot be certified.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:35:57):**  Is that something that you would you base it on outcome if you would be again in the  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:02):**  certification space, obviously, or not?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:05):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:06):**  So what we need are systems that continually raise the bar on the outcomes expected and  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:11):**  what types of outcomes you measure for.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:14):**  That's the question.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:15):**  Are you measuring for carbon?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:16):**  Are you measuring for quality or nutrient density?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:19):**  Are you measuring for increases in biological diversity and insect productivity on the farm?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:25):**  There's ways to show that we're achieving these things without standing next to a producer  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:30):**  and showing saying, show me your chemical storage shack.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:33):**  And I want to see that you're not having any synthetic chemicals inside here.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:36):**  Show me your invoices.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:37):**  Yeah, it's just just about raising everyone up together and setting the bar higher and  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:43):**  higher over time.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:45):**  And everybody understands that consumers are just absolutely inundated with labels and  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:50):**  nobody needs another label that says it's just not going to have the effect.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:54):**  I'm supportive of these efforts.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:56):**  I just don't think it's going to fundamentally change the food system.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:36:59):**  It's not the transformative.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:02):**  And so in the transformative bucket, what are you missing?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:05):**  What are you like hoping that ends up on your, that knocks on your door, apart from more  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:10):**  people that want to invest in agroforestry, but what is missing from the investor discussion  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:15):**  currently that you're having with peers, with other people, with what would excite you if  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:21):**  knocked on your door?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:22):**  We do this exercise all the time.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:24):**  We ask ourselves, what do we want?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:25):**  What are we looking for?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:26):**  And then all of a sudden it appears and you're just, you're like, yeah, it's about the intention.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:32):**  So let me give you one.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:34):**  There's a company.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:35):**  So I've been a big fan of the biochar space for years and there's so many of us.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:39):**  And somehow it didn't explode yet.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:42):**  That's why I know Peter quite well.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:44):**  I'm Peter Oliver that's doing the biochar deep dive, which I'm very happy about it.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:49):**  Somebody is taking deep dive interviews around that, but yeah, it's like, why not yet?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:54):**  Like what's happening there?  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:56):**  What is not happening yet?  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:57):**  So what is your view on that?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:37:59):**  So it's funny.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:00):**  My first introduction to the Grantham Foundation was via consulting project to go do diligence  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:05):**  on a gasification technology that would produce biochar from animal manure.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:11):**  And that was really compelling because it was solving manure management issues and creating  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:16):**  a really high profile soil amendment that was not just woody carbon based, but also  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:22):**  had elements of the recovered nutrients from that manure.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:25):**  So I got really excited about it.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:27):**  We looked at it a lot.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:28):**  I actually had some initial conversations in North Carolina while I was in grad school,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:32):**  trying to set up a system whereby we would address some of the swine and poultry manure  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:39):**  challenges in North Carolina.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:42):**  Great renewable energy credit system.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:43):**  The way gasification system work is kind of in between combustion and paralysis.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:48):**  There's a little bit more oxygen presence to get much more syngas produced, which can  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:53):**  produce a nice renewable energy stream.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:56):**  And then you can sell heat.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:57):**  But I hear a bot coming.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:38:59):**  It's just any time you're heating manure in that way, there's going to be unintended side  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:03):**  consequences and you have to question the quality of that char.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:07):**  And I think that's been one of the roadblocks for the biochar industry has just been the  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:11):**  range of production technologies, the range of outcomes in the char and transportation  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:18):**  and the long term value in the soil.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:22):**  It's hard because it's almost it can be a one time application.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:24):**  It can be a 20 time application.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:27):**  But research is coming along, let's say.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:28):**  So anyways, I've looked at about 15 different biochar companies over the years really trying  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:33):**  to say, what are we solving for?  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:35):**  What do we want?  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:36):**  And what we are always after was in field paralysis, something that can take corn stover,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:43):**  leftover green residuals or a part of them and actually char them directly in the field  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:48):**  and leave them where they are.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:50):**  Instead of leaving them there decomposed by itself, like this is much faster.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:54):**  And actually you go up a few levels in terms of effectiveness.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:39:58):**  And permanent is again what we're after.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:01):**  Permanent storage is very rough.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:04):**  And we can unpack the carbon credit conversation a second here, but that's got to be a whole  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:08):**  other hour.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:11):**  But a company called Stay tuned for part two.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:14):**  Climate robotics, we identified and Jason was a longtime biochar engineer and had been  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:20):**  around the space and co-founder.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:23):**  They are developing basically an in-field mobile robotic paralysis unit that's going  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:28):**  to process the harvest residue and biochar it and leave it in the field.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:33):**  And in terms of a business model, it doesn't rely on carbon credits.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:36):**  So it doesn't rely on the premium issue in terms of food, in this case, in terms of credits.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:41):**  So what does it rely on?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:43):**  So with the excess fertilizer and synthetic chemicals that we've been dumping all over  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:48):**  our lands, our soil has become much more acidic.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:51):**  And so now we have to add literally tons and tons of base or alkaline material to our soils,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:40:58):**  primarily in the form of lime to help restore the pH balance of the soil.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:03):**  So adding biochar is one of the ways to confront that acidity.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:07):**  And basically the char will be acting as a lime replacement directly in a field.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:12):**  So we have a business model whereby we just it's going to be cheaper and more efficient  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:18):**  to do the system, then truck in tons of lime, three tons per lime of lime per acre into  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:24):**  your system.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:26):**  And then you have permanent carbon sequestration via that char.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:29):**  So something that's one of my, you know, was dreaming of looking for and then finally found  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:35):**  it and it was like, oh, yeah, this is great.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:38):**  So this one you found, but what is out there?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:40):**  You don't know maybe, but what are you still hoping for that door behind you that somebody  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:43):**  knocks on?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:44):**  Well, here's a big one that we just putting it out there.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:47):**  So maybe, you know, now in the next month's magically somebody knocks on the door.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:51):**  Not saying that it came through this podcast, but in general, just putting the attention  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:55):**  intention in the universe helps.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:56):**  I guess taking a step back.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:41:58):**  So how do we manipulate bacteria and fungi to grow rapidly into the soil?  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:04):**  And I just saw the movie, by the way, Fantastic Fungi, which is beautifully done or the document.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:09):**  It's absolutely stunning.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:10):**  I put that I'll put the link below.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:12):**  Go and watch it if you haven't just to learn and see.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:16):**  It's ridiculous.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:17):**  It's very good to supercharge them to grow faster.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:21):**  And so can you add a seed coating or some other type of amendment that would essentially  
**[0:42:28-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:28):**  begin in a fairly symbiotic relationship with the plant and then consume a lot of the inactive  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:36):**  inorganic compounds in the soil to grow quickly and manipulate and into the soil and also  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:43):**  be durable.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:44):**  So it's not a type of fungi or bacteria that is going to be easily consumed within a very  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:50):**  short time period.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:52):**  So the challenge and this is what it's kind of contrary to the principles of biodiversity  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:57):**  in the soil.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:42:58):**  And I was going to say, like, do you again, do you need that?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:00):**  Same question.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:01):**  Do you need that in a healthy soil?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:03):**  That's what we struggle with is if you coat all these seeds and they all shoot this one  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:07):**  type of, you know, there's a company called Soil Carbon Company based in Australia that  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:12):**  is working with a melanin endophytic fungi.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:16):**  What happens when you add all of that material to the soil and at what point does the diversity  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:23):**  of microbes eventually learn to eat that material and then it respires?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:27):**  So what could be the durability or the permanence of that solution?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:31):**  And because that's going to be the fastest way to just pump carbon into the ground.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:35):**  But then you don't want to come if it come back as a boomerang when soil responds very  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:39):**  quickly, potentially, and suddenly releases whatever we haven't figured.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:44):**  Like, it's a that's a risky move.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:46):**  Very interesting, but very risky.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:47):**  Right.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:48):**  Yeah, you don't we just don't know.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:50):**  We just don't know.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:51):**  And the really scary part and the thing that keeps me up at night is the pace at which  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:55):**  change is accelerating.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:43:57):**  And we have a pretty good fundamental understanding of how temperature and humidity and moisture  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:03):**  are going to shift and climatic growing zones are going to change.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:08):**  But the speed of that change is a happening faster than we anticipated and be creating  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:14):**  a situation where plants may not be able to thrive in those situations.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:19):**  And so I'm really concerned about how that temperature swing and moisture swing is going  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:23):**  to activate, increase respiration within the soil and really that negative feedback really  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:29):**  starts looking pretty grim pretty quick.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:32):**  And in a great bridge to another part of the region I accepted, I'm very interested in  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:38):**  I don't see a lot of activity.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:40):**  We've talked about it before as well.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:41):**  How do you bring this to a landscape scale?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:43):**  Like what happens if you really bring regenerative practices approaches to not just one farm,  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:50):**  not just two, not just five, but actually to a landscape scale.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:44:54):**  We've seen some examples where you actually start influencing the local climate and start  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:00):**  damping those swings, start bringing back rain in some places, bringing back rivers,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:04):**  et cetera.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:05):**  Like there are very edgy things that are happening in terms of if you restore the water cycle.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:10):**  We had Walter Yen on the podcast, which might be out now, might not depends a bit, but otherwise  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:14):**  I put it in the, depends on the order, I put it in the show notes.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:18):**  Like there's some exciting edgy things happening there.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:21):**  What are you seeing there?  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:23):**  Because for sure you're looking at it.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:25):**  I mean, that's one of the things that I think we've fundamentally neglected as a society  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:30):**  is the impact of trees and the carbon cycle and the evapotranspiration effect of how massive  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:37):**  amounts of trees can affect microclimates.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:39):**  Right.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:40):**  And so that's why I'm really excited about agroforestry because you can fundamentally  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:43):**  preserve microclimates or prevent that rapid change on a macro level when you're managing  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:48):**  at a landscape level.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:50):**  I wish we were doing more here.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:51):**  I would say a lot of the remote, we're in two kind of remote sensing biogeochemical  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:45:56):**  model companies and two, they have taken two very different approaches.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:01):**  And one of them originally started as exactly trying to answer this question.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:06):**  So working with seed companies and producers to understand how quickly the climate conditions  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:12):**  were going to change and how to adapt to those conditions by evolving their seeds and their  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:17):**  varietals.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:18):**  That company has since become SIBO technologies, which is trying to be a Zillow for agriculture  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:25):**  and provides a regen platform where you can understand the regen potential of every acre.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:31):**  And alternatively, Dagen, which uses the DNDC model some of your other guests have spoken  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:36):**  about, they take a really landscape modeling approach to greenhouse gas flux from ag systems.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:42):**  And so the goal in some of the work that we're doing with the Nature Conservancy is modeling  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:48):**  on a corn belt level, on a state level, on a county level, what those greenhouse gas  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:53):**  fluxes are from the system and then providing and then via TNC avenues for managing and  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:46:59):**  manipulating those fluxes in meaningful ways.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:02):**  Because most of America at any state or local county level, most of their greenhouse gas  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:08):**  footprint is only going to be the agriculture system.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:11):**  And so as they begin to manage and look for ways to reduce that footprint, they need that  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:14):**  information.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:15):**  So we're systematically providing that landscape level greenhouse gas data to hopefully the  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:20):**  globe.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:21):**  But right now it's pretty US heavy.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:22):**  But I think it's safe to say that you would love to see more in that space.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:28):**  Well, I think we need to fund more, again, systems level thinker who are thinking, and  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:31):**  I think TNC is actually rolling something out on what they're calling food sheds or  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:35):**  food level systems to begin to think about intercooperativity.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:40):**  We have to.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:43):**  Back in my ecosystem service days, this wasn't a farm concept.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:45):**  It was a jurisdictional.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:48):**  And you would think about basically the flux from that system and managing a whole jurisdiction  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:52):**  as opposed to a project.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:55):**  And we just need a more macro systems level look.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:47:58):**  And you need people who are thinking at that level.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:01):**  It's got to be a combination of academic and governmental entities that are coming together  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:04):**  to really drive those conversations forward.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:07):**  And hopefully a few farms.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:09):**  Have you found anything interesting on that kind of landscape level manipulation or thought?  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:14):**  Not.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:15):**  I mean, I think you can even put fence in that as well.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:19):**  It's some of the underlying technology that we're going to need to manage at a landscape  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:23):**  level.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:24):**  I've definitely seen work, let's say much more on the organizational level in the landscape  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:29):**  itself or on common land in Spain, but also in South Africa, et cetera.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:33):**  They really together with WWF or the sustainable landscape finance lab with Paul Chatterton.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:39):**  And there are a few people that are looking at a landscape level and taking a landscape  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:42):**  approach, but mostly let's say starting on the ground, literally with the farmers, with  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:48):**  the local NGOs, et cetera.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:49):**  The technology switch to what actually, what should we plan where and why?  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:54):**  And what does that potentially have a, what kind of impact could that have?  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:57):**  Or how many trees do you need to plan where and why?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:48:59):**  Which is a question John Kempf actually asked Walter Jena and I also asked.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:03):**  Obviously the answer is it depends, but just the fact that we can ask that question, like  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:07):**  how many trees do you need to plan where to influence the cloud system above it?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:12):**  Or just the fact that it switches from rain brings trees.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:16):**  Now it's actually trees bring rain or, and that kind of discussion or vegetation, which  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:20):**  I think is a, is, and I think I've seen way too little.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:24):**  I just finished an interview with Judith D. Swartz on the reindeer Chronicles, her latest  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:28):**  book where she basically took a landscape approach on a number of landscapes and showed  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:33):**  that, but it's not a big book, like because there are not so many of these approaches,  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:37):**  but I think as soon as we see the potential, because this is enormous, this goes way beyond  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:41):**  one farm, one farmer, one farmer family, one collective going through a transition.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:46):**  This is actually, this is climate tempering.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:49):**  If we want to, this is bringing back water cycles.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:51):**  This is biodiversity through the roof.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:54):**  If you want to like this, bring that light back life in many places where it's basically  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:49:59):**  desertified.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:00):**  If you look at Spain, et cetera.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:01):**  So I'm very excited.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:02):**  I haven't seen a lot of the very high level system thinking and then very practical.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:08):**  What do we need to do in the landscape?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:10):**  Like tell us where to plant and what to plant and tell us what to change in terms of practices,  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:15):**  because then you can actually go and do it.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:17):**  And then I think the social, the implementing part becomes the financing part, because then  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:21):**  it becomes a horizon problem again, like you mentioned with agroforestry, if you know what  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:25):**  to do, where and why you can start looking for finance.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:28):**  And I think it's out there.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:30):**  It's much more.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:31):**  We need the tools, the handles.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:32):**  We need the basically we need the next steps in that process.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:35):**  You cannot just say, let's bring back an ecosystem.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:38):**  What are the steps in that evolved and why does it matter to start there and not there?  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:42):**  Because we have limited resources.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:44):**  I mean, I really hope that there you have at least a few people from the USDA who are  
**[0:50:49-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:49):**  listening to these podcasts because they have all the, there are a few, they have the tools.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:55):**  The conservation title is part of the farm bill.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:50:57):**  I'm actually for the first time, pretty bullish on some of the USDA approaches, the carbon  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:02):**  bank and Senator Booker is talking about ramping up conservation funding, but that's where  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:07):**  this knowledge has to sit is at the federal level.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:10):**  And they have to move these resources in a more concerted way to influence these changes.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:15):**  And it can't just be don't till this year.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:20):**  It's like when, how are we going to systematically rewild parts of our landscape?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:24):**  This is a 20 year discussion.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:26):**  And who's doing that?  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:27):**  No one is thinking on that level and that is concerning, but it's nice knowing that  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:31):**  we have the tools and ability to do that if people were to get their act together.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:36):**  Because I, if you look at the examples like Judith mentioned in her book, I mean, against  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:41):**  all odds, this is happening in some places at very small scale in some cases are very  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:45):**  like, you have to very look very carefully, but imagine if you actually would resource  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:50):**  them well, imagine what they would be able to do and what people on the ground would  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:54):**  be able to do if you had the tools that are there, but they're just not in their hands  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:51:58):**  because they're completely disconnected from a lot of cases, technology, but also the finance  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:03):**  world.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:04):**  And if, I mean, that, that really excites me, but it's also a huge gap between the two  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:08):**  at the moment.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:10):**  And so to, I want to be conscious of your time as well to finish with a final question.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:14):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:18):**  This is definitely inspired slash stolen slash taken from John Kemp, often asked about, let's  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:24):**  say extractive agriculture in general.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:27):**  I like to ask it about region ag, like what do you believe to be true?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:30):**  Where are you contrarian compared to others?  
**[0:52:32-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:32):**  I'd say on the more negative side, I'm concerned that it's a fad and it's, I really just don't  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:39):**  want it to become the next sustainable lingo word.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:43):**  And when you see companies like Cargill is talking about doing regenerative on 10 million  
**[0:52:48-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:48):**  acres, that's where things get concerning.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:50):**  And it goes back to your conversations about practices versus outcomes versus true holistic  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:56):**  models.  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:57):**  I mean, what is it?  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:52:58):**  And I've seen this play out with sustainability.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:00):**  I've seen this play out with impact.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:03):**  There's just real concern there.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:04):**  And so I'd ask, and what I think to be true is just what are the intrinsic truths about  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:09):**  what we want from the food system?  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:12):**  And that's, what's going to last.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:13):**  And I think what people want is health and wellness.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:16):**  I think that's going to be a truth.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:19):**  And that will be something that pulls the region ag community forward is talking about  
**[0:53:25-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:25):**  quality food and health outcomes.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:28):**  So and that's the way we're going to support a kind of decentralized, decommoditized farming  
**[0:53:34-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:34):**  system, which is the dream.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:36):**  So I think we need to keep that for another one where we go deep in food as medicine,  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:40):**  nutrient density and all of that.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:41):**  But I think it's an excellent answer.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:44):**  Where are we in the hype cycle and how far are we going to come down in that hype cycle,  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:48):**  which is the scary part.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:49):**  Then we're going to go up again.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:50):**  I'm not too concerned about it, but the whole deflating of the hype is going to be painful  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:55):**  to watch.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:56):**  But let's hang in there.  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:57):**  I want to thank you so much for your time, Eric.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:53:59):**  And it was a real pleasure to dive deep into many of these.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:54:02):**  And I hope it's not the last one.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:54:04):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:54:05):**  This is definitely a long term relationship.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:54:06):**  And again, thank you for having me on and for bringing this community together.

**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:56:58):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:00):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:04):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:09):**  different means.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:10):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:15):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:18):**  Thank you.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:19):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:57:20-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:20):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:26):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:28):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:57:33-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:33):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:39):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:57:43-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:43):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:45):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:50):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:54):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:57:59):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:58:00-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:00):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:02):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:04):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:08):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:10):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-smith#t=0:58:15):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

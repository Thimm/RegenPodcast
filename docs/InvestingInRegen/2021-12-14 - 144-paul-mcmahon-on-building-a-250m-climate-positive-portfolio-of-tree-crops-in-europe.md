**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:14):**  Finally a check-in with one of the oldest and most successful asset managers in regenerative  
**[0:00:18-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:18):**  agriculture.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:19):**  After five years he's back on the podcast to share the updates on their investment strategies  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:24):**  in Australia and the US, the forestry fund in Ireland and their latest strategy, a 250  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:30):**  million tree crop fund focused on Europe.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:32):**  Why are they focusing on orchards, tree crops, etc. and why on Europe?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:43):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:48):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:52):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:07):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:12):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:16):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of SLM Partners, Paul McMahon.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:48):**  Welcome back on the show, Paul.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:49):**  Hi, Kon.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:50):**  Great to be here and great to talk to you again after so many years.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:52):**  Yeah, we do check in and chat in the meantime, but the last episode we recorded was number  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:57):**  three actually, which is five years ago.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:59):**  One of the first episodes we ever recorded.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:01):**  So I'm very happy to have you back.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:03):**  I'm very happy that SLM Partners is still alive and kicking in the region egg investment  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:07):**  space and if we can have this update.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:09):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:10):**  Great to be here and yeah, I look forward to fill you in some of the things we've been  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:12):**  working on and what we're planning to do in the next few years.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:16):**  So let's start with a brief overview.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:18):**  I will obviously link the interview we did five years ago in the show notes below plus  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:22):**  links to the website, et cetera.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:24):**  But in a few sentences, where is SLM or a few more sentences, I mean, we have time.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:30):**  Where does SLM stand as we're talking now, November 2021?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:33):**  Yeah, so it's been a busy five years since we last spoke.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:36):**  You know, I think we're continuing to develop a asset management firm that can use investment  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:41):**  capital to scale up more regenerative ecological farming and forestry systems.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:45):**  That's always been the mission since we started 10 years ago and that's still very much at  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:49):**  the core of what we do.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:50):**  We've got three different strategies now around the world.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:54):**  We actually started in Australia where we raised a grass fed beef cattle fund 2012.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:57):**  I know you've had my partner Tony Lovell on the show a couple of times.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:02):**  We sadly passed away recently, but we're continuing that work in Australia.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:05):**  We acquired over a million acres of land.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:08):**  We're using holistic plant grazing to restore grasslands in a big way.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:11):**  We also have some quite big carbon projects there, which have been a great success.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:15):**  So that's in Australia.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:16):**  In the US, we have a team out of New York where we are investing in organic farming.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:21):**  And our core strategy there is we find organic farmers, mostly grain farmers in the Midwest  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:26):**  who want to grow.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:27):**  We work with them to find land.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:29):**  We then acquire that land and enter into long-term leases with the farmers.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:32):**  So 10 year leases on quite flexible terms, which really helps them through that organic  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:36):**  transition and gives them long-term access to land as well.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:39):**  And that's been going well.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:40):**  We set up a couple of separate accounts.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:41):**  One with a very large institutional investor.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:43):**  We've bought about 10 farms over the last two years.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:46):**  And we're actually participating in three or four different auctions this week.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:50):**  So hopefully we'll have some more by the end of this week.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:53):**  So that's been going well.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:54):**  And then in Europe, we raised a forestry fund in 2018.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:58):**  Focus on Ireland, my homeland.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:59):**  We raised a fund backed by the European Investment Bank's natural capital financing facility  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:03):**  and most European investors.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:05):**  And what we'll be doing there is acquiring existing semi-mature forest properties, which  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:11):**  have been built up through government grants and government support over the last 20 years.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:15):**  A little bit neglected now, quite fragmented.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:17):**  So we're aggregating them into a portfolio, putting them under professional management.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:22):**  But the key impact story there is shifting away from the conventional methods of forestry  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:26):**  in Ireland, which is very much based on clear felling and monocultures.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:29):**  Shifting away from that to something called continuous cover forestry.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:32):**  So we maintain permaforest cover.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:33):**  We selectively harvest.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:35):**  We promote more diversity within the forest.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:37):**  We think we get a great commercial result, but also get a lot of environmental benefits  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:40):**  as well.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:41):**  So that fund's been 80% deployed.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:42):**  We bought a lot of properties.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:43):**  It's going well.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:44):**  And it's very pleased with that.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:46):**  So I think altogether now we've got almost $200 million in assets in the management.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:50):**  We're just as excited as ever about what we find on the ground, talking to these great  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:55):**  farmers, great foresters who have expertise in ecological management, which are profitable.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:00):**  Has that changed a lot?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:01):**  Has that shifted?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:02):**  What have you seen on the ground?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:04):**  I don't think it's shifted.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:05):**  I think those farmers and foresters have always been there.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:08):**  And I think probably just more time has passed.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:10):**  Therefore, yes, more proof, let's say, in demonstration of track record or an impact  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:15):**  and profitability is there.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:17):**  I think then there are market forces continue to align to get behind some of these ideas  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:24):**  too, whether that's the growth of organic food markets, whether it's new regenerative  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:29):**  agriculture schemes, whether it's a keener focus on multifunctional forestry.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:35):**  So I think, yes, certainly the consumer demand and policy regulatory environment continues  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:38):**  to shift in its favor.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:40):**  But I think the operators will have been doing this quietly for decades.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:43):**  Just now maybe they're getting a bit more attention, which is a good thing.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:46):**  And on the investor side, has it shifted over the last, I hope so, but I'm looking forward  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:50):**  to hear from you in the last five years, because I remember with Tony when I met him, I think  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:55):**  11 years ago, let's say the first managed grazing, holistic managed grazing fund, I  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:01):**  think one of the first in the world in Australia, it wasn't easy even mentioning grazing differently  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:06):**  or grass.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:07):**  There was a lot of explanation explaining to do in this case.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:10):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:11):**  I really hope you say yes.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:13):**  But did you see that it has shifted even in the last five years?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:15):**  What is your feeling on the ground of the investor side of things, not necessarily the  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:18):**  land steward?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:19):**  Yeah, I think probably the biggest change has been on the investor side.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:22):**  There's definitely much greater appetite for what we do.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:24):**  I think it's driven by two things.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:26):**  On the one hand, you have almost a purely financial imperative where you have big institutional  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:31):**  investors worried about low yields from bonds, overpriced equities, looking for diversification,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:38):**  carving allocations to real assets.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:40):**  Within real assets, then they might do infrastructure, real estate, but increasing now allocating  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:45):**  maybe 1%, 2% to timber and farming.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:47):**  So I think we're seeing more and more of that, more of these allocations to our area because  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:51):**  they want diversification, inflation, hedging and purely financial, let's say, characteristics.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:56):**  But then of course, the other big driver is really coming from more the impact side.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:59):**  It's coming from climate change and policy and drivers.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:03):**  There's a huge interest in nature-based climate solutions at the moment, in biodiversity,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:07):**  waste restoring, carbon in the ground, on the ground.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:10):**  So I think that's, and a lot of these investors are making commitments themselves to their  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:13):**  stakeholders which they need to meet.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:15):**  And so managers who can put together strategies with the right institutional scale and quality  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:20):**  and the right persistence and processes, I think we'll get a good reception now, more  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:24):**  so than say five years ago.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:26):**  And now you sort of extended your view on Europe.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:30):**  I mean, you're focused obviously on the continuous cover.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:32):**  The forestry side of things, which we talked about in the last interview, and also you  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:36):**  wrote a great white paper on it.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:38):**  I will link it below because it's very, it can be very visual as well to see the difference  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:41):**  between clear fell, which just for the listeners is basically a mature forest where all the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:46):**  trees are the same size and height and they're cut at exactly at the same time.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:49):**  So you see this big scar in the middle of the landscape left and right, you see still  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:53):**  the forest that is maybe going to cut next year or in two years time, compared that to  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:58):**  continuous cover, basically very selectively harvesting.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:01):**  So you can see some great comparison in photos and why it makes a lot of sense also from  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:05):**  the return perspective, which is great when you're talking to pure financial investors.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:09):**  So I will link that white paper below and you see the results in Ireland.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:13):**  And you decided that, let's say you wanted to focus more on permanent crops in Europe.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:19):**  Why that focus?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:20):**  I mean, you're doing a lot of work in the US.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:21):**  I think there's an endless appetite there for organic shifts, et cetera.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:25):**  And yet you decided to not focus on that for the next five years.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:27):**  But actually, I mean, that will continue, but also set up a more pure focused strategy  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:32):**  in Europe and beyond Ireland because that obviously that work continues.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:36):**  Yeah, no, we'll continue our work in the US and we're looking to actually expand there  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:40):**  and not away from organic grains towards more permanent crops to actually to separate canister  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:44):**  actually.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:45):**  So it's kind of nice in a way the two geographies are going in parallel.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:47):**  I think in Europe, we were having a great experience with the Irish Forestry Fund, but  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:51):**  we're coming to close to full deployment thinking what to do next.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:54):**  And we'd love to do a second fund in Europe.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:56):**  And one thing we found in Ireland is while the investment thesis really works, there  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:00):**  is a limit to how much scale you can get.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:02):**  It just goes to small country and fragmented forest estate.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:05):**  And so if we wanted to develop a more institutional scale and quality fund, then we would need  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:10):**  to look to a broader set of European geographies.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:12):**  So we started looking at other European geographies, looking at forestry.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:15):**  I think we also decided to then expand away from pure forestry towards more permanent  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:19):**  crop orchard systems where we found some really good opportunities in Spain and Portugal,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:23):**  as well as more mixed agroforestry systems where you're mixing trees with grazing or  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:27):**  trees for crops.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:28):**  So I think what we're designing now is a broader pan-European tree crop fund.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:34):**  We're looking to raise 250 million euros.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:37):**  Sorry, 250, 250.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:38):**  250 million euros, yeah.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:41):**  About half of that will be allocated to forestry, but the other half will be allocated to permanent  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:45):**  crops, orchard crops, Mediterranean food crops, as well as agroforestry systems.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:50):**  Investing in a number of countries, so Ireland, but also looking at the Baltic states, looking  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:54):**  at Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:55):**  And we'll continue to look at some other geographies as well.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:57):**  So yeah, I think we're very excited with that.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:59):**  We're building up a team in the UK and Ireland and also in Spain and Portugal, executing  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:03):**  that.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:04):**  And we've had a first close, back with some family offices and hoping to do our first  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:07):**  investments in Spain and Portugal in the next few weeks, actually, which are coming together.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:12):**  Busy weeks, busy weeks.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:13):**  And so what made that shift possible or interesting for you from pure forestry, which you could  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:20):**  have done, let's say, a continuous forest fund in Europe focused on the Baltics.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:24):**  I mean, there are other places where there's space beyond Ireland, but you decided to expand  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:29):**  that vision beyond pure forestry into orchards, into maybe even some silver pasture, etc.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:35):**  What was that?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:36):**  What made you interested in the food side of things?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:38):**  But what made you decide to mix those things in one fund?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:41):**  Yeah, I would say I think there are some limitations to scalability in forestry in Europe.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:46):**  We have looked at multiple countries now over the last two years.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:49):**  And yes, there are pockets of opportunity, but I think there's also certain countries  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:53):**  where it can be hard to invest, maybe because land might be controlled by the governments,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:58):**  by the state, maybe because actually asset prices have been bid up so high now that the  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:02):**  returns are super low.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:04):**  So I think we have seen pockets of opportunity, but I don't think it's hard to get the kind  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:07):**  of scale which investors are used to in the US or Australia, Latin America.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:12):**  So I think that that was one of the impulses for us to look more broadly.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:15):**  I think also as a firm, we've done work in grazing, we've done work in annual cropping  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:19):**  systems, organic systems, and we've done work in forestry.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:22):**  In a way, the last piece of the puzzle was these permanent crop systems.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:26):**  And so it's something that we've always been interested in, and we've always thought there's  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:29):**  opportunities there.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:30):**  And I think it's always been probably almost a question for the team as well, what does  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:34):**  regenerative agriculture look like within a permanent crop system?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:38):**  What does it mean for permanent crops?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:39):**  Because one thing we found is regenerative agriculture movement is much more developed  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:43):**  when it comes to grazing livestock, when it comes to annual cropping systems.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:47):**  But you start digging into permanent crops and orchard systems that you don't find the  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:51):**  same body of research, the same definitions, or the same, let's say, agreement in what  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:55):**  it really means.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:56):**  So that became a really interesting puzzle for us to try and then to work through.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:00):**  And I think as we dig in and as we found some great operators in Spain and Portugal and  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:04):**  elsewhere doing some amazing things, we got more and more excited about the opportunities  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:09):**  that were there.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:10):**  And I think the final point is we wanted to build a diversified portfolio.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:15):**  So I think there's an attraction to that for investors.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:16):**  So it's forestry, which is selling to timber markets.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:20):**  You have almonds or olives or pistachio orchards selling to food markets.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:24):**  And we're also looking at something like cork, growing cork, which is selling in a completely  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:28):**  different market for wine bottle stoppers and other uses.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:31):**  So they're completely uncorrelated.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:33):**  So you get amazing diversification if you invest in these wide range of tree crops.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:36):**  I think the final point, though, as well, is around carbon.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:39):**  I think the other real goal of this fund is to build a climate positive portfolio where  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:43):**  we're storing more carbon than we emit and having a focus on tree crops, broadly defined,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:48):**  really gives you that.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:49):**  Whether it's forestry, whether it's permanent crops, you're storing a huge amount of carbon  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:52):**  within that woody biomass as well as in the soil.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:56):**  Can you describe, obviously visually as we're in a podcast, but how would an orchard look  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:01):**  like and how would it be different from, let's say, a neighbor or somewhere down the street  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:05):**  or the path where they are not applying regenerative practices?  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:09):**  Like what have been things that you found in this journey when you're finding these  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:13):**  operators, these farmers that are doing things that you get excited about?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:17):**  What should we envision?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:18):**  Because we don't talk about olives very much or almonds.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:21):**  I mean, sometimes when we talk about common land and some others, but you're right, we  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:25):**  usually talk about livestock, annual crops, maybe market gardens, et cetera, but not so  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:29):**  much about the perennial ones.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:31):**  So take us on a journey to some of the exciting ones in Portugal and Spain that hopefully  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:35):**  soon will be part of the portfolio.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:37):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:38):**  So I think there's two reasons why we like perennial crops.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:42):**  I think first just the financial returns.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:45):**  In many cases, these orchard systems are growing high value food products, which are much in  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:50):**  demand, whether it's almonds, or azaleas, pistachios, vegetarian products, and have  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:55):**  a lot of uses.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:56):**  And as we see shifts in diet, whether it's away from meat, towards almond milk, or whether  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:00):**  it's just towards that Mediterranean diet, which has all the proven health benefits,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:04):**  we see increasing demand for these products.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:06):**  They can be grown in relatively small regions of the world, which have a Mediterranean climate.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:11):**  So there's a lot of places where you can grow them.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:13):**  A lot of places where they are growing, such as California, are quite stressed by water  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:16):**  scarcity at the moment.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:17):**  So that's an understatement.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:20):**  So we think there's a really nice alignment of factors there, which mean that these are  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:24):**  good areas to invest, you can produce good returns if you're growing these products.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:27):**  That's the first point.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:28):**  I think the second is again going back to carbon, what I mentioned before.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:31):**  When done well, these systems can store carbon.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:34):**  If you think of carbon in farming or in landscapes, there's almost a clear tiering that goes on,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:41):**  where yes, you can make gains in annual cropping systems, but they're probably the smallest  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:44):**  gains per hectare.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:45):**  The next step is grazing or shifting from annual cropping to perennial grasslands that  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:49):**  stores carbon.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:50):**  But then the third after that is permanent crop systems, perennial woody tree crops,  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:55):**  and then beyond that forestry.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:56):**  So we think it's going to be good for climate, good for the environment to take some of the  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:01):**  degraded land, which is then being over-tilled and over-exploded for annual agriculture,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:05):**  and shifting to these more perennial systems.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:07):**  So that's the macro trend we like.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:10):**  The reality, of course, is that if you look at these orchard systems now as they're conventionally  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:14):**  managed, there can be quite a few problems associated with them.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:16):**  They tend to be very intensively managed, relying on heavy use of inputs, whether it's  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:20):**  synthetic fertilizer, pesticides, chemicals, and of course, heavy water users as well.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:26):**  There can be a whole set of issues around soil degradation, around nutrient runoff,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:31):**  around pesticide toxicity for farm workers and local communities, and sometimes actually  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:35):**  quite high emissions associated with the operations, even if the trees themselves are storing carbon.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:41):**  So I think that's what's propelled us to look for these more regenerative alternatives.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:46):**  We have found them.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:47):**  I think probably the key principles of what we're seeing in these well-managed, I'd say  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:51):**  more regenerative orchards, first, a focus on cover crops.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:55):**  So trying to really move away from bare soil and deliberately planting cover crops in between  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:59):**  rows to serve a soil protection function, but also a fertility function too, and as  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:04):**  you can grow some of that nitrogen maybe for the tree crops.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:07):**  I think the second thing we're seeing is a stronger use of biological fertility rather  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:11):**  than synthetics.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:13):**  Whether that's compost, whether it's some more specialized liquid or biological fertility  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:17):**  products, but we've seen some really amazing results from compost and even biochar in our  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:21):**  orchard systems.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:22):**  And I think there's a lot more potential there, that sort of shift happens.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:25):**  Probably the third then is around integrated pest management, so really trying to reduce  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:29):**  pesticide use.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:31):**  And how do you do that?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:32):**  Well, it could be interplanting beneficial plants in pollinator habitats, like having  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:36):**  a healthy insect ecosystem, which is going to keep some of those undesirable bugs under  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:42):**  control.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:43):**  And so it's actually having more of a landscape approach and thinking what you do between  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:46):**  the rows around the borders.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:48):**  Does it also mean making the rows less of a monoculture as mixing them with other species?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:54):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:55):**  Or is that becomes difficult with harvesting and things like that?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:58):**  Is it mostly pistachios and that's it?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:01):**  Or do you see also there from the pest perspective or the pressure that it makes sense to have  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:06):**  certain oaks in the middle or something else?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:09):**  Pesticulture cropping is a great idea in theory, but I think there you quickly run up probably  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:12):**  the other major challenge facing all agricultural systems.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:16):**  I think in particular orchard systems at the moment, which is a lack of agricultural labor.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:20):**  This is the big challenge, whether you're in California, whether you're in Europe, in  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:23):**  Australia, finding people to work on the land is really, really hard.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:27):**  So I think we're seeing shift towards more mechanization.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:31):**  And so the successful systems will be those which are designed to be mechanized.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:35):**  There's those machines replacing people, hopefully machines replacing chemicals too to an extent  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:39):**  actually.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:40):**  So this is I think the really positive side of that, where you're doing more mechanical  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:42):**  weed control rather than spraying everything down with chemicals.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:45):**  I think it does put a little bit of a constraint on what you can do as intercropping.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:50):**  You can have a most beautiful one-hectare farm forestry system where one person devotes  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:55):**  their life to managing that.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:56):**  It can be incredibly productive, but it's very, very hard to scale.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:59):**  And so I think we still think there's a huge potential to do things within more intensive,  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:04):**  larger scale mechanized systems.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:06):**  But there you're focusing on what you plant within the rows, probably more in terms of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:09):**  cover crops rather than actually having like mixtures of different tree crops within the  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:12):**  rows.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:14):**  So the rows, let's say the perennial is relatively mono, but in between the annuals that you  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:18):**  plant or it could be perennial long grasses and things like that as well.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:22):**  But at least the machineries have to be able to enter.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:25):**  And also there I think there's an enormous development for lighter, much more selective.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:30):**  I mean, we can't imagine what we're going to see in 10 years there and what then potentially  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:33):**  is possible in terms of mixing because the machinery recognizes which tree it should  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:37):**  actually harvest and which one it shouldn't.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:39):**  Or I mean, there's a whole world there to discover, but most of it is not there yet.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:43):**  So you cannot really, you cannot sell a fund on that at the moment, of course.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:46):**  No, but I think actually that technology is starting to appear.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:50):**  We're seeing examples in different production systems, whether it's pheromone based systems  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:54):**  for trapping, suppressing harmful insects.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:58):**  We're seeing simple kind of camera assisted weeding machines which go between the rows  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:04):**  and know when it's a tree and know when it's a weed and can cut and not cut.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:09):**  So I think we will see increasing these sort of simple robotics you could call it or simple  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:13):**  technologically enabled systems for, again, as I said before, replacing chemicals with  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:17):**  more mechanical vegetation control, which I think will address some of the big issues  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:21):**  in chemical use.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:22):**  And I think probably the next step beyond that, I've talked about cover crops, we've  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:26):**  talked about biological fertility, integrated pest management.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:29):**  Probably the next step beyond that is then actually going fully organic, organic certified  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:32):**  systems.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:33):**  So that's going to be a big focus of what we do in Europe now.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:35):**  Again, huge market demand, massive premiums being paid at the moment.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:38):**  Organic almonds sell for literally twice the price as conventional.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:42):**  Organic olives are probably more like 25, 30% premium, but there's very strong premiums  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:45):**  to these crops.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:46):**  And I think if you can harness those practices, fully eliminate the synthetic fertilizers and  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:53):**  chemicals, then I think it opens up some really interesting marketing opportunities for growers  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:57):**  because consumers are willing to pay for them.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:59):**  And do you see this fund or this investment thesis as a sort of potential transition as  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:05):**  well?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:06):**  Let's say in 10 years, the robotics exist, or maybe there are slightly more hands available,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:09):**  or there's a lot more research showing that also more diverse on the perennial side, so  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:14):**  more diverse orchards are differently managed, but easily manageable with certain new technologies  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:20):**  and machinery.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:21):**  But you already anyway got rid of all the chemical fertilizer and all the chemical inputs.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:26):**  So these orchards can transition relatively easily to more diverse orchard itself over  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:32):**  time if that turned out to be possible.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:34):**  At the moment, it's way better to go from a very, let's say, input heavy, chemical heavy  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:38):**  orchard to an organic one, even though maybe from an ideal forestry perspective, that's  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:42):**  not the ideal yet, but that's the best we currently can do for the markets in terms  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:46):**  of the constraints, which are hands, labor, scale, et cetera.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:50):**  Do you see this as, this is not done.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:51):**  I'm imagining you can potentially in 10 years, we'll design an orchard even more diverse  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:56):**  and different if we get there with the technology and et cetera.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:59):**  Yeah, I think there's also like zooming out maybe a level, there's definitely a landscape  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:03):**  approach.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:04):**  Like whenever you look at a property in Spain or Portugal, there will be an area of maybe  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:08):**  highly productive ground, which is where you'd love to plant and grow your high value orchard  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:12):**  crops.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:13):**  But almost certainly there's going to be 10, 20, 50% maybe of non-productive ground, which  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:18):**  maybe isn't irrigated or is in hillsides.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:22):**  It's quite different and naturally where you can put the focus on biodiversity and conservation  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:27):**  and other goals.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:28):**  So there's also a big part of what we'll be doing is how do you make the best possible  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:31):**  use of the bits in between or the bits around the productive hectares and achieve the best  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:37):**  outcomes for biodiversity, but also carbon sequestration, but also some of those integrated  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:40):**  pest management benefits as well.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:42):**  If you have a healthy function ecosystem, that is going to have a positive knock on  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:45):**  effects on the orchards too, by controlling your pest and disease.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:49):**  Yeah, I think that landscape approach is very interesting.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:51):**  I mean, there are a few zooming out of that.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:55):**  I mean, we keep hearing it more and more maybe because we're in this little bubble, but definitely  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:59):**  Common Land is working on that, the WWF, or they just spun out actually the sustainable,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:04):**  what is the landscape finance lab.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:06):**  We had Paul Chatterton definitely do for a check-in and we've been focusing on that technology  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:09):**  question as well, or that question of what to plant where and why in a landscape and  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:14):**  what, how good software, et cetera, help with that.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:16):**  And we've been recording a series on that, which I'll put a link below as well, but there  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:20):**  are very few, but it doesn't, yeah, many places it makes sense to do certain things or it  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:24):**  doesn't, but it goes beyond the confinement of your, your farm.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:27):**  And you would love of course, that the full landscape is moving in a certain direction  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:30):**  and not moving backwards.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:31):**  So you get all kinds of runoff from your neighbors or drifts from all kinds of pesticides and  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:35):**  things you really don't want coming in.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:37):**  So you would like your neighbors to move in the same direction.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:40):**  Has that been difficult to find?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:41):**  Is that, is that, or what do you see in Spain and Portugal in terms of, let's say moving  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:45):**  together?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah, I think under there are some examples of great cooperatives working together, trying  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:49):**  to affect landscape change.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:51):**  You mentioned common lands, for example, the project which they're working in the Southeast  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:54):**  Spain, Alvalau is a really good example of that where they brought together dozens of  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:59):**  producers and farmers and, and, you know, implementing regenerative systems for organic  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:04):**  rain fed animals and pistachios.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:06):**  They've also built their own processing capabilities, their own brand, and I think it's working  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:10):**  very, very well.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:11):**  But I think there are examples of that.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:12):**  And I think also for us, like we, we also see within, even within a single property  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:16):**  boundary, you can actually achieve some of the same results.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:19):**  You know, so for example, we're looking at a property in the Southeast Spain at the moment,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:22):**  it's about a thousand hectares in total.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:25):**  Of that, about 500 hectares will be suitable for growing rain fed organic animals and pistachios.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:30):**  But the other 500 hectares is really non arable, non productive land, which is hill size, which  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:35):**  is, you know, could be riparian areas.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:37):**  And so how do you design and manage those 500 hectares within the property boundaries  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:41):**  to still have those positive impacts on biodiversity and carbon and some of the positive spillover  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:45):**  effects for productive land.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:46):**  So I think that's one of the advantages working those countries, which have a bit more scale  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:50):**  where properties are larger, is that you get some of the landscape benefits within your  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:55):**  own property.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:57):**  And then those 500, are you looking at, I don't know, are you supporting the farmer  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:01):**  and doing things there as well from the mushrooms to the honey to the grazing maybe, or is it  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:06):**  really okay?  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:07):**  Do you manage it for biodiversity and that's the impact?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:09):**  Or are you looking at smaller niche things or maybe you not specifically as a fund, but  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:14):**  the operators you work with to somehow use between brackets that other piece as well  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:19):**  for food production?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:20):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:21):**  So honey is one thing for sure.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:23):**  I think there's some potential there.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:25):**  We're looking at looking at actually aromatics and medicinal herbs, planting those sometimes  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:33):**  between rows or around orchards.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:34):**  We've seen some potential there.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:36):**  I think then carbon, as you're looking to restore forestry and shrub land for real  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:42):**  carbon benefits, I think there are some interesting projects like that.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:46):**  There's potential payments available from corporates who want to offset emissions and  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:51):**  there are some interesting opportunities for tree planting and to really, with these wood  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:55):**  having probably more heavily forested hillsides, if you go back a few hundred years ago, they've  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:59):**  been cleared and degraded and probably overgrazed and poorly grazed.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:04):**  So I think we do see some opportunities to reestablish forests there, not so much for  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:07):**  commercial purposes, but more for carbon biodiversity purposes.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:11):**  And so you're in the phase now of buying some of these properties this week and maybe when  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:16):**  this is out that that already happened.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:18):**  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:19):**  Where do you see this going?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:21):**  How long is the fund?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:22):**  How long is the approach?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:23):**  What are you looking at in terms of time?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:25):**  Because of course, with the tree crops and permanent orchard timing is always longer  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:29):**  than the arable ones.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:30):**  You're doing the organic grain you're doing in the US.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:33):**  What's your thinking on timing as it comes back time and time again in this podcast?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah, no, something we've thought a lot about because in many ways these are permanent assets.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:42):**  They keep going.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:43):**  They don't have a finite life.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:44):**  That's why I sell.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:45):**  Yeah, but I think we've also got feedback from investors who say that they quite like  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:49):**  the discipline of a fixed term fund because it gives them the option to get out if they  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:54):**  want.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:55):**  It provides managers with incentive, let's say, to really improve and make things work  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:00):**  up to a certain point.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:01):**  I think our funds so far have all been fixed term funds with a 10 to 14 year term.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:06):**  This new fund will be similar.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:07):**  It will have a 10 to 14 year term.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:09):**  So there will be an exit.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:11):**  Now what is that exit?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:12):**  I think it's not as if all the properties of farms or forests are broken up and sold.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:17):**  I think probably the most likely exit is-  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:18):**  Yeah, because I can imagine that that might be the fear of a farmer.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:21):**  Let's say I'm a farmer in central Spain or in Portugal.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:24):**  I partner with you.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:26):**  I buy the neighbor or the neighbors together.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:29):**  We start on this great journey and then in 10 years you come knocking and say, I'm sorry,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:33):**  but the time is up.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:35):**  We have to sell and who knows what's going to happen to that land.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:37):**  How do you prevent that from happening?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:39):**  Because I can imagine that would be a fear for some of the partners you work with.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:44):**  So I think it's consistent with what the most likely exit is, which is you're selling a  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:47):**  well-developed portfolio of farming and forestry assets, which are hopefully by then generating  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:52):**  a good cash yield.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:53):**  So we think there's going to be a lot of investor interest in that.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:57):**  And so it wouldn't make sense to break up those portfolios, to kick off the farmers,  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:01):**  because what's making it work is the presence of those farmers, those local partners on  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:04):**  the ground.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:05):**  So you'd be shooting yourselves in the foot to go down that road.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:08):**  So I think if things are working well, that's part of our job really is to help convince  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:12):**  people that these assets really do work.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:15):**  They are profitable, they're good for the environment and they can keep going for another  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:18):**  10, 20 years.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:20):**  And so most likely you keep the portfolio and you have another investors who come in  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:23):**  at that point, or maybe some of the investors in the existing fund are so happy with the  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:28):**  results that they want to stay in.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:29):**  And at that point it is possible to have almost a conversion to a more permanent vehicle where  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:34):**  you give investors the option to get out if they want to get out and those who want to  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:37):**  stay in can stay in.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:38):**  So I think it's keeping options open, but the key goal is building that portfolio well-managed,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:44):**  income generating assets, delivering high impact.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:47):**  And once you're at that point, I think there's a lot of different attractive options for  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:50):**  what you do next for the next 10 years and beyond.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:53):**  And do you see any route for the farmers to grow into that in a sense that they might  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:58):**  end up owning part of the land, all that land, or is that, are the assets so expensive that  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:03):**  that's prohibitive over the next 10, 14 years?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:06):**  Yeah, I think it's something we're discussing with some of the farmers you work with, you  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:08):**  know, having, they would have a first offer, first right of offer effectively on the property.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:12):**  So I think it can be a ladder to land ownership for them.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:15):**  I think we're also realistic too.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:17):**  You know, I think that, you know, farmers are businessmen and women and you know, that  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:21):**  there's a certain amount of their capital they want to invest in land, but they also  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:24):**  need capital for other things, you know, for machinery, for working capital, for.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:27):**  And just to be clear, that's when we get into the operating model, but that's not what you're  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:30):**  offering.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:31):**  You're offering capital for the land.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:32):**  Primarily, and the trees, you know, and the development of the land.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:35):**  So I think we found good operating teams, farmers and companies you work with, you know,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:42):**  they need capital for other purposes, you know, and that also be building processing  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:45):**  and going down the supply chain, you know, building markets as well.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:48):**  So actually while some may want a certain amount of land, not all want all their capital  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:53):**  in land, you know.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:54):**  So I think that there is a natural synergy between long-term investors, you know, who  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:58):**  have a lower cost of capital and are willing to invest in land and trees and biological  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:01):**  assets and then the operators who can come and operate that and designing the arrangements  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:06):**  the appropriate way.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:07):**  It's probably the, probably what, one of the aspects of this new fund where we are most  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:11):**  excited about as well is that operating model, you know, something we spent a lot of time  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:15):**  thinking through over the last 10 years and we've seen a lot of people try different operating  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:20):**  models.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:21):**  You know, on the one hand you have a sort of people who want to buy and operate, buy  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:24):**  land, hire people and try and capture all the profits.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:27):**  Which you've been doing in Australia basically.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:30):**  Which you've done to a certain extent in Australia.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:31):**  We build teams, we're running those crazy property sales.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:34):**  We know all the, what it takes, all the good and the bad and the challenges with that.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:38):**  And so in the theories that captures the full profits of the system, you know, for the investor.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:42):**  And then on the other end of the spectrum we've seen quite passive buying lease models  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:47):**  where a lot of money just into buying farmland, leasing out an annual one, two, three year  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:52):**  leases to farmers where there's really no input on what happens on the land.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:56):**  And that can be, we think a little bit too passive.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:58):**  What we find is, we think there's an opportunity for more of a partnership model with local  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:03):**  operators which is what we've been doing in Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:06):**  So we've been finding great local operators.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:08):**  They could be individual farmers.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:10):**  Quite often they're small, medium sized enterprises, companies.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:13):**  They might be specialists in organic olives or in regenerative almonds or pistachios.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:18):**  And they may have a certain amount of land which they own and manage.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:21):**  They may have invested in processing and they may be developing brands and marketing capabilities  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:25):**  downstream.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:27):**  They want to grow, they want to scale.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:28):**  They don't have the capital to invest in that land.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:30):**  Neither do they necessarily want to invest in that land because their cost of capital  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:33):**  is higher.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:34):**  Or a private equity of business costs of capital.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:36):**  So there's a natural synergy where we, our fund can come in, work with these operators  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:41):**  to find the right kind of land.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:42):**  We invest in it.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:43):**  We provide capital for planting new trees, for organic conversion, whatever is happening  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:48):**  on develop the land.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:49):**  And then the operators come in and operate day to day.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:52):**  They're in charge, they're responsible.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:54):**  But we both fund the operating expenses.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:56):**  So we're sharing operating expenses as well.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:58):**  And then we're sharing revenue or profit between the investor and the operator.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:01):**  So it's sort of a bespoke hybrid model we developed.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:06):**  But it's got a very good reception among some of these great innovative, I'd say, ecological  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:10):**  operators in Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:12):**  And yeah, we're quite excited about that.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:13):**  We think it's a real way we can scale.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:14):**  And the bigger picture I think is really understanding what's the role of capital.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:20):**  And capital not maybe overstepping its boundaries.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:22):**  We see some investors maybe a little bit too greedy because they see the numbers in the  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:26):**  spreadsheet and they think, oh, why don't I capture the full returns from organic animals  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:30):**  or organic olives and I'll just hire people and capture all those profits.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:34):**  But the reality is quite different.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:35):**  It looks good in the spreadsheet, but as you try and do it, often it doesn't work.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:39):**  And that's partly because you need the local operators, the most important person.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:43):**  And that person must have aligned incentives.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:46):**  And if they're just an employee, if they're just a hired gun, then you don't always get  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:51):**  the best attention and you don't always get the right alignment.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:55):**  So we think these operating partnerships are the way to go because you're getting the best  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:58):**  teams that have the local knowledge equities and you're aligning your incentives with those  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:02):**  the investors will own.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:05):**  And how did you find them in Spain and Portugal?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:08):**  Is that going around?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:09):**  Is that having a lot of coffees?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:11):**  Is that getting in a car and visiting many of these?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:14):**  How did you how do you build that up?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:15):**  Yeah, a lot of coffee.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:16):**  Good to me in Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:17):**  Lots of good wine too.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:18):**  So it makes it quite an enjoyable experience.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:21):**  Yeah, so it's networking referrals.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:24):**  We've hired an agronomist in Portugal.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:26):**  Fijaro Zero has joined our team, he's in Lisbon.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:29):**  So he's got an amazing network in Portugal already and in Spain too.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:33):**  And then we've been doing our own work.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:34):**  And then we've come in through networks, whether it's regenerative agriculture networks or maybe  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:38):**  some organic olive oil producer networks or different entry points, let's say, to start  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:43):**  talking to people and explain what we do.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:45):**  Yeah, and we found probably six or seven different groups now that sort of fit the bill.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:48):**  And I think we'll find more as we go along.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:51):**  Is that a model that you could see growing beyond that?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:55):**  Why do you see maybe it's a difficult question, but why you see others not applying that?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:59):**  And maybe you meant the greedy part.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:01):**  But I think then people notice very quickly that the spreadsheet is very different from  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:04):**  reality.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:05):**  And do they then abandon that?  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:07):**  Or do you see that as a risk as well?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:09):**  Many questions.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:10):**  Let's say, do you see this going beyond Spain and Portugal, and others copying this or also  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:14):**  applying this method?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:15):**  Because of course, it's not a it's not a there's no patent on it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:18):**  But it makes a lot of sense, because it's so context specific.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah, so I think the first question, absolutely, we see it going beyond Spain and Portugal,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:25):**  we're actually working on a similar strategy in the US at the moment, the west coast of  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:31):**  the US looking at California, Washington, Oregon area, where we see some opportunities  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:35):**  there around permanent specialty crops, especially organic certified.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:39):**  And we have also found some great local operators there.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:42):**  And we see a similar potential, you know, for investors to come in and provide capital  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:46):**  for land acquisition and tree establishment and organic conversion and we can enter into  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:51):**  probably more like long term leases, but very flexible terms where the investor is really  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:55):**  sharing some of that risk with the farmer, and then sharing some of the upside to you  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:59):**  know, post organic conversion, post conversion to more general systems.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:02):**  So I think there's definitely potential all over the world, wherever agriculture is practiced  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:06):**  in a commercial way.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:08):**  Risk of other copying?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:09):**  Well, we hope everyone does copy.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:10):**  I think you know, I think it's a good model.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:11):**  So I think it's, I think it's what the sector needs, you know, is capital playing its right  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:16):**  full role, you know, not getting too greedy, not overstepping its bounds, you know, knowing  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:20):**  when to leave the local operators really much in charge in the driving seat, and being supportive  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:24):**  of those local operators who it all comes back to those farmers, foresters who have  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:28):**  that ecological knowledge and local knowledge, you know, and how do we empower them and support  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:32):**  them and help them help them grow.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:34):**  So yeah, I hope more people, you know, try this approaches.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:37):**  And because we have had, I think, a wave of investments previously, I don't remember exactly  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:42):**  when, but it was a wave of interest in farmland and forestry, and many institutional investors  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:46):**  wouldn't say got burned, but there was a lot of discussion on the non ecological approaches,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:50):**  the land grabbing land titles, and many, maybe they took a step back and said, Okay, for  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:56):**  now, I won't touch these sectors you see now, or you mentioned, there's definitely a new  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:00):**  interest.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:01):**  Do you have to explain very often that this is very fundamentally different than some  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:05):**  of the let's buy and build an enormous plantation somewhere very far away, and let's operate  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:09):**  it and bring in everything?  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:10):**  Like, is that stigma still sort of there?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:12):**  Or what do you see in terms in the institutional investors that obviously, very different from  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:17):**  a family that's investing, they have to go through all kinds of hoops, jump through everything  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:20):**  and cover many things and take many boxes, rightfully so, because they're investing our  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:24):**  pension money.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:25):**  But do you see that it's still difficult to sell quote unquote, agriculture, land and  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:30):**  forestry?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:31):**  Or is it is that has that changed over the last years?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:33):**  Yeah, well, I think the local context is very important, you know, so we wouldn't attempt  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:38):**  our model in Sub Saharan Africa, for example, you know, or many parts of the emerging world,  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:43):**  because I think, you know, in countries where 75% of people earn their livelihoods from  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:48):**  agriculture from the land, you know, the idea of sort of coming in and trying to push people  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:52):**  off land and build up these giant holdings, I think it is very problematic, actually.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:56):**  You know, I think we're operating in Europe and North America and Australia, where actually  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:00):**  the opposite is the case where people have left the land and land has been almost abandoned  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:04):**  and neglected.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:05):**  And everyone's moved to the towns and the cities and the average age of farmers is 60  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:09):**  plus.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:10):**  So there's actually been this great exodus, you know, and so there I think, you know,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:14):**  I think there are opportunities to come in for capital to play this sort of longer term,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:19):**  almost capitalistic role of pushing some of these systems in a better direction and helping  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:23):**  these more innovative, often younger farmers expand.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:25):**  You know, that's the other thing, the people, the farmers who work in America, for example,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:29):**  the average age is probably more like mid 30s.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:30):**  You know, so we're working at farmers who are significantly lower than the average,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:35):**  maybe half.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:37):**  And their challenge, how do they get access to land?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:38):**  Because land is expensive.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:39):**  It's, you know, held up, tied up in trust and different kinds of structures.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:43):**  A lot of it has been leased or has been, it's not been owner occupied anyway, but it's still  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:48):**  very hard for them to get that access so we can help.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:51):**  So I think it's locally contextually appropriate.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:54):**  And I think in those economies where the center of attention and most jobs have shifted away  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:59):**  from agriculture, away from rural areas.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:01):**  And I think we feel much more comfortable about playing that role of being a catalytic  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:06):**  investor.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:07):**  It's very interesting that the land ownership discussion, which comes back time and time  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:11):**  again and then the reality hits in, of course, that many young farmers that want to move  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:15):**  into the space simply cannot get access to land unless you're born into it or you have  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:19):**  a very interesting bank account or you borrow a lot of money and you're pushed into, if  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:23):**  you even can, pushed into an agriculture system that has to serve that money you borrowed  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:28):**  from a bank against terms that are not very flexible as the land could offer.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:32):**  So it's a very, it's an interesting philosophical discussion about land ownership and should  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:36):**  that be privatized or not, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:38):**  But it's also a very practical one that many who want to farm don't have access to enough  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:42):**  land to farm or even any land to farm and are stuck in the system and could probably  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:47):**  farm for the next 30, 40 years and provide a lot of very interesting food to us if they  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:51):**  could get access to that.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:53):**  So it's one to keep coming back to and check reality with, obviously.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:59):**  And some questions I always like to ask, but I didn't get five years ago because it was  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:03):**  a very different podcast.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:04):**  Where are you contrarian?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:05):**  What do you believe to be true about regen ag and forestry?  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:08):**  Let's add it here as well that others don't believe to be true.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:10):**  This is definitely inspired by John Kempf, who does a very interesting, very deep podcast  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:15):**  on soil and everything.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:16):**  But where are you contrarian in terms of, I mean, you already mentioned the focus on  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:19):**  orchard is you said it's been a bit neglected in the space, but where else if you go to  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:24):**  conferences, which I know you do a lot or did a lot now virtually, where do you see  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:28):**  yourself that you think fundamentally different than many in the space?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:31):**  Yeah, I would say one is a belief that these regenerative management systems, which have  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:38):**  these positive environmental impacts, can be consistent with your highly commercial  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:42):**  and also scalable operations.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:46):**  You know that it is an all one hectare farm forestry.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:49):**  You can have large scale commercial operations, which are producing good volumes of healthy  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:54):**  nutritious food or good quality timber from a forest and are still managed in these ecological  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:59):**  ways.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:00):**  And not only is it possible, it's probably a necessity because the realities are, as  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:03):**  I said, labor is scarce.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:05):**  People don't want to work on the lands.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:06):**  We need to find these more, you need to find efficient ways to manage land still.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:11):**  So we're not trying to go back in time, we're really trying to go forward in time.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:14):**  These are the modern versions of ecological systems.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:17):**  I mean, just one example of that, we see in the olive space, there's been a whole shift  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:23):**  ongoing in Spain and Portugal away from the more traditional olive orchards, where you  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:28):**  have very low tree densities, maybe unirrigated, low input, but also actually very expensive  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:34):**  to manage and often quite unprofitable because you rely on actually hand pruning and actually  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:39):**  your manual harvesting or mechanized shakers.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:42):**  And it's actually quite inefficient and quite unprofitable.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:46):**  A shift towards more, called super high density systems, where you're planting olive trees  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:51):**  as you in rows, which are density, almost more like hedgerows.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:54):**  And they developed these machines that come right over the top and harvest from the bushes  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:59):**  directly and can take those olives, harvest them quickly, get them to processing facilities  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:04):**  quickly and turn them into olive oil quickly too.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:06):**  And that, on the face, you think super high density doesn't sound very nice.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:10):**  You think intensive, you think-  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:11):**  Sounds industrial.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, sounds industrial.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:13):**  This must be bad.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:14):**  But if you actually dig in, you see that, so first in terms of olive oil quality, there's  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:18):**  been a huge increase in the quality of olive oil, the proportion of extra virgin olive  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:22):**  oil, for example, with low acidity in Portugal over the last 10 years.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:25):**  And that's because of the shift from these traditional to super high density systems.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:29):**  The reason being that you can get this much quicker harvest and you can get the olives  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:33):**  through the processing within 24 hours.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:34):**  And that's really the key factor of olive oil quality is actually just the efficiency.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:39):**  And speed from tree to mill, basically, that's the-  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:44):**  Yeah, from ripeness to harvesting to mill to processing.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:47):**  If you can do all that within 24 hours, you will get a high quality olive oil.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:51):**  So we're actually seeing higher quality oils coming out of the systems.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:54):**  Second in terms of the impacts, there have been some issues with night harvesting, having  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:58):**  a detrimental impact on nesting birds.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:01):**  I think that needs to go away.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:02):**  But once you take that away, there's been some very interesting research on the carbon  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:06):**  benefits of super high density olives, where actually these systems store a huge amount  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:10):**  more carbon per hectare than the more traditional systems.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:14):**  Partly getting a lot more biomass growth, getting a lot more pruning and residues, and  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:17):**  they are reincorporated into the ground, either directly or through composting.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:21):**  And you can get some quite spectacular increases in soil as well as above ground carbon.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:25):**  So in terms of for carbon and climate, these intensive orchards are actually far superior.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:30):**  And then I think the third, we are seeing some operators in Spain and Portugal who are  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:33):**  able to manage the orchards in fully organic ways.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:36):**  So they take out all the synthetic fertilizers and all the pesticides and are achieving very  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:41):**  high organic yields.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:42):**  So for us, that's a kind of a holy grail where you have an intensive, highly productive,  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:46):**  high yielding system, managed organically, very, very good for carbon and very good for  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:51):**  quality, let's say, of products.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:53):**  So I think that's what we've got to keep looking for, these modern regenerative ag  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:58):**  systems, not going back in time to what it was 100 years ago.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:02):**  So that's one thing that we believe in.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:03):**  I think we think that that's where, yeah, what's the direction of travel we need to  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:07):**  go in.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:08):**  And in terms of quality, you mentioned the Evo, obviously, and in terms of, say, the  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:12):**  nutrient density or the measurement of the quality of the olive oil, what have you seen  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:16):**  there or is that still very early?  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:18):**  Because many say older trees give well managed, obviously, give X, Y, Z and compared to younger  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:23):**  ones or younger systems.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:25):**  Do you see there or is that simply, let's say, quality is Evo and that's what we're  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:29):**  looking at?  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:31):**  And some of the best olive oil in the world will come from these more traditional systems.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:35):**  So what we see is just huge variety in quality.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:38):**  So you have some extraordinary high quality olive oil that's coming from some of these  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:41):**  orchards, but also a lot of quite poor olive oil too.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:44):**  So what these more modern systems do is...  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:46):**  And these orchards are being abandoned at the moment, right?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:49):**  In many cases, huge issues with disease, Xylallofasciatiosis, actually attacking traditional orchards more.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:56):**  How is the disease pressure then on these high intensive ones?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:59):**  As the trees are, I mean, for my non extreme knowledge, like the trees are closer to each  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:03):**  other, so one gets sick, everything gets sick or is that too easy or they use different  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:07):**  varieties or stronger trees or something?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:10):**  Well, I think a lot of it is the health of the tree.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:12):**  So a healthy tree is more resistant to pests and diseases.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:16):**  And if you are supplying the right fertility, the trees are getting the right amount of  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:21):**  water and they're being pruned in the right way, then yeah, you can have quite healthy,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:24):**  vigorous trees.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:25):**  So that's probably the greatest protection you can get for some of these pests and diseases  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:29):**  and things like the Xylallofasciatiosis, this new disease has been coming in and sweeping  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:32):**  through all of orchards in Italy, has been primarily affecting unfortunately old traditional  
**[0:43:37-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:37):**  orchards.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:38):**  It's been in Puglia, that's where the problem has been, not so much the actually more modern,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:41):**  well run, let's say, intensive orchards.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:43):**  So that's just in terms of contrarianism, just we don't want to forsake the efficiencies  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:47):**  by going regenerative and we think it is possible.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:49):**  I think the other one is, again, probably the operating model that we talked about before,  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:52):**  like how do we find, how do we work with the best possible operators on the ground and  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:56):**  design the right structures which are going to bring them on board and incentivize them  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:01):**  and align their incentives with those of our investors.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:03):**  That's something we think is really, really important and getting away from that spreadsheet  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:06):**  agriculture to these partnerships on the ground, that's another, I think, big, big focus here  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:12):**  for us at the moment.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:14):**  And maybe just a final one, if you want one more, I'd say, actually investing in Europe,  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:18):**  in itself the idea of investing in natural assets in Europe is a bit contrarian because  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:25):**  most of the investments going to the US or Australia, Latin America, people think Europe  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:29):**  is fragmented or old or expensive and it can be all those things, but we think there's  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:34):**  also some really interesting opportunities, both in forestry in certain countries and  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:38):**  then in Spain and Portugal and the orchard side.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:40):**  So yeah, I think you get some good appropriate returns with all the low risk that comes from  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:46):**  investing in the Eurozone as well.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:49):**  And if you could change one thing, so you had a magic wand that gave you magic power  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:53):**  in the food and agriculture or the forestry space or in general, it could be global consciousness  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:57):**  or like I keep saying better taste or et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:01):**  What would you do if you had that magic power over overnight and you could only one, in  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:05):**  this case, only one, only one thing could be changed in the impact investing or agriculture  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:10):**  and forestry space?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:11):**  I still think a lot more work is needed to allow us to generate and sell carbon offsets,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:18):**  you know, from land based projects, particularly, strange enough, in places like Europe where  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:23):**  you can get into funny issues around double accounting and what people can trade and use.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:28):**  It's ironically easier for corporates to buy like a credit somewhere or EDD forestry project  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:34):**  in Asia or South America.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:36):**  It is actually to invest in forestry or agriculture projects in Europe, you know, because of the  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:41):**  way carbon accounting rules are set up.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:42):**  So I think there's a lack of clarity there and I think you're having a clear, consistent  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:47):**  set of rules around what qualifies as stored carbon and how producers can get compensated  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:54):**  and rewarded for doing that, for increasing that.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:56):**  I really think that could be a massive booster of some of these systems.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:01):**  We've all been talking about it for 10 years, but we're still not quite there.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:05):**  So hopefully the next 10 years, some of those schemes will get clarified and come more into  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:09):**  view and be more practical for producers on the ground.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:12):**  Yeah, I think there's a lot of talk and I hope some of that will be transferred into  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:18):**  practical tools for the operators and farmers on the ground and the people partnering with  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:22):**  them like yourself.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:23):**  And not necessarily, I see a company popping up probably every other week that promises  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:27):**  all kinds of soil carbon credits and tree credits, et cetera.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:31):**  But I also get the feeling that a lot of cowboys getting in because they see the excitement  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:35):**  for the word soil carbon and tree carbon in the same sentence.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:39):**  So it's going to be a rough ride, I think, for over the next years, because a lot of  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:42):**  these things are looking amazing on Spreadsheet and very easy on Spreadsheet.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:46):**  And when it comes down to actually verifying, measuring and selling these things and making  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:51):**  sure they keep they stay in the ground and in the tree, it's the reality is slightly  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:56):**  different and more difficult and not absolutely necessary.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:59):**  And we have to figure it out, but it's not so easy.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:02):**  So let's see that we will keep following that, obviously, with the podcast.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:04):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:06):**  We need clarity and we need bigger markets there and more flow because not enough flows  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:10):**  to the to the operators and the farmers and the landowners that are doing this work in  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:14):**  many cases, like you said, for decades.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:16):**  And maybe even have to be compensated for that.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:18):**  And not the ones that have been, let's say, the free rider problem is an issue here.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:22):**  The ones that have been performing the worst and are now planting the trees might get the  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:26):**  biggest the biggest payout, which is not really what we want.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:29):**  I think we want to also support the ones that have been on this for many decades.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:33):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:34):**  So I don't want to keep any more of your time.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:37):**  I want to be conscious of it as well.

**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:07):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:12):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.

**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:22):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:24):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:25):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:26):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:33):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:35):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:40):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:45):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:50):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:52):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:57):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:00):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:05):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:51:06-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:08):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:11):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:16):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

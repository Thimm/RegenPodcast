**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:14):**  Get ready, because this is a long and deep one.

**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:20):**  Today we're joined by potentially the laziest farmer in the UK.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:24):**  And we go deep into why conventional farming in the UK has failed and is failing and what  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:29):**  can be done differently.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:31):**  Why animal impact is so crucial and how you can build a very, very successful business  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:36):**  by farming with nature, looking very carefully at margins, costs, input, and most importantly,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:42):**  creating a guaranteed market and why we should all focus on ex-vegans as our target market.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:48):**  Join me and learn about the fascinating journey of farmer Matt.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:55):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:59):**  Living as if the planet mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:03):**  and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:08):**  people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:14):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:16):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:20):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:24):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more attention  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:29):**  to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome to another episode today with Matt Chatfield, the founder of the Cornwall project.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:01):**  We're going to unpack a lot on sheep and connections to chefs on how to build a positive impact  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:07):**  on the land in the UK.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:08):**  And I'm very, very excited to have Matt on the show.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:11):**  So welcome, Matt.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:12):**  Yeah, hello.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:13):**  Yeah, nice to be here.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:15):**  And we got introduced recently through Ophelia.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:17):**  So shout out to you to that.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:19):**  Obviously, anybody actually that has great guests for the show, always feel free to reach  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:22):**  out because it's the best way we we get people on.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:26):**  But let's start with your with your story.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:28):**  How did you I mean, not end up in farm because you actually grew up in farming, but you came  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:32):**  back to it.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:33):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:34):**  What made you go away, first of all, and then come back to it?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:36):**  Because I think many people quote unquote, escape and don't come back anymore.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:40):**  But you decided to actually do.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:42):**  Yeah, so I mean, my whole thing was I was born in Cornwall.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:47):**  And I did start something called the Cornwall project.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:49):**  But we actually have a small home in Cornwall, but we have a family farm in Devon.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:55):**  It's just across the border from Cornwall.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:58):**  So it's very close.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:00):**  And essentially, we've actually farmed the same land for at least 400 years.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:05):**  So it's only a small farm, but we were basically part of a very big estate for and incredibly  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:11):**  for 360 years, my family actually farmed on behalf of the estate.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:15):**  I think we were called yeoman.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:17):**  So all my family are basically buried in the same graveyard and very humble people.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:21):**  But I'm one of the graveyard's actually says yeoman and I think he was born that was the  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:25):**  date of the Messiah and he was born in 1770.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:30):**  And then so basically would have been sort of very much mixed farming for a lot of that  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:34):**  time.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:35):**  And as I do what I'm doing now, I'm actually going to go through the history and I can  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:38):**  see what my folks basically did 400, 300, 200 years ago, which is quite incredible.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:43):**  But basically, we're in a very, very wet part of the world.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:46):**  We're in between a place called Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:49):**  So the weather comes up Atlantic, goes up over Bodmin Moor and then dumps all the rain  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:53):**  on us before heading off.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:56):**  So it would have been a very wet farm.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:58):**  And I imagine for all that time, it would be very much mixed farming.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:01):**  So the land that we've actually got is only 80 acres.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:05):**  And so my family would have farmed that and it would be very much sort of mixed farming,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:10):**  you know, sort of vegetables, sheep, cattle, you know, sort of various things.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:14):**  But then my granddad was very much part of that generation of after the second world  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:18):**  war was like feed the nation.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:21):**  And he...  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:22):**  End of world.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:24):**  Feed everybody.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:25):**  It's very much sort of UK focused.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:26):**  I feel, you know, I'll try to have a world view on things.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:31):**  But very much in this country, it was I think they realized that during the war, you know,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:34):**  we were like 20%, you know, 20% of our own population.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:39):**  And so there was the advent of the sunny windows also, they built lots of like record, they  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:44):**  realized with the same chemicals they could make nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:48):**  So my granddad was basically encouraged by the government.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:50):**  And I was doing research to realize that he was basically forced, like he didn't do the  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:54):**  things the government wanted to do.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:55):**  Like, you know, that potentially could be ousted from the farming.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:59):**  So obviously, he was all working on a big estate, but he basically ploughed all the  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:04):**  land, planted dry grass, drained all the land, so all the water went off the fields and sort  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:10):**  of whatever would have taken down some hedgerows.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:12):**  But he was basically the first person introduced to Friesian cow into like the southwest of  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:18):**  England.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:19):**  So for that time, incredibly progressive farmer, incredibly hard working man.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:24):**  And he basically yeah, and it's only now, I mean, I how hard he must have worked to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:29):**  try and have a herd of basically 40 Friesian cows on an 80 acre farm in our part of the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:33):**  world.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:34):**  You know, it was quite incredible.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:35):**  But anyway, about 40 years ago, this UK had inheritance tax came in, which basically meant  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:42):**  all these big estates were ripped apart, basically, and a lot were struggling and had to sell.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:46):**  So my granddad had the opportunity after 360 years of farming to buy the land.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:51):**  And it was a huge thing.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:52):**  When I'm 49, but I you know, I was only nine at the time, but it was just such a huge thing  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:57):**  was happening.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:58):**  But obviously, he then bought the land.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:01):**  But just after he bought it, like that's when things really started happening for the Danish.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:05):**  And I don't want to go to like, give my views on Brexit and the European Union, but there  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:09):**  are a lot of pressures at the same time hitting farming, basically, particularly dairy farming,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:13):**  and the supermarkets, you know, coaches, all sorts of things happening.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:17):**  So growing up, my granddad just never encouraged us to farm.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:21):**  I'd loved it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:22):**  I wanted to farm.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:23):**  My mom actually started a dairy farm, I used to help her.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:26):**  But it was just never an option.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:27):**  Because I think my granddad could see the writing on the wall for small farmers.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:30):**  This is before farmers markets and these sorts of things.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:33):**  So the last thing in the world he wanted us to do was farm.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:37):**  So go as far away as possible.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:39):**  So I did and I basically went off and was always sort of grew up very much in the environment.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:45):**  I used to go fishing on my own all the time.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:47):**  I basically, you know, always, you know, quite good for, you know, the popular chap at school  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:52):**  and stuff.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:53):**  But you know, I just always loved my own company with my dog and I'd be down at the river trying  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:56):**  to catch salmon actually.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:57):**  It just gave me a huge love for the environment.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:00):**  So I went off into an environmental studies at college.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:04):**  And then I ended up going into publishing.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:06):**  So not using my environmental background.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:09):**  And then I always sort of say I got very hedonistic basically in the UK publishing like now, nobody  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:16):**  really drinks at lunchtime.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:17):**  But like 20, 30 years ago they did.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:18):**  So basically I went to London for 10 years.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:19):**  I worked fairly hard, but drunk a lot, had a lot of fun.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:20):**  And you know, sort of forgot my farmer background.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:21):**  But then my granddad actually got very ill.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:22):**  And it's one of my biggest regrets in life actually is he got a stroke.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:23):**  And I was like, I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:24):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:25):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:26):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:27):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:28):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:29):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:30):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:31):**  And then my granddad actually got very ill and it's one of my biggest regrets in life  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:36):**  actually is he got very unwell and I just didn't take it that seriously.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:40):**  And I went and saw him a couple of times and then he died.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:42):**  And it was, you know, and then it was just a hard time.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:46):**  And I just realized, you know, I felt very guilty.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:49):**  And then six years later, my nan who you're very, very close to, she became very unwell.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:55):**  So I actually moved back to Devon.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:57):**  You felt very bad because of course on the personal side, but also because you sort of  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:01):**  lost that because you said, then I did research and understand how hard he must have worked  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:06):**  for that super crucial period in the history of the countryside and farming.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:12):**  You had a direct access, but you maybe didn't mean there were probably also books in that  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:16):**  story.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:17):**  There was a lot there that you maybe forgot or pushed in a corner.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:21):**  You sort of saw a man who was even when he passed away, you know, he was a very physically  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:25):**  strong man, mentally very strong, but he'd given his body, he basically had one knee  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:31):**  replaced with his waist with another knee replaced.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:33):**  So he'd given his body for farming and he always liked it.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:37):**  It was actually quite scary thinking if he can't do it, like how could anyone else ever  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:41):**  do it?  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:42):**  Like no one could work harder than him.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:43):**  But I still say one memory and sometimes I cry when I say this, but our farm is basically  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:50):**  a hundred meters from the graveyards.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:51):**  And when he passed away, I went up there about 5 a.m.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:55):**  I had my heart, you know, when I saw his coffin, cried my eyes out.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:58):**  And I was like, all he ever did really was he would farm, milk cows, spend a lot of time  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:04):**  making sure the drainage ditches were clear so that all the water could come off and go  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:08):**  in the wood.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:09):**  And he then used to go once a week to Hosley Market, which is just a very small town.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:13):**  You know, so every Wednesday he'd go there and that was his life.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:16):**  But then when he died, I was one of the coffin bearers, so we had to walk up.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:21):**  I'd done my crying really and I thought I'm just going to be, you know, put up my face.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:26):**  And I walked up and literally there were like 2000 people waiting.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:29):**  It was just insane.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:30):**  And it was like, it was like this man, such a simple life, but was so well respected.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:38):**  And it was, that was that just hit me like, you know, just to, you know, I always laugh  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:43):**  at myself now because I've got to do all sorts of things, but I've probably about 20 people  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:48):**  turned up to my funeral.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:49):**  It's just incredible.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:50):**  What can we learn about that?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:52):**  I think there's something very deep that we don't understand on stewarding the land.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:58):**  I think stewarding might be the right word.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:59):**  It might be fancy words that I know, but like that, that even of course he was forced in  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:04):**  a system and blocked in a system and he did like probably the max he could possibly do  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:09):**  under the conditions and saw the writing on the wall, but there was no chance to change  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:14):**  or there was a chance to change, but you move with the system.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:20):**  If he was younger or if we had a bigger farm, the only way you could change, it seems like  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:24):**  dirty water systems.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:25):**  You know, it's all good stuff, you know, but you had to basically collect all the waste  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:30):**  in the cattle.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:31):**  You had to store it.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:32):**  And this would have cost tens of thousands of pounds.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:35):**  So it was a time when even the small dairy farm won out business, all very ambitious  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:38):**  younger people started buying up farms.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:40):**  You know, so that's, there was the beginning of, you know, and I think intensification  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:44):**  of, if he'd been a younger man, he would have done it.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:47):**  You know, like if he'd been the next generation, he wouldn't, we probably have 800 cows all  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:51):**  feeding inside.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:52):**  Or if he would be young now, it would be on YouTube learning about the latest grazing  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:57):**  stuff.  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:58):**  I don't think he ever would have gone on YouTube.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:00):**  I do think that if he was 20 now, maybe, I mean, he would be learning.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:04):**  I mean, I think that's that entrepreneurial spirit is that you probably would have pushed  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:10):**  the boundaries now.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:11):**  The bit I find really interesting is, because I've now come along, probably talk more about  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:17):**  it, but I'm totally changing the way, you know, I've gone from what he's done.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:21):**  I'm now I'm cracking all that and changing it.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:24):**  But I think his name is Gang, well after John Knight was his name, but his, his, his, his  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:31):**  dad and his name are both Gang, as I know him as like Gang.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:35):**  But they must have, his granddad must have, his dad must have farmed in a way that was  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:40):**  just with nature, you know, like it would have been the way I'm trying to do it now.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:43):**  They must have had such debates about, you know, when he brought in the ditches and the  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:48):**  cow, the different cow breeds and must have been as big as now, like huge.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:53):**  The discussion would have been exactly similar.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:56):**  But the difference is, is that I'm sure they would have had arguments, but they would have  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:02):**  plowed the land.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:03):**  They would have planted the rye grass, they would have put the chemical fertilizer and  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:06):**  it must have exploded.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:07):**  It must have seen like a miracle.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:09):**  It must have just seemed like, you know, it just would have, you know, like, so I think  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:15):**  there's any discussion.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:16):**  Yeah, probably would have like, look, it works.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:18):**  I guarantee within one year, just be like, and all the neighbors must have been like,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:22):**  you know, like, it's just like, so it's a trap because if you don't do it, and you may  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:27):**  all your neighbors do and they double or whatever the X is in that, like the multiplier is their  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:34):**  production and suddenly you see new roofs on their houses and all of that new cars and  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:38):**  stuff like that.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:41):**  The pressure to go on with that, even though maybe deep down, you know, you see some effects  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:46):**  that in a couple of years start to like, you have to keep adding more and more, but it's  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:49):**  a, it's a mousetrap.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:50):**  It keeps going faster and faster.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:52):**  Like that wheel that's spinning.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:54):**  And that's the tricky part.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:55):**  Like how do we get off that?  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:57):**  Because if you don't do it, somebody else does and you still have the same commodity  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:59):**  contract.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:01):**  You're stuck.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:03):**  But there's some, I think James Rebank, I don't know if you know, he's a fantastic guy  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:07):**  who I do follow a lot.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:08):**  And his book, you know, he, you know, these, I didn't read it yet.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:12):**  I really have to, it keeps coming up.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:14):**  For me it's brilliant because it's, he sort of says his granddad, his dad was a bit like  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:18):**  my granddad where, you know, he did the transformation, but his granddad before would literally sit  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:22):**  there and watch the farm and watch wildlife and watch the animals for like two, three  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:26):**  hours a day.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:27):**  And like, cause I do that.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:28):**  He actually said that's, that should be classed as working.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:31):**  My mum's of a generation where she, she's like work, work, work, work.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:35):**  And she would sort of say, where are you at the moment?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:38):**  I said, I'm working in the wood.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:39):**  She'll say, are you sitting on a chair?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:40):**  And I say, yes, I am.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:41):**  But it is that.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:42):**  Thinking is working.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:43):**  I think it is.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:44):**  I really do think, I mean, we'll probably talk a bit.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:48):**  I hope that we can move farming or managing the land from this extremely physical, like  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:55):**  you mentioned with your, your grandfather, like that work that you need to work 10, 12  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:00):**  hours a day physically constantly to partly, it's never going to be non-physical.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:05):**  I, of course I completely understand that, but it's also much more, let's say knowledge  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:08):**  and it's very knowledge intensive, but that farmers have more time to use all that knowledge  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:12):**  and all the observations that are happening and to actually do something with it, which  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:15):**  means you cannot be running around 12 hours a day because then you don't have the time  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:19):**  to actually observe or to process the observing.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:22):**  You do the observing, but you don't process.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:24):**  So I think that down, not even downtime, that makes it sound very bad, but like observing,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:29):**  thinking hands off and seeing, I mean, of course we all say, Oh, let nature do the work,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:34):**  et cetera, et cetera, but it does allow you to have more thinking time.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:38):**  I know I ought to go back to answer your question, but I'm sure we'll come back to it.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:43):**  Because the way I've created the market and the guaranteed market, I would say this, there's  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:47):**  probably not a farm.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:48):**  Mentioning that just like this, we're going to unpack that.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:50):**  There's no word.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:51):**  The guaranteed market is an interesting thing to unpack.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:53):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:55):**  I probably spend more time sitting on my ass watching than any other farm in the UK because  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:00):**  I've got a guaranteed profit from what I do.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:02):**  You know, I know I'm going to make money.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:04):**  I already see a title for this interview.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:06):**  The laziest farmer of the UK.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:07):**  We need to do a bit of clickbait otherwise people are going to click on it.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:11):**  I always say that I'm probably too lazy and not clever enough to farm against nature.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:18):**  I need it on my side.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:19):**  I think, and I always say, when you've got ruminants, you're farming with nature.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:22):**  As soon as you remove ruminants, nature just wants to try and kick your ass.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:26):**  So I'm like, you know, rather than fight nature, I'm like, you know, let's just get it on my  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:31):**  side.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:32):**  So yeah, I would possibly say that's a very, I love that quote.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:36):**  I'm too lazy to farm against nature.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:38):**  But let's, okay, let's start unpacking the market piece a bit.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:42):**  If I can make a way back to, so my nan died, absolutely loved her a bit.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:48):**  Spent about six months with her at the end, it wasn't a particularly nice six months,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:51):**  but I then started really reflecting on my guilt really, what I felt about my granddad  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:56):**  and also like, how could I try and, I basically decided, I made like three promises.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:01):**  One to myself, but in very real, it was, I'm going to somehow come back and make this farm  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:07):**  profitable.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:08):**  But to do that, you know, I've done loads of stupid ideas in my time, but for some reason,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:16):**  the smartest idea I ever had was basically I can't farm and I'm never, my granddad failed  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:21):**  because of outside forces.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:22):**  And if I fail, I want it to be my fault.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:26):**  So I decided then I needed to get a guaranteed market for what I was going to produce.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:30):**  And at that time, I thought it was beef cattle.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:32):**  So I knew I had to find a way of finding a market for that.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:36):**  You know, to do that, I approached my local butcher who's the very humble part of the  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:41):**  world, but they're probably the UK's best butcher.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:44):**  So I approached him and said, I'll go to London.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:46):**  That's a lucky break that you have one of the best butchers in the UK close to you,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:51):**  or did he became with you?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:52):**  We didn't realise at the time, everyone locally, so a couple of places called Launceston where  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:57):**  I was born in Cornwall, and we just grew up with Philip Warren Butcher and he was actually  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:01):**  the same age as my mum, or probably a bit younger.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:04):**  And like our population of our town is about 5000.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:08):**  And the Warrens, they have a retail shop where they have 7000 customers a week.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:13):**  So we just grew up with them and in our heads, we're thinking every town must have a butcher  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:17):**  like this.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:18):**  We just got so used to it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:20):**  Yeah, we didn't have a reference to know how good they were.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:23):**  But what they did-  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:24):**  You did when you went to London, I imagine.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:26):**  Yeah, we didn't know.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:28):**  So I approached him and said, I know London, I want to farm one day, but if you want me  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:36):**  to, I'm gonna help you create a market in London.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:39):**  And I didn't know anything about farming.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:40):**  So you didn't start a farming piece, you started finding your market in London, finding your  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:45):**  distribution channel through the butcher.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:48):**  And then, I mean, that's working backwards, which is fundamental.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:53):**  It was the first sort of, to be honest, I look back and it was actually, that was, I  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:57):**  don't know if genius, it was just such a, it just seemed so obvious to me.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:01):**  That's what I had, because I saw my granddad, I was just so entrenched that I'm not, I'm  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:07):**  gonna have my own guaranteed market.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:08):**  I'm never gonna let someone else dictate my price.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:12):**  So when I approached Philip Warren, his son Ian actually was looking to take over the  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:16):**  family business.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:17):**  And I think, I don't want to speak too much for them, but hopefully they're okay with  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:21):**  this.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:22):**  But just try to go back and start a business.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:24):**  His dad could not have made it any bigger.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:25):**  I think Philip Warren actually said to his son Ian, you can come into the business, but  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:29):**  I don't see how we can make it better.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:32):**  Like we've already got every single customer, you know?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:35):**  So I came along.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:36):**  Everybody can drive an hour like we got, like they're here.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:38):**  How can we, so I came along that time and said to him, it was such, it was a fluky time.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:45):**  He said, I'll do this London thing.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:47):**  Ian jumped on it and then I just went up to London and started trying to build, just basically  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:53):**  filling up chefs.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:54):**  And we found really crazy ways to get, because at Cornwall, we've got our topography as such  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:00):**  that it's wet and we grow more grass for longer in the season than anywhere else.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:05):**  So if you believe the grass fed ruminants is the best, then we should be the best really.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:12):**  But obviously it's 240 miles from London.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:15):**  So that's the issue is getting code stuff up to there.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:19):**  So it took about a year and a half.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:20):**  And enough of a boat, enough of a, because you're not going to drive with a little microvan  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:25):**  with a few kilos.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:26):**  I did.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:27):**  At the beginning for sure.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:28):**  But that's not.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:29):**  I did for two weeks.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:30):**  I drove, I drove up and down three times a week.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:33):**  And quite literally on the last winter I was driving back down again and I literally fell  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:38):**  asleep in the wheel and I was like, I suddenly woke up and I thought, oh, that's bad.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:43):**  And I was like, this could have been the end of the road.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:45):**  I'm going to call over the next service.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:46):**  And then before I did that, I fell asleep again.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:49):**  And I was like, so then I pulled over and I thought, you need a different site.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:52):**  This isn't the best.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:53):**  And then I basically, yeah, but then we moved up to London and then, and then what we did  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:00):**  was we found, we actually jumped on the back of the fish system.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:03):**  So there's fish going up and down to London, like a central hub.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:08):**  So we basically just, everything on the fish line, I'd go to the middle of nowhere at 4  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:13):**  in the morning and then deliver.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, it was, I basically delivered the van for seven years and then was up there  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:19):**  for 10 years.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:20):**  And, you know, it started, you know, small, but, you know, within 10 years, I mean, what  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:25):**  I became very good at was we didn't want to step on other people's toes.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:28):**  And there was, I always sort of called the big white chefs, like all the, you know, you  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:33):**  can know the UK, there's quite a lot of angry white chefs in a certain era.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:38):**  And we realized that we came at a time when a lot of people, a lot of chefs who've been  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:43):**  to Noma, young chefs, and they weren't like the cocaine, like booze, they were very serious  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:48):**  young people.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:49):**  And they needed serious suppliers.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:54):**  They needed serious, serious suppliers equally.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:56):**  And about six of them all went to Noma and they all came back and they realized it was  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:00):**  all about the impact of Noma.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:02):**  I think we're going to look back at that as a breeding ground, not just on the fermentation  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:07):**  side, because they have an amazing fermentation lab, but also just on training, like mentally  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:13):**  training a whole generation of chefs.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:14):**  Well, I do have issues with Noma because I have been there, but anyway, that's never  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:18):**  been, I have no clue, but it's interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:21):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:22):**  They must be the most influential.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:24):**  They must have influenced more people.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:26):**  So there's no doubt.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:27):**  There's no doubt.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:28):**  So I'm not going to be negative.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:29):**  So these chefs all came back.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:30):**  Influence can be good or bad.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:31):**  I'm not saying it's.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:32):**  I think the influence on chefs is great, but anyways, it's more, I won't, I won't.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:36):**  So there were a number of chefs, so we had a chap called Isaac McHale, James Lowe, you  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:41):**  know, just about five or six chefs that came back.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:43):**  How did you find it?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:44):**  Because you were in publishing.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:45):**  It wasn't that you were regular.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:46):**  Were you regular at the restaurants or you happened to find somebody at the street and  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:51):**  you went with your meat, like, can you please taste my meat?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:53):**  Like how does that work?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:54):**  I don't know.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:55):**  I think like, cause I, when I was in London for publishing, I didn't even go to a restaurant,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:00):**  you know, I was just into drinking to be honest.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:03):**  So when I went home.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:04):**  You got your calories somewhere else.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:05):**  So I was like, I just wasn't.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:06):**  And then when I came back to Cornwall, I just, I honestly, I look back on that and I don't  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:11):**  know, I don't know how it happened really.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:13):**  Like somebody inside me was like, I made this conscious of that and I'm like, I've got to  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:17):**  make this happen.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:18):**  You're always running on, I suppose, instinct really.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:21):**  Like there's something inside, there's something like, you know, there was no logic.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:25):**  It was like, I'm going to do this and that and that.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:26):**  It's hard to explain, but I'm glad it, I'm glad it went like it did.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:30):**  So yeah, I literally, I remember I phoned, there's a restaurant, I don't know if it was  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:34):**  Chucklebarko POI, very famous British chef and he used to own a restaurant called Harveys.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:39):**  He then that was taken over and it was actually called a restaurant called Chez Bruce.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:43):**  So it's one of the, so I literally phoned up the head chef, a chap called Matt Christmas.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:48):**  I first ever phone called to a chef, I just lived it up and said, oh that, that's the  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:51):**  sort of place you want to supply.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:52):**  So literally what happened, phoned this guy and said, look, there's Matt Chalfield, we're  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:56):**  going to work on behalf of the British company tomorrow and we're going to look to send Cornish  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:00):**  meat to London.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:01):**  We're not sure how good it is.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:03):**  Um, but you know, would you like to give it a try?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:06):**  It's not a very good sales pitch.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:07):**  He literally said, mate, you sound like an absolute idiot.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:10):**  Like he did literally, but you know, we'll give it a try.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:14):**  So he went in and it was, it was good, you know, and for a year and a half he was pretty  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:18):**  well already customer, but he was buying whole bit and it was that kept us going.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:21):**  And then, and then what happened is, there's no more chefs came back and they wanted to  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:26):**  know where the meat was going to come from.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:27):**  They heard that we were able to do that because the future Philip Warren, um, what made them  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:33):**  so special was in the UK when I like, and it was the same thing for my granddad.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:39):**  It was suddenly the supermarkets came and they wanted really high protein animals that  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:43):**  had no fat because that's how they're going to make money.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:46):**  So suddenly the UK, you know, we had all these beautiful native breeds of animals like the  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:50):**  North Devon, like the Hereford and suddenly Limousin and you know, Charolais came in and  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:56):**  Philip Warren basically went to all his farmers and said that if you've got the land for those  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:00):**  animals do it because you are going to make more money.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:03):**  But if your land is wet and you know, you're, you're going to struggle.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:08):**  So what I'll do is if you, if you haven't got the right land for these big ones, keep  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:12):**  doing the traditional breeds and we'll pay you.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:15):**  Smaller, lighter, more.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah, but just more like able to get fat on the type of pasture you've got.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:19):**  He said, if you do that, we'll pay you a premium.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:21):**  To turn grass into something useful.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:23):**  But he's, you know, he is a true genius for that one.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:27):**  You know, just such a, you know, he came from a humble beginning, bought a butcher shop  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:31):**  and, but he said this one was, I will pay you a premium.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:35):**  You keep on doing what you're doing.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:36):**  We'll pay you a premium.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:37):**  So, and I think for a long time, you know, the trend was for lean animals in Lawson  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:41):**  and you know, his butchery shop, he just had all this like beautiful, you know, we call  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:46):**  it, you call it, yeah, his native animals, all fat.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:50):**  And it was amazing, but then they came this generation of chefs that wanted that.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:54):**  They were looking for luckily.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:57):**  Imagine if you sort of feel it, well, it must be really interesting because he was going  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:00):**  against everything.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:01):**  And obviously they would make it, they also did dry aging.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:03):**  So that they were having animals that are fat, they've got a lot of weight.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:06):**  They're also dry aging, which means you're losing moisture.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:09):**  But he stuck with his guns and he just kept on doing it because he knew it was right.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:12):**  And then we came in with these chefs and basically these chefs were like, this is exactly what  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:16):**  we want.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:17):**  And you know, it was really, it was almost like you had to wait 20 years and suddenly  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:21):**  so word just spread that, you know, if you get to know, you had this meat that was impossible  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:26):**  to find.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:27):**  And what we then did was we started bringing, there's a chap called Tom Adams, to this day  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:31):**  is my favorite restaurant, a restaurant called PicQ.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:33):**  It was the beginning of like the street food thing.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:35):**  Tom has spent a lot of time in the US, came back, started the coolest restaurant ever  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:39):**  called PicQ.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:40):**  He was quite 22 at the time.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:41):**  Like what is it called?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:42):**  PicQ?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:43):**  PicQ.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:44):**  P-I-T-T-C-U-E.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:45):**  Perfect.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:47):**  Now I'll put a link below as well.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:49):**  And so he started that and he was 22.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:52):**  He started doing like a street food thing under the South Bank in London.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:55):**  It just went crazy.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:56):**  He heard what I was doing, met me and he literally asked me three questions that I couldn't answer.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:02):**  And I was meant to be like a middle man, but luckily I'm probably the worst middle.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:06):**  Like if you're a middle man, you better keep people apart.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:09):**  And you know, you don't want your butcher talking to the chef.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:11):**  You want to keep all the rest.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:12):**  So I said to Tom, I can't answer those.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:13):**  I'll tell you what you do, let's jump in the van for the weekend.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:17):**  We'll pop down to my butcher and you can go meet him.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:20):**  And then he came down.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:21):**  It was the first time we brought a chef down.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:22):**  And as soon as they met, like two obsessed people, one obsessed with, you know, like  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:27):**  you could just see like this is fire.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:30):**  It was just literally like, it was, it was funny.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:33):**  I actually do a food photographer.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:35):**  He actually came along with the trip with us.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:36):**  So it's all there on camera somewhere.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:38):**  Like, I mean, just a little thing.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:40):**  So for Shaperoox, we were doing whole rib, taking off the bone.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:44):**  So Tom Adams came in.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:45):**  This is actually a true story.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:47):**  He's watching this happen and then we're taking it off and then we've got the bone, the rib  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:52):**  cage.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:53):**  And Tom says, what'd you do with that?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:54):**  And they said, well, we trim it, take that out for pasties and then we have to chuck  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:57):**  the bones and the bones actually pay to get them, you know, sent for waste.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:02):**  And Tom said, well, why don't we, if you just cut it along the time, I'll take that.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:06):**  And then I'll, you know, so he ended up paying 80 pence a kilo for something that was costing  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:10):**  us money.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:11):**  But then he was, he then became a very famous dish, you know, like rib on the bone there.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:16):**  And they were charged with eight quid a portion.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:18):**  You know, like it was just when you saw this happen, like, right, so we're not, we're saving  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:22):**  money, you're making money.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:23):**  It was just brilliant.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:24):**  So then it became a bit of a, all these ambitious chefs, because I was doing all the deliveries.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:29):**  I was getting up at 4am in the morning, meeting all the chefs in the morning, being a bit  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:32):**  of a gossiper to be honest, getting quite well known for that.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:35):**  But then it became a bit of a thing like, if you want to get this meat, get to know  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:38):**  Matt and then he'll take you down to Cornwall and then you can meet everyone.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:41):**  And it suddenly became this like, tour agency, yeah, well, yeah, like, or a club, it just  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:47):**  became a club and everybody, it was, you just knew, was there enough meat?  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:52):**  Like this, I mean, was there, like, did this mean that suddenly your butcher, if it was  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:58):**  like having to seek other people or was there enough supply or what?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:02):**  I don't know.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:03):**  The supply was never ever an issue.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:06):**  The thing is, with butchery, you just need to, supply is not an issue.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:10):**  Like in Cornwall and Devon, on the border, there's just so many, you know, we've got  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:14):**  problem with the moor.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:15):**  What you've got is a system where you can, animals can be born on the moors and they  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:20):**  become, you know, born in a very healthy environment and then we bring them down and get them fat  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:23):**  on like, very fertile river Tamar Valley.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:26):**  So because Philip Warren had got all these farmers to do what they were doing, we had  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:31):**  just all this.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:32):**  But the issue was more, it's just balancing carcass.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:35):**  It's always been the issue is if you, I think Philip Warren says, you know, one of those  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:39):**  phrases is like, you lose money on the bits.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:41):**  You know, anybody can make money on the loins and the, that's what it was like, but you  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:46):**  need to be able to balance it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:48):**  So that was the, that became my job then was to find customers who would not only buy the  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:54):**  less desirable quote unquote pieces.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:56):**  And those are chefs.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:57):**  I mean, chefs can play with that, can do amazing things with waste, which you just mentioned.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:01):**  That's something you have to pay for to get rid of.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:03):**  They turn it into a dish.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:04):**  But then there's, if you look back on Twitter, I remember because we were looking to grow,  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:09):**  but we just needed to be able to get rid of the offcuts.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:14):**  And then literally a company, a guy just put it on Twitter saying that we're looking to  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:18):**  start a company in Cornwall called Hubox.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:20):**  They were going to get a seige and make a burger.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:23):**  And they said that we're looking for mince and corn.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:26):**  So I just thought it put them in touch with me and Warren.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:29):**  And now they've literally got like 20 burger places around the Southwest.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:32):**  So as we've grown, they have.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:34):**  So they literally take all of the offcuts, turn it into, so that, and now that, you know,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:38):**  just things like this is crazy.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:41):**  And you could have been doing this for, and you are for a long time.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:45):**  What made you decide?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:46):**  I mean, of course you promised it to your grandmother, but to get your hands into farming,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:52):**  the farming as well, not just because you probably saved actually quite a lot of farms  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:56):**  by selling these pieces into London for good prices.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:00):**  Well, how do you love also what it just made them.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:03):**  Like feel really good.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:04):**  Cause like, you know, at some point we started selling the Harrods and like in Cornwall,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:08):**  but we were selling to a place called Lebray, which is just, you know, we'd see certainly  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:12):**  that stage of recognized being the best restaurant in the UK.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:15):**  But obviously in Cornwall, no one knew.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:17):**  That was quite the idea.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:18):**  But then we started supplying Harrods and then suddenly like it was actually just gave  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:22):**  huge, you know, you go back there and that was when it was like, you know, the Warren  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:26):**  supply Harrods, you know, the same thing that you're having, you know, in the counter, you  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:30):**  know, you're having like, you know, the,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:32):**  the urban rural suddenly there was a huge amount of pride.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:37):**  It was a lot, you know, and suddenly it was like, Oh, you know, so, so what was your question?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:43):**  Why farming again?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:44):**  Why farming again?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:45):**  Why farming for you?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:46):**  So I sort of,  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:47):**  You created the market.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:48):**  Let's be clear.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:49):**  Like the market was there.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:50):**  When I knew, yeah.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:51):**  Then I'll be honest, I then I got fairly good advantage of seven years and it was actually  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:59):**  very mentally and physically very, very taxing.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:02):**  But last couple of years, the value, you know, you're on your own a lot and it was, and I  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:05):**  felt never further away from what I actually wanted to do.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:08):**  So on the face of it, yeah, we were getting quite popular, becoming quite social, knowing  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:12):**  lots of chefs and some LA, you know, becoming a bit of a face on London.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:16):**  So I'm actually, you know, yeah, came quite well known for what I was doing.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:20):**  So I'd, like the YBS Young British Foodies doing award, like honorary title.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:23):**  And then I was called, I think Maverick at the restaurant.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:26):**  I was still driving a van.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:28):**  I sort of laugh because at one point the evening standard in London, do a lot of the most influential  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:34):**  1000 people in London.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:35):**  And I actually managed to get on it.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:37):**  Most are still driving a van.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:38):**  So I sort of say I was probably one of London's most influential over van drivers.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:42):**  But I then, it's probably thing I started taking over kitchens and getting chefs to  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:47):**  do pop ups and things.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:48):**  And then I ended up taking over a pub in a very cool part of East London.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:52):**  And we just, you know, this is actually where I started doing the mountain actually, but  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:56):**  it just went mental, like, so we call it the Cornwall project.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:59):**  The whole idea was, you know, by supporting, by giving London very high produce, high quality  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:04):**  produce, we're going to support local economy.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:06):**  We took over this very, this pub and it just went mental and just became like a huge thing.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:11):**  And the guy who owned the pub then basically we worked, started working together.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:16):**  We actually got ourselves a very cool pub in Fitzrovia in central London.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:20):**  So I took it over and I ended up then basically became the landlord for two years.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:25):**  And I would say possibly very good at keeping people happy.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:29):**  The actual running of the pub, not so great, but we actually managed to get it our first  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:35):**  year.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:36):**  So it was a pub and restaurant, it was tiny.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:37):**  We got a big one, which, you know, I've had chef mates for 10 years who never got one.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:41):**  I became, you know, like Faye Masher, the famous evening standard reviewer gave us like  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:48):**  four out of five.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:49):**  You know, it was, it was quite a weird, it was a thing, but I'd never felt further away  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:53):**  from it and after two years actually me and my business partner fell out.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:58):**  And then the weirdest thing then, this is where it all sort of happened.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:01):**  Because at that time I had two others on the Facebook, I was doing fantastic work, you  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:05):**  know, being talked about by the press and all this, but I've never actually been as  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:08):**  unhappy.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:09):**  And when I say unhappy, I was really, you know, probably suffering depression.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:12):**  So I just know that I just didn't feel connected to Cornwall, felt a bit stupid.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:17):**  Then I basically ended up, a mate of mine had a houseboat in Shoreditch.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:21):**  I ended up basically leaving the pub, living on a houseboat for two years.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:26):**  And that's when it all started happening.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:27):**  And one of the funny stories I always say is I've lived there for two years and I'd  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:32):**  walk around and every morning, like it was a beautiful bit of London, like it's all urban,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:36):**  but there was just so many bits of wildlife.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:38):**  And every day, like, you know, like Grey Mullet would come up on the estuary and you'd be  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:41):**  able to see them and there'd be coots and swans and like just all sorts.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:44):**  And I'd go out every morning, just naturally looking at, you know, like how, you know,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:48):**  how the ducks are doing.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:49):**  They've had six chicks and they're all right.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:50):**  You know, the Egyptian geese, how they're doing.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:52):**  And in my head, I was just every morning just going around looking at them.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:56):**  And then we had like a meeting of the boat people, like, and I just sort of said, you  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:00):**  know, it just became obvious that no one else was interested in what all these animals were.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:04):**  And then I suddenly realized I'm basically doing what I would do in the farm.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:08):**  I'm going out every morning, checking all the animals were all right.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:11):**  But at that stage, I then, because it started getting into nature again, and then I just  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:16):**  started, I suppose it corrects us, I could see it suddenly became very apparent that  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:22):**  all the work we've done, you started hearing about plant-based food, the vegan movement.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:27):**  You started hearing about rewilding and the environmental aspects of cattle.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:31):**  And I suddenly realized that shit, all this work we've done, perhaps it's for nothing.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:34):**  Perhaps we are doing bad.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:36):**  And then happens, I've watched a YouTube video of both Alan Savory, which I think is a lot  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:41):**  of people, you know, quite a contentious figure, but, and obviously his idea was actually...  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:46):**  Not in our crowd, I think.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:47):**  No, I think, so I watched the famous TED talk and basically it was, we don't, you know,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:54):**  we actually probably need more remnants if we're going to save the planet.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:56):**  And I'm like, well, that sounds too good to be true.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:59):**  But you know, it's only saying, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:03):**  is.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:04):**  I then just went, that's when it really started.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:05):**  So I basically then started watching YouTube probably for like 12 hours a day for like  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:10):**  two years.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:11):**  And just suddenly got obsessed with regenerative.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:14):**  So I got very obsessed with identity politics and what I could see in America.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:18):**  I was worried that seeing what was happening in America, identity politics, I could see  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:21):**  it linking with the vegan movement.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:22):**  I could see these movements in London.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:23):**  I just became really, I basically, I remember like in this country, Brexit happened and  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:29):**  Trump got in and I had the pub at the time and I was just totally oblivious.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:33):**  And suddenly I was like, I've got myself really stupid.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:36):**  I've been doing all this, fan-driving, doing this.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:40):**  I'm dumb.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:41):**  I need to get smart, like quick.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:43):**  So that's, so basically it was a two year period of just so much information.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:46):**  On a houseboat watching YouTube.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:48):**  To understand farming.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:49):**  They probably thought, I was like, why is everybody thought like I was on heroin or  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:53):**  doing something terrible.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:54):**  Like that guy's just always doing this.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:55):**  We don't see it.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:56):**  But I was just literally just watching.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:57):**  And if I saw an interesting farmer, I'd go and see them.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:01):**  So I visited at the time quite a few farmers in the UK and then the biggest moment.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:06):**  So you were not completely solitary in the houseboat.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:09):**  No, you went, you went to visit luckily.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:11):**  I still working the rides, I still looking at the chefs.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:14):**  I was in my houseboat and then, you know, but one bit, the amazing bit, I've always  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:19):**  felt that Hamon is the best meat in the world.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:21):**  And I got an invitation, you know, from my widow things to go and speak, to go and meet,  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:28):**  you know, some of the farmers.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:29):**  And I think it was happened upon, they're basically the best Hamon supplies in the world.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:34):**  And I spent, I went there and spent like a week with them.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:38):**  And I just realized like, it's a real pithy of how do you get the best meat in the world?  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:44):**  And then I was suddenly like, actually to get a world class animal meat, you need to  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:50):**  have it's walked around a long time.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:51):**  So the Iberico pigs for a year and a half, they're actually foraging for a living.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:56):**  They're like trying to find all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:58):**  It's very dry conditions.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:59):**  They're actually, you know, so for after a year and a half, they literally weigh 80 kilos.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:04):**  They're really thin.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:05):**  And then they put them in the acorn trees.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:07):**  And within four months, they literally double their weight.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:10):**  So to get a lot of muscle at the beginning.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:13):**  So yeah, not a lot of fat.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:14):**  And then suddenly fat.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:15):**  So to get world class meat, you need an animal that's walked around a huge amount of his  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:20):**  life.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:21):**  And then at the end, then you need to put fat cover on the end.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:24):**  And obviously, and that was like, cause we've done mutton frequently when I was at the pub  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:28):**  like three years before.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:30):**  And it was just incredible.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:31):**  I just suddenly hit me, this is the reason that's incredible.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:34):**  I suddenly realized no animal in the world, well any domesticated animal has walked further  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:40):**  than sheep do.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:41):**  And sheep get to a certain that, you know, once they're ready to be killed, they've walked.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:46):**  Like, God knows.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:47):**  So then it was like, let's just get those animals and put fat on it.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:51):**  Surely, and I knew a lot by then about aging of meat and the processes.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:55):**  So it was just like, right, actually, I think I've got an idea to go back to call.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:59):**  I'm going to call mum.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:00):**  So I call mum at night.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:01):**  Right, I want to come back.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:02):**  Mum had a lot of issues.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:04):**  My stepdad, you know, that she's going to be getting a divorce next week.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:07):**  But they were losing, they still taking over the farm and they were just losing loads of  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:11):**  money and it was just a disaster.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:13):**  So I came in and said, right, I've got this idea.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:15):**  I want to basically buy about 80 oats, get them fat and see what happens.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:20):**  And so bless mum, you know, she gave me the chance really, and we did it.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:25):**  And there's a real hunch.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:26):**  And I remember going to Philip Warren at the time.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:29):**  What did he say?  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:30):**  He said, honestly, the number of Ian and Philip Warren are just, they're two, my father and  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:35):**  son, you know, Ian's learnt so much from his dad, but they are just so astute businessmen  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:38):**  and they just know instantly whether an idea is good or not.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:42):**  They just know, you know, and over the 10 years I knew them, I told so many ideas.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:47):**  And he just used to look at me like, this is why it won't work.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:51):**  And I'm like, and the same with Philip Warren.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:54):**  So I went to Philip Warren and I got this idea of basically fattening oats.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:56):**  And he went, literally, Matt, that's a brilliant idea.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:59):**  And I was just like, what?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:01):**  That's the first time you ever said that.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, it was like, and I was just like, he said, the main reason you got ideas is because  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:05):**  you've got an analyst board a long way, you're going to put fat on it.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:07):**  But he said the real clever bit is sheep produce something called laminin, which is basically  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:12):**  producing the glands and it waterproofs their skin.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:15):**  But when you eat lamb, that tacky flavour, that's actually laminin.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:19):**  After about six or seven years old, sheep stopped producing it or produce it, and it  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:23):**  also there's no tackiness.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:24):**  So he said, by that age, people will be expecting it to be tough and tacky, but if you can age  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:30):**  it, dry age it, it'll be tender, and there'll be no tackiness.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:33):**  So it'll just be the exact opposite of what you're expecting.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:36):**  And as soon as I heard that, I'm like, shit, that's, you know, okay.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:40):**  And then my next piece of luck was just before, this is like three and a half years ago, I  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:45):**  went to something called the Oxford Real Farming Conference, again, because of my learning.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:48):**  It was literally four months before I started.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:50):**  And I was still then like, I heard about his Regen Ag stuff, but I'm going to have to go  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:55):**  back and I'm going to have to use a fertilizer, I'm going to have to do this, you know, and  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:58):**  I just didn't know how to do it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:00):**  So I went and met a chap called Chris Jones, who's very into the old beaver thing in the  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:04):**  UK.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:05):**  There's a bit of a secret beaver club going on in the UK.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:08):**  I think I listened to a book.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:11):**  Did he write a book?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:12):**  Derek Gal, who I'm actually quite probably mentioning, I recognise the name.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:19):**  So Derek Gal wouldn't be like Chris Jones or not, you know, but he's just a beautiful,  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:23):**  incredible man.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:25):**  And I saw him, I went to talk on basically, I went to the Oxford Real Farming Conference.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:30):**  How to fatten them without all the inputs?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah, it was the old way.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:34):**  So I went to Oxford Real Farming Conference, thinking I was going to take up farm, but  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:38):**  it's thinking I just don't know if I can farm.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:40):**  And I happened upon a talk by a chap called Steve Gabriel, and he farms in upstate New  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:45):**  York.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:46):**  And he was basically coming from a conservation environment background a bit like me.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:51):**  And then he had sheep in upstate New York, they had a horrific drought.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:55):**  Everyone sheep and cattle were struggling.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:57):**  And he was really struggling.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:58):**  He then just thought, right, I've got a word, I'm just gonna put the sheep in the woods.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:02):**  And then two months later, they came out looking like, I sort of say like rock stars, like  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:06):**  and he was like, so then he's gone really deep into this.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:09):**  So he talked about silph pasture, and he talked about it very much as a drought resistance,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:13):**  you know.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:14):**  So when I then, which is funny for you in a place where it's wetter than anywhere else.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:19):**  Yeah, of course, no longer.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:21):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:22):**  I mean, I mean, it was just such a good time to be honest that, you know, all these things  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:26):**  happen by chance.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:27):**  But I am he Yes, I saw this.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:32):**  And then afterwards, there was question answers.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:33):**  And actually, Chris Jones from Cornwall.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:35):**  So I didn't know Chris, but I heard him talk.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:37):**  It was so lovely because this Steve Gabriel was like the most gentle, gentle spoken man.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:41):**  And Chris just started swearing and just so charismatic.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:45):**  And I'm like, I've got to meet that man.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:47):**  So I went down and met him.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:50):**  And it was honestly was the most inspirational words I ever heard.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:52):**  This changed my life really.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:53):**  They were like, I'm not gonna waste your time.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:55):**  And I certainly don't want you to waste mine.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:57):**  But do you want me to sum up everything I've learned in 50 years of farming in one sentence?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:01):**  And I'm like, okay, of course.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:04):**  And he said, if you farm for nature, labor looks after itself.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:08):**  And to me, because I knew a lot about nature, and I was very unique in farming where I was  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:12):**  starting with flavor.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:13):**  I was so used to delivering meat to chefs and tasting it.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:16):**  You know, that to me was like, I can do that.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:19):**  Like actually, and ever since then, I've had some of my best mates.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:24):**  We grew up together, still mates after 40 years.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:27):**  And they've all actually been comprehensive kids, you know, no background, but they've  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:31):**  all gone off and done really well in their own field.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:34):**  We all met up about three months ago, and they all said, even though they're very successful,  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:38):**  they're still actually like they're going posture syndrome.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:42):**  They just don't feel like how am I there.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:43):**  And when I was doing a restaurant, even though I got a biblical modelist, I felt like I was  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:46):**  an imposter.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:47):**  But since when Chris Jones said those words, I've never ever, all I've ever felt is I can  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:53):**  do this.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:54):**  Like, I can, you know, like, it was just a, I can do this now.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:56):**  Like, and I've never looked back.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:58):**  It was, if I had heard those words, I don't know.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:02):**  So I went back to family farm.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:05):**  We had a small home in Cornwall.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:06):**  I was able to do a bit of sheep there.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:08):**  My stepdad was being really, really pretty nasty, actually.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:11):**  He was really trying to make me do this.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:13):**  So I went to the actual family farm, but he was stepdad was farming all the land, absolutely  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:18):**  horrifically terribly.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:19):**  But we had this, well, so we had this, I don't know, I think he asked me questions.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:24):**  I'll just go with it.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:25):**  But basically, I've seen this talk by Steve Bing and by Steve Gabriel.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:31):**  And we, when we grow up, so obviously all my granddad, he basically ploughed the land,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:35):**  drained it, but that water had to go somewhere.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:37):**  So basically it went into our ancient woodland.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:40):**  And so,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:41):**  Now you remember the talk at the conference.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:45):**  So when we were growing up, so it basically, all the water went in there for 40 years.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:51):**  So when we grew up, we literally weren't allowed in there because cattle would go in there  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:54):**  and actually get chest deep in mud.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:56):**  And you know, like it was so, so my nan, he was a very strong character.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:01):**  And she just never allowed to go in there.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:03):**  Anyway, when I came back to the farm, I was really upset because I just see my stepdad  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:07):**  do this horrific stuff.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:08):**  I then thought, I'm just going to go to walk in the woods.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:11):**  And also I went in there with my nan in my ears, you know, she'd been passed away like  
**[0:44:14-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:14):**  10 years.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:15):**  But like, you know,  
**[0:44:16-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:16):**  You basically went in there with like, floating things around your waist just to be ready.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:20):**  I literally was just like, any moment I'm going to die.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:23):**  And then I suddenly walk around and I'm like, this is ancient coffins.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:27):**  This is like, this is like, you know, this is ancient coffins.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:31):**  This is, we used to farm this.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:32):**  Like this used to be managed.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:33):**  Obviously, you know, that'd been a few hundred years ago.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:36):**  You could just tell.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:37):**  So I went to mum and said, look mum, I know I'm not allowed to farm the fields, but can  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:41):**  I go in the woods?  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:42):**  Farm the forest.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:43):**  Yeah, mum was like, do whatever you want.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:44):**  And that was, that was my chance.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:45):**  It just gave me that in.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:46):**  And it was all these things that happened.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:49):**  And then, so then I just basically, for one year, for the first winter, it was pretty  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:54):**  tough.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:55):**  It was like mud.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:56):**  I'd never even used a chainsaw.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:57):**  I've started chopping down trees.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:00):**  But it was the absolute making that, you know, that it's all those weird things.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:03):**  And now I, you know, what I'm probably most well known for now, and to be honest, I've  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:07):**  been quite, I wouldn't be doing it three years, but I'll be quite cocky.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:11):**  But I've just literally been interviewed this week for UK sheep farm of the year.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:15):**  So it's just after three years, it's pretty quite crazy.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:17):**  But I think what I'm really well known for, A is putting mutton back on the map, making  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:22):**  London restaurants, you know, high end.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:24):**  But I suppose what I'm really well known for, if I am really, is basically going to woodland  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:30):**  and compensating it, basically showing what can happen if you add remnants to an ancient  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:36):**  woodland.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:37):**  You know, like it's, yeah, it's just been a making move really.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:40):**  What's the change if you would like that first time you walked into that, into the woodland  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:45):**  and just try to make it visually obviously, because we're in an audio podcast.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:49):**  And if you would go into that same, if you're still farming that, how different is it?  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:53):**  Like how does it feel, smell, sound?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:56):**  What's really interesting is my uncle Lanthionne, like a half acre bit.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:00):**  So we've left that.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:01):**  That's totally like it was.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:02):**  And next to it, we have a bit which I've done.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:05):**  So when you go in there now, right, even now, it's basically all the canopy is totally full.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:11):**  It's totally full.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:12):**  So no light at all is getting into that canopy floor.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:16):**  You can't hear any birds.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:17):**  In the piece that you left.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:18):**  Yeah, in the piece you left.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:19):**  This is the control.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:20):**  This is the control side.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:21):**  Yeah, it's the control area.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:22):**  Leaves are still there from last year.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:26):**  So even though the leaves fell, so after nine months, leaves are still there.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:31):**  So basically to me, and there's literally, I work quite closely with guys in the Eden  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:35):**  project.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:36):**  I don't know if you know about the Eden project in Cornwall.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:37):**  There's a guy there obsessed with plants who comes and actually measures everything I'm  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:40):**  doing.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:41):**  So just summarizing, there's almost like no life.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:44):**  There's no life.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:45):**  So basically it's dead and there's literally six plants coming out of the lawn.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:47):**  There's wood soil, there's ivy, and there's a few other things, but that's it.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:50):**  So basically you go in there, I think to the UK, you would think that's like your perfect  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:54):**  beautiful woodland, but it's just dead.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:57):**  There's nothing, like it's dead.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:59):**  So now where I've now gone into my bit, all I've done is coppiced a few trees, the hazel,  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:05):**  the willow, silverbatch.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:06):**  It all comes back, coppiced it.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:09):**  I've then put in sheep where I think it's right.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:12):**  If you go in there in May, and it's all on video, like it's all on my YouTube, but also  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:18):**  the BBC actually came to film it the first time I ever put sheep in three years ago.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:22):**  If you go in there now, especially in May, there's literally 160 plants from the seedbed  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:27):**  have come up.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:28):**  It's now probably one of the most productive bits of land, probably in the UK, and you've  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:34):**  got trees coming up coppiced, they eat those, they eat the grass, and it grows.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:41):**  The fields, where I'm a devil, it's just so, for farming, I think if you get depression,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:46):**  you get like mental health issues, because nothing's growing.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:49):**  In the winter, towards that last March and April, nothing's growing, but the woodland  
**[0:47:56-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:56):**  starts growing in mid-Feb.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:58):**  Spring happens six weeks earlier, and it just comes alive.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:03):**  All it is, and this is all from the seed bank, so seeds can probably last in the seed bank.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:08):**  Nothing planted, it's just been there for 40 years.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:12):**  You go into one bit, it's dead.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:13):**  You go into the next bit, and it's like you cannot.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:17):**  All I've done is coppiced, blit and light, and then put in sheep when I think it's right,  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:21):**  pull them out, and it's just night and day.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:27):**  I have chefs down all the time, and within, I always say, within five minutes of visiting  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:31):**  my farm, you'll realize everything they say about sheep and ruminants is just nonsense.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:35):**  There you are.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:36):**  Yeah, I was going to ask, you almost went down the vegan route, but you didn't.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:44):**  What did they teach you over the last years on the impact of ruminants or the importance  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:49):**  of ruminants?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:50):**  If you had to summarize that, not even short, but what would you tell these chefs when they  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:55):**  come and say, I've heard about the impact of methane and blah, blah, blah, and we should  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:59):**  all eat plant-based burgers?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:02):**  Of course, this is characterizing it, but how do they go through that transition in  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:07):**  five minutes?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:08):**  I'll tell you an absolutely true story.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:09):**  There's a lady called Hannah, she's happy to be talking about it.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:13):**  We started selling my sheep online, and then she started buying it, and then I saw her  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:19):**  name pop up, and then she contacted me on Instagram and said, can I chat to you?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:24):**  I want to send you a few questions.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:25):**  So she sent me a few questions.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:26):**  She ended up sending me an email that was just so long, and just reading it, I'm like,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:32):**  this lady, Hannah, she's got issues.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:34):**  She's obviously got mental health issues associated with food.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:37):**  She's just so in-depth.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:38):**  So I said, I'll tell you what, I haven't really got time to answer this.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:42):**  I think it's better than wanting to come down.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:44):**  So she basically came down to visit, and as I picked her up from the station, we drove  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:47):**  her back to my farm.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:48):**  And she basically said, Matt, the truth is I hate animal agriculture.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:53):**  I think it's all wrong.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:55):**  I've been eating for seven years.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:58):**  I've been vegan, and I was going to die.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:00):**  I had to eat meat.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:04):**  So then I saw yours, and ethically, it looked like something I could, at least it looked  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:09):**  ethically like a good thing.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:11):**  And obviously, I'm driving to my farm thinking, oh shit, if we get to my farm and she doesn't  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:17):**  like it, like, she got there, and I was quite emotional because she just saw the sheep,  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:24):**  and she literally started crying.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:25):**  And I was like, it was just, you know, so I'm like, so what I say to people is, what  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:30):**  I say is, so when I went through my two years stage, I ended up, I started debating, so  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:36):**  I went on Twitter, and I followed the, you mentioned earlier you followed me on Twitter  
**[0:50:40-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:40):**  there.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:41):**  I'm like, Instagram is my sales and marketing division, but I'm really nice and lovely,  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:44):**  and it's all about stuff.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:45):**  But I call Twitter my political wing.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:48):**  But for two years, I just talked to re-wilds, and I talked to vegans, and I talked to environmentalists.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:54):**  So I think what I did was try to, in my head, come up with something to answer every single  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:58):**  one of their questions.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:59):**  So I think I've probably come up with the farming system that can answer all those questions.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:02):**  And the one thing I say is, I was in my caravan the other day looking over my pasture.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:07):**  It's quite late at night.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:08):**  A barn owl come over.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:09):**  It was clearly was hunting over my pasture.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:12):**  I took a photo, and this dear old vegan chap just went, grow vegetables instead.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:17):**  I went, okay, right, let's unpack that.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:21):**  And I just said, mate, you see this field there, right?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:24):**  I literally kill 20 sentient beings per acre per year.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:27):**  I fatten 20 sheep per acre per year.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:30):**  So I fatten about 600 sheep on about 30 acres of pasture and 10 acres of wood.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:37):**  So I'm not afraid about that.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:38):**  I kill 20 sentient beings per acre.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:40):**  Right.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:41):**  But if you want me to grow veg, I'm going to have to plow that field.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:44):**  And when I plow that, I'm probably going to kill 10,000 sentient beings.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:47):**  I'm going to kill shrews.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:48):**  The buzzers won't be able to feed me out here.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:51):**  And then I said, if you want to grow potatoes for at least three or four years, hardly anything  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:56):**  is going to live on that field.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:57):**  So not only am I killing everything when I start with, I'm ruining the ecosystem for  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:00):**  the rest of it.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:01):**  But if I just keep on killing my 20 sentient beings, and I'm giving them a good retirement,  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:06):**  then I create an ecosystem for literally tens of thousands of sentient beings.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:11):**  So when people come and visit, it's just within five minutes, you just get it.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:17):**  So now it's now really hard arguing with these.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:21):**  They don't really come and debate me now because I think they know they're just going to come  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:28):**  over and have a bit of a personal crisis because I think pretty quickly, I'm just quite good  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:33):**  at getting to the point.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:36):**  Did you ever have not that reaction, meaning an opposite, like somebody that came and didn't  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:44):**  have that switch?  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:46):**  No, it's just, honestly, it's very interesting.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:51):**  If you show people this bit of wood we haven't touched, and then you show them what I have.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:57):**  And also, the sheep just seem so happy.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:01):**  And all the sheep I'm getting, I'm basically buying sheep that would have been killed six  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:06):**  months before.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:07):**  So you're giving them an extra X month plus creating that.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:14):**  We had a discussion with Charles Eisenstein here actually on that piece.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:18):**  Death is part, I don't want to paraphrase, please go and listen to that episode.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:22):**  But death is part of this agriculture system or the stewarding the land if we like it or  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:27):**  not.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:28):**  It's a very good case of you can't escape it if you eat potatoes or if you don't.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:34):**  And there is a strong case to be made to actually graze it.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:38):**  Also from the environmental and all the emission side of things.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:40):**  But let's leave that to the LCA people.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:42):**  But what does it do coming back to the flavor, like that woodland mix with pasture?  
**[0:53:49-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:49):**  Because your hunch was it was amazing.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:51):**  Your hunch of your butcher was it's going to be amazing, but did it end up being amazing?  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:56):**  Yeah, it's obviously what happens is all the flavors in the meat already because they've  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:01):**  done all their walking.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:02):**  What I'm now trying to do is get incredible flavor on that fat.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:06):**  And with fat, what happens is like I want animals as thin as I can get so then I can  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:11):**  add totally lean fat.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:13):**  And when you dry age, that fat permeates into, if you do it properly, it permeates into the  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:19):**  meat.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:20):**  So it's so important.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:21):**  Now my woodland, because I'm Dan Ryan from the Eden Project, we think my family probably  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:27):**  grazed it with animals 400 years ago and probably stopped 300 years ago.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:32):**  The climate in Devon apparently changed dramatically 300 years ago.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:34):**  It became even wetter, so we probably haven't managed that for 300 years.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:40):**  I would say every single plant in that wood is communicating underneath the soil with  
**[0:54:47-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:47):**  a mycelium network.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:50):**  And obviously if you've got one plant growing in a field, the fungi is feeding, like it's  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:58):**  doing its bit to try to get the nutrients from its surroundings.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:00):**  But if you've got a whole mycelium network in a whole wood that's been there for at least  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:05):**  300 years, the stuff that it's doing on the soil, the stuff it's extracting, you can see  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:09):**  it like I went to my wood this morning, and the vibrancy of plants, you can see the vibrancy  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:16):**  in plants.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:17):**  I think we do need to start measuring the nutrient levels and things, but you can see  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:23):**  when a plant is firing, it's luminous and it's bright green, and everything in my wood  
**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:28):**  all the time is bright green.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:30):**  It's just like, you just know this crazy stuff.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:36):**  So these sheep, they're eating that, and my job is to try and make them as relaxed as  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:44):**  possible so their fermentation is good.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:46):**  I do sort of, I've got issues slightly, I think like say sourdough things, I think in  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:50):**  London, in East London, people are forgetting that the whole e-gen thing is about sourdough,  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:56):**  and I actually think it's about the luminance.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:59):**  But all these people are like, they're getting such a high profile for basically doing fermentation.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:04):**  And I'm like, you've got sheep, that's what they do.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:10):**  You need to respect them more, because I'm sure they're a lot better at getting the nutrients  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:14):**  and that, but you just, if I can get those animals, and my job is to make them as relaxed  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:18):**  as possible, because what sheep would do, they go and eat in the morning, they then  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:22):**  go into their first stomach, comes up and then they chew the cud, and then it goes back  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:26):**  down.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:27):**  And that's the bit that's really important.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:28):**  I want sheep, sheep farmers do this thing called alive or dead, where they go into a  
**[0:56:32-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:32):**  field, don't worry, it's not cold.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:35):**  You'll see a sheep.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:36):**  No, no, I'm interested.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:37):**  It was an interesting phase.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:38):**  You'll see a sheep just zonk that, and you just think that's dead.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:42):**  You go to, you then get close to people, farmers are like alive or dead, they do a video, alive  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:46):**  or dead, alive or dead, and then you'll get, and the closer you get to it, before it jumps  
**[0:56:50-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:50):**  up, because basically it's fermenting, it's just relaxing, it's chilling, it's just there  
**[0:56:53-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:53):**  like letting this body just get all the nutrients.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:56):**  So what I want is my sheep looking as dead as possible during that stage, because I know  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:00):**  then they're extracting every bit of nutrient and that's going into their fat cover.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:03):**  And they never are dead, you know, one day I'll do it, like live, and it might be dead.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:08):**  So my sheep are owed and the other one does die, and not less than I thought actually,  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:12):**  but my whole job is to get them eating incredible stuff.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:15):**  But also the remarkable thing is I've got 150 plants growing in that wood.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:20):**  It's obvious they self-heal.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:21):**  I mean, everyone talks about it, it's not like it's a bird, I witness it every day in  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:25):**  my life is sheep, because I'm getting old sheep, you know, there's some farmers decided  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:29):**  they're not good enough anymore for breeding, you know, he's going to send them off the  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:32):**  abattoir, I'd like those.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:34):**  Some of them are quite healthy, there might be a reason why, you know, he's offloaded  
**[0:57:38-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:38):**  them but more often than not, it's just that, you know, they're at an age where they just  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:41):**  they can't really process enough glass to feed them in the lab.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:44):**  But I just put them in the wood, and I like a simple like, they just come out looking  
**[0:57:48-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:48):**  like rock stars, like, they just, sheep they're healthy, they'll go in there, eat a bit, but  
**[0:57:54-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:54):**  they'll just want to go back in the field and like get fat, but the ones that are not  
**[0:57:57-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:57):**  too well just stay there.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:59):**  So I just basically lock them in, you know, and then they just get healthy.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:03):**  The transformation is self medicine.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:05):**  Yeah, obviously, I've just seen it so many times now, like, well, sheep, you think you're  
**[0:58:09-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:09):**  buggered, put them in two weeks later, they just come out.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:12):**  And then to be honest, I think their body gets into balance.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:14):**  So and then they then get fat, you know, my job is to fatten sheep, put a fat couple on  
**[0:58:19-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:19):**  them, you know, but but also the beauty of my system is, and where I suppose if you go  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:24):**  on my Instagram, where I, you know, become quite well known as well is, I remember the  
**[0:58:29-0:58:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:29):**  first sheep you got, literally mum, we bought like 60 sheep.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:34):**  And mum said, right now you need to farming, right?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:36):**  You must never, never name an animal, never get emotional, you know, you've got to be  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:40):**  tough and brutal.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:41):**  Like, you know, these are the years to get fatter, so okay, cool.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:45):**  Literally, got this first 60, the sheep came running up to us, just like basically wanted  
**[0:58:49-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:49):**  to be pet, you know, petted.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:52):**  And mum, just looking at mum like, oh, Jesus Christ.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:54):**  So basically, what happens with sheep is, obviously, they've got two teats, and if they  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:58):**  have triplets, there's always a spare lamb, and often a farmer will bolt feed that.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:02):**  But then you basically humanize the animal.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:05):**  But then they ended up, you know, going back into flock.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:08):**  So every time I buy one of those, and it's not very often, I'll buy a flock of like two  
**[0:59:12-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:12):**  years ago, I bought a flock of Dorsets, which are quite lovely sheep, but they're quite,  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:16):**  they're not particularly big fans of people, but there's one Dorset that came running up.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:20):**  And I've kept that one, so I've now probably got 10 sheep.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:22):**  What I now have guys, farmers who've got their own 10 lambs, they send them to me.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:26):**  So I've probably got four sheep that are basically pets of my other farmers, but their kids have  
**[0:59:32-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:32):**  grown up.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:33):**  I've got six of my own, and I call them my management team.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:36):**  So what's incredible is you just learn things, don't you?  
**[0:59:39-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:39):**  So I'll buy sheep from Bob and Moor, they probably see a farmer twice a year, they're  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:43):**  wild as hell.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:44):**  They come into my field, and they'll-  
**[0:59:46-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:46):**  You have these 10 managers that keep them in check.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:49):**  Yeah, they'll be like, so I've got about 240 sheep.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:51):**  So you get 40 sheep, they'll arrive, and they'll look at me like, they basically look at me  
**[0:59:55-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:55):**  like I'm a wolf, like a predator.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:57):**  The first thing I do is then get the dog in, Morgan, he's quite funny, and that makes  
**[1:00:01-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:01):**  the sheep suddenly get together.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:02):**  But these sheep are still very scared of me.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:04):**  I then walk into the field, and literally 10 sheep come running up to me for a cuddle.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:08):**  So I'm there just basically cuddling sheep, and all the other sheep are literally just  
**[1:00:13-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:13):**  staring at me.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:14):**  They are just staring at me.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:16):**  But then the next time I go in the field, they don't move a muscle.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:19):**  I can walk around the whole flock, and not a single sheep moves.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:22):**  And they say, sheep have got the best facial recognition of any animal on earth.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:27):**  They have to, you know, like your lambs, your mum's faces all look very similar.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:32):**  They obviously can tell by the bar.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:34):**  So within a sheep, as soon as you walk in that field once, they'll remember you.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:38):**  So obviously when I go in the second time, it's just quite cool.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:43):**  And I mean, it's a potential robot, but what's next?  
**[1:00:47-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:47):**  What would you envision?  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:48):**  Now you have to set up this system that works really well in your farm.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:52):**  You have the guaranteed market.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:54):**  You spend quite a bit of time looking at your land, looking at your sheep, which is great.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:59):**  What do you feel is okay?  
**[1:01:00-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:00):**  And you've learned all this stuff on the ruminant impact on land and on woods, which is incredible  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:06):**  because we look at woods in many places and think this is sort of the optimum state of  
**[1:01:10-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:10):**  et cetera.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:11):**  And you've shown that that's absolutely not the case.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:12):**  Like there's a whole world beyond that.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:14):**  We look at very degraded land, honestly, that could be regenerated.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:19):**  What do you see?  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:21):**  Because you're not close to any type of retirement.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:23):**  Like what do you see as next step?  
**[1:01:25-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:25):**  I was just thinking, we ought to talk about some sort of idea to invest money.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:33):**  There's something called the government.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:34):**  I'm trying to work it away, but I don't need to rely on government money.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:38):**  It's possible.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:39):**  But for me, the UK government, I think Europe's heading in this direction is basically investing  
**[1:01:45-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:45):**  in big corporate companies, investing in offsetting carbon.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:52):**  By doing that, the government's going to let people plant trees and sort of the idea of  
**[1:01:58-1:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:58):**  offsetting.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:59):**  For me, there's something very interesting they're looking at, which is like nature recovery  
**[1:02:02-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:02):**  schemes.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:03):**  What they're looking at doing is you need to have 500 connecting acres and I've only  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:09):**  got 40 at the moment.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:11):**  My auntie's got 40.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:13):**  It's definitely aimed at the big landowners and trying to get farmers working together.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:18):**  It has to be 500 acres of connected land.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:21):**  But for me, in my woodland, we've got something called a willow tree and a willow tree is  
**[1:02:25-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:25):**  actually UK's fastest-growing breeding bird.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:28):**  And I've actually got loads of them.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:30):**  I've got a lot of them in my house, but I'm not going to be able to get them to come down.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:35):**  And that was a funny story.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:36):**  So they did believe me.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:37):**  Over the winter, I was feeding all the birds and the thing.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:38):**  And I've been an orthologist.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:39):**  Willow trees look really similar to marsh tit, but there's just slight differences.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:42):**  I phoned at Devon Wild and I just said, no, I think I've got willow tit and they said,  
**[1:02:46-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:46):**  no, you probably haven't.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:47):**  They're going to be marsh tits.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:48):**  They're very similar.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:49):**  I went, okay.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:50):**  They said what we'll do, we'll come out in spring.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:51):**  What we'll do, we'll play the voice, the song of the male willow tit.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:56):**  And if there's any in there, it might take hours, but they'll eventually come and try  
**[1:03:03-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:03):**  and fight the territory.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:04):**  I said, okay, cool.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:05):**  So they came out in spring and there's no word of a lie.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:07):**  Choked with Rob Purdy, very good mate of mine.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:09):**  First time I met him, came down.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:10):**  We literally got 20 meters from the woodlands.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:12):**  And he went, I don't need to do anything.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:15):**  You've got willow tit.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:16):**  We then walked into the wood and literally, it's all on Twitter, it's all on Instagram.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:20):**  There's a video of two willow tit building a nest, literally like 10 meters from where  
**[1:03:25-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:25):**  we walked in.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:26):**  So basically what I'm looking at doing is we've got the river Kerry, which yeah, runs  
**[1:03:31-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:31):**  along and we've got a very ancient railway line that hasn't been used in like 70 years.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:37):**  So my idea is to try and access, buy or lease the land on the railway lane, and then basically  
**[1:03:43-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:43):**  start trying to connect the railway line and the river and start increasing the breeding  
**[1:03:48-1:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:48):**  grounds of the willow tit whilst farming in a way that feeds people and helps nature.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:55):**  So that's my big project now is, and I think that government scheme, it's not totally official  
**[1:04:01-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:01):**  yet.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:02):**  They're doing trials, but I think for investment, looking at that would be really interesting  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:05):**  for people because I basically, there was a bit of land about a mile away and because  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:10):**  we all had money going on sheep and it's going on, we're actually building a barn for the  
**[1:04:14-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:14):**  fresh.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:15):**  I just said to someone, someone's interested in this land, you know, you can buy it and  
**[1:04:18-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:18):**  I'll rent it off you.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:19):**  It's just on Instagram.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:20):**  And about 20 people contacted.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:21):**  I was like, oh, right.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:22):**  Okay.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:23):**  But that land's so, but I think there's going to be, for me, there's going to be, it's obviously  
**[1:04:35-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:35):**  legislation is pointing towards big corporate companies offsetting, particularly like the,  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:39):**  you know, the property sector, you know, big property developments.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:42):**  You know, I'm pretty old-fashioned on this and I've got friends who do it and I've been  
**[1:04:45-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:45):**  looking at it for a couple of years, but to me, it's a bit of a con for our government.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:49):**  It's a bit of a, it's aimed at landowners.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:52):**  It's going to encourage corporate companies to buy out farming land.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:55):**  I think personally we need to keep people farming and we need to try and get small landowners  
**[1:05:02-1:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:02):**  working together and looking at these nature recovery schemes.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:04):**  And basically I think, and then we could start using the technology that's there.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:10):**  You know, we can use like true technology to measure biodiversity, water storage and  
**[1:05:15-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:15):**  carbon, you know, securitization.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:17):**  And so how do you envision that as a, would it be some kind of, because of course it's  
**[1:05:23-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:23):**  very interesting to get this land, to buy this land or lease it very long-term, but  
**[1:05:28-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:28):**  then there's always this, this little, this, this pressure of speculation, like to sell  
**[1:05:31-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:31):**  it in X years or flip it because, which happens in the real estate because of, and so how  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:38):**  do we counter that?  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:40):**  How do we make sure this is long-term, is that you are able to farm it long-term or  
**[1:05:43-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:43):**  others that are farming with nature and producing food for people?  
**[1:05:47-1:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:47):**  Like how do we make sure that land doesn't become the speculation ball that we just keep  
**[1:05:51-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:51):**  kicking around and people make a lot of money on the transactions?  
**[1:05:54-1:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:54):**  I would say like the more we need to look at how we are going to structure the offsetting.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:02):**  For me, it's pretty, I mean, obviously the winter UK, you know, it's the summer, end  
**[1:06:08-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:08):**  of summer of 2022.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:11):**  It's been incredibly dry.  
**[1:06:14-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:14):**  We know getting incredibly wet winters and we're getting dry summers and especially dry  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:18):**  springs storing water.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:20):**  And I think worldwide storing water is going to be the most important.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:23):**  Instead of draining everything.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:24):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:25):**  You know, bless the beaver folks, I'll tell you, I'm a big beaver, but I think the more  
**[1:06:30-1:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:30):**  we go into the place, so if you, if you, the more organic matter you get, the more carbon  
**[1:06:33-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:33):**  you've got in the soil, the more water you, you hold.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:37):**  So for me, it's almost like water storage is the biggest factor.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:40):**  And so I think working, getting that measured first of all, so you've definitely got, you  
**[1:06:46-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:46):**  know how much water you're storing on your, you know, and if you look in the UK at the  
**[1:06:51-1:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:51):**  moment, the sewage companies are just putting so much sewage into the water, you know, rivers  
**[1:06:55-1:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:55):**  are low and it's just, you know, this Armageddon.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:59):**  Those water companies, I actually worked with South West Water for a bit.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:02):**  They did give me a bit of money to do some fencing, but I totally ignored it because  
**[1:07:05-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:05):**  I wanted to fence in a different way.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:06):**  But it's near and dear to get farmers to hold that water on land, get it clean on land  
**[1:07:10-1:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:10):**  before it goes in.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:11):**  So I think there's a huge, huge opportunity there actually.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:14):**  So water storage.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:16):**  So basically, so I think my idea would be, you know, I was only just sort of thinking  
**[1:07:21-1:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:21):**  about it, I don't know, is get people either long-term leasing or buying land, but if they're  
**[1:07:25-1:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:25):**  buying land, they would be all part of a big pool of people and hopefully they would get  
**[1:07:30-1:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:30):**  money for offsetting, they would be getting money for carbon.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:32):**  There would be the return basically.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:33):**  I would be partly leases, partly small leases and some ecosystem services.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:40):**  I know that I can guarantee that I can make an income for my sheep and it's, you know,  
**[1:07:44-1:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:44):**  I've only just scratched the surface of what's where I can take this.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:48):**  But I then also think I will introduce cows into my system and I think I'll introduce  
**[1:07:52-1:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:52):**  chickens, you know, like, and what I really want to move towards is like motor stores  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:55):**  growing within woodlands.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:56):**  I think that's where the real, that's where we can produce huge amounts of food.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:00):**  So I want to focus on those things, but meanwhile use the willow tit as a way of expanding things  
**[1:08:05-1:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:05):**  because you know, the more they just go where I'm doing stuff with the sheep, there's no  
**[1:08:10-1:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:10):**  willow tit in my uncle's bit, but the willow tits every time you work and it's not big  
**[1:08:14-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:14):**  surprise.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:15):**  It's a canary in the corn mine.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:16):**  Yes, yes.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:17):**  But on the good side of things.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:18):**  Yeah, it's yeah, so yeah, willow tits in the wood, like it's not a big surprise.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:22):**  Nature, like the idea that we have deciduous, I see what happens when you just get deciduous  
**[1:08:26-1:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:26):**  wood without ruminants and it just, the calving comes over and in time it just dies.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:32):**  That's what a lot of the rewilding people taught us.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:35):**  Like it's not like you need management, like it's been managed for centuries and if we  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:40):**  like it or not, we have to take our role as the key certain species and with the managing  
**[1:08:45-1:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:45):**  ruminants and you cannot just put a fence around and let everything out and hope that  
**[1:08:49-1:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:49):**  nature magically reaches some kind of equilibrium.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:52):**  Well, there's quite a few, I mean these are the people who hate me most.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:57):**  So there's a growth of people who, they're just throwing wood throughout and fencing  
**[1:09:01-1:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:01):**  off woodlands.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:02):**  Things are growing and people are treating them like some sort of Messiah, but I'm like  
**[1:09:07-1:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:07):**  mate like people are going to think you're a genius for 20 years, but you're going to  
**[1:09:11-1:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:11):**  die and then 20 years after you're dead, people are going to realise what an idiot you were.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:15):**  And I'm quite, and they're like, they'll get really upset and I say, I'll tell you what,  
**[1:09:20-1:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:20):**  I'll go and take some photos.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:21):**  So I'll pop down and an hour later I'll take the photo.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:23):**  You can just see it like this.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:25):**  It's so weird when you get up.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:26):**  I've thought about like how different managed woodlands, like you could just show it or  
**[1:09:33-1:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:33):**  even listen to it.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:34):**  Like if you just listen to the incredible audio of the two forests or the two woodlands  
**[1:09:39-1:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:39):**  next to each other.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:41):**  And I've seen there was an exhibition by, of course, I forgot the name, but he recorded  
**[1:09:46-1:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:46):**  a lot of nature sounds and projected it on a wall.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:49):**  So you could see, you can not only hear it, but you could see where the Jaguar came in  
**[1:09:54-1:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:54):**  and you could see, because it was another line and it was a fully dark room in Milan.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:58):**  And you could basically, the full wall was of course, very high, really big room.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:02):**  And you could see the sounds coming in and you could hear the difference between a forest  
**[1:10:07-1:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:07):**  that was even selectively cut.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:09):**  Like you could not see the difference.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:11):**  Apparently on pictures, the forest both look equally healthy, but you could hear the difference  
**[1:10:15-1:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:15):**  because it was selectively cut and there was less wildlife.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:18):**  So I think there's something on that sound piece as well.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:21):**  I make it a visual again to see, like we can, you feel the difference immediately when you  
**[1:10:25-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:25):**  walk into there, but probably it's easier to comment on Twitter than it actually is  
**[1:10:28-1:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:28):**  to go and say, okay, let's look at the difference between managed and not managed.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:31):**  I think you're right.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:32):**  It's quite fascinating.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:33):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:34):**  I've got a feeling my mate, Bordie, well, either when I was talking about earlier on,  
**[1:10:37-1:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:37):**  I think he might've sent me that actually.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:40):**  I will send it to you.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:41):**  I will find it, put it in the next below.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:43):**  I'm sorry, I forgot the name.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:44):**  It's a very famous artist for sure, but the nature sound part is so, so you're going to,  
**[1:10:52-1:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:52):**  you have to get to big scale because otherwise you cannot participate in these schemes.  
**[1:10:56-1:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:57):**  And I think for me, I'll keep it out of the corporate hands.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:00):**  Cause we've been farming a long time and like, cause we're like an established family.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:06):**  My granddad was so respected, but my stepdad obviously wasn't.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:08):**  I always say with farming, and I think, I think people, a lot of people are scared about  
**[1:11:13-1:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:13):**  getting into farming and they think they'll be treated.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:15):**  But I always say with farming, and I've proven it to be honest, is if you, if you just, obviously  
**[1:11:22-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:22):**  I do social media, but if you just keep your head down, work hard and pay your bills on  
**[1:11:27-1:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:27):**  time and you're not a twat or you're not like, you know, you're not an idiot.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:32):**  After about three years, people start taking you seriously and it's taken me three years  
**[1:11:36-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:36):**  and now finding people who are actually, okay, he's alright, he pays his bills, you know.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:41):**  I think people are getting locally, I'll be getting to, you know, and I think what's been  
**[1:11:46-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:46):**  very dramatic for me this year is my whole farm has been about giant resistance ever  
**[1:11:53-1:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:53):**  since the inspiration of Steve Gabriel.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:55):**  So the way I farm is that grass grow long, strip graze it, push it down, produce some  
**[1:11:59-1:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:59):**  mulch.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:00):**  And this year, you know, it's just so noticeable.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:04):**  If you drive past my landline, it's literally way, way 10 days ago, everybody else had no  
**[1:12:08-1:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:08):**  grass at all.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:09):**  Their grass is just appearing.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:10):**  Their grass has exploded.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:11):**  And I've got 240 sheep on a very small farm and they've got their no strip grazing and  
**[1:12:16-1:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:16):**  it's just works.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:17):**  It just, you know, so I think no farmer can know, every farmer, you know, you keep such  
**[1:12:23-1:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:23):**  long each other's land.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:24):**  And I've already got a tiny tractor, so I can look over hedges, but all the other farmers  
**[1:12:27-1:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:27):**  have got huge tractors.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:28):**  They can look at mine.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:29):**  It's just, they would have thought really strange seeing these sheep strip grazing,  
**[1:12:33-1:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:33):**  but now it's just so noticeable.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:35):**  I think people locally are beginning to, they will start thinking.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:40):**  I think really he's not like his stepdad, he's like his granddad.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:43):**  And I think as soon as they start thinking now, I think they'll get on the side.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:46):**  And I think this year that's, I would like to think that's happened really.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:50):**  But it will take a lot of work.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:51):**  But the beauty is, because you've got this railway track, it's now all woodland.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:55):**  I don't need to have the land right next to me because if I've got the railway track,  
**[1:12:59-1:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:59):**  I can have a land that's a mile away, but it will still be connected.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:01):**  But I can, like, connect it.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:02):**  And the same with the River Kerry.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:05):**  So I think that's how, so I don't need to worry too much about the land right next to  
**[1:13:08-1:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:08):**  me.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:09):**  So that's, that's, could be another.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:12):**  Is it somewhere connected to the archery basically?  
**[1:13:14-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:15):**  And it was just being, if you plant the rice mulch tree, between me, well, I said between  
**[1:13:18-1:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:18):**  me and you.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:19):**  There are a few other people listening.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:21):**  When I actually walked down the track and there's a land about a mile away, I actually  
**[1:13:25-1:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:25):**  saw a willow tit in there.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:26):**  So they're obviously already using it.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:28):**  Like, you know, it's like, it's just already, you know, like, I wasn't going to tell anybody  
**[1:13:33-1:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:33):**  that.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:34):**  But I think it's.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:36):**  Maybe it was the other one.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:37):**  Maybe you didn't see it correctly.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:38):**  But the other thing I think in terms of investments, which I don't know why people.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:45):**  So what would you tell investors?  
**[1:13:46-1:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:46):**  Let's say we're not in the Oxford, the farming conference, which would be fun, but we're  
**[1:13:50-1:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:50):**  on stage at, actually there's an upcoming one.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:54):**  Probably it's out when this is way out after that.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:56):**  But in Amsterdam, we're sitting on stage, a lot of bankers, investors, family officers,  
**[1:14:00-1:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:00):**  et cetera, that are excited to follow you on Instagram or other people.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:04):**  And what would you tell them?  
**[1:14:06-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:06):**  Obviously without giving investment advice, but where to look and how potentially to put  
**[1:14:10-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:10):**  money to work?  
**[1:14:11-1:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:11):**  Well, I'd say firstly, I look at the economic press, actually the financial press, and I  
**[1:14:16-1:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:16):**  have to say, I think the standard journalism is pretty dreadful.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:20):**  That's why we're recording this podcast.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:22):**  It's just, they just rehash press releases.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:25):**  It just drives me wild.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:27):**  Like yesterday I saw something about you need to invest in proteins.  
**[1:14:30-1:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:30):**  What I'd say is, if you don't want to invest in, if you don't think Regen Aguero is right,  
**[1:14:36-1:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:36):**  then invest your money in alternative proteins, but also invest in the pharmaceutical industry  
**[1:14:41-1:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:41):**  because one is going to lead to, and it's just fat.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:43):**  If you eat the sludge that they're proposing you eat, then you're going to need pharmaceuticals.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:49):**  So those two go together.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:50):**  If you're not going to do that.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:52):**  Basically if you invest in that, you're creating a market for your pharmaceutical investments,  
**[1:14:56-1:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:56):**  which is a fair strategy.  
**[1:14:58-1:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:58):**  Yeah, it's brilliant.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:59):**  So good luck to you.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:01):**  But if you actually like humanity-  
**[1:15:03-1:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:03):**  Don't call Matt.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:04):**  No, what they was talking about is, they're talking about the vegan, you know, the growth  
**[1:15:10-1:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:10):**  in vegan people.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:11):**  I think what's becoming very obvious, that without government intervention, without raising  
**[1:15:14-1:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:14):**  taxes for meat, lockdowns are proving that very few of the population are into the alternative  
**[1:15:22-1:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:22):**  meats, the beyond burgers, the impossible meats, those sorts of things.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:26):**  So at any one time, about one to 2% of the population are vegan.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:32):**  The vegan did their own research six years ago.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:35):**  They never talked about it, but they did their own research.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:38):**  And it shows that 84% of vegans give up after one year.  
**[1:15:42-1:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:42):**  And I did some rough sums.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:44):**  So at any one time, so 1% of the population, say the population of the UK is 60 million,  
**[1:15:50-1:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:50):**  it's probably 1 million vegans at any one time.  
**[1:15:54-1:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:54):**  A year later, about, well, 840,000 of those will be ex-vegans.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:00):**  So I reckon there's probably in the UK now about 10 million ex-vegans.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:03):**  I think those people are wonderful.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:06):**  They obviously care about the planet.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:08):**  They do care about sentient beings, but they've gone through the process where they're realizing  
**[1:16:12-1:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:12):**  that actually being on the vegan diet is, for some reason, they've given up, haven't  
**[1:16:16-1:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:16):**  they?  
**[1:16:17-1:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:17):**  That market is the one that I, they're the ones buying all my private sales because they're  
**[1:16:22-1:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:22):**  looking for incredibly ethical farming systems.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:26):**  So I would say focus on that.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:28):**  No one's really talking about it, I haven't heard anybody talk about it, but that's the  
**[1:16:31-1:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:31):**  fastest growing, most ethical market in the UK.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:35):**  And they don't have to eat meat, but I do think it's obvious to me that you need animal  
**[1:16:39-1:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:39):**  fats of some sort.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:41):**  So I would personally, where I would invest a lot of money is...  
**[1:16:47-1:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:47):**  That's my perfect next question.  
**[1:16:48-1:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:48):**  What would you do?  
**[1:16:49-1:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:49):**  Like you would fork like a billion dollar, a billion pounds, surely.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:52):**  Like what would you, how would you put it to work?  
**[1:16:54-1:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:54):**  I would get Jersey cows, I would basically, arable is where we can make the most change.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:02):**  Where we're farming now, we can produce really incredibly healthy livestock.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:07):**  We can produce really healthy Jersey cows, for example.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:10):**  What you need to do, we need to start basically, at the moment all our farming systems are  
**[1:17:15-1:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:15):**  separate, dairy, highland, arable.  
**[1:17:19-1:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:19):**  And it's not rocket science, it's what they used to do.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:21):**  So where I would put huge money in is mobile dairy units on arable systems.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:26):**  And I would, and it's happening in Germany, there's lots of systems now.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:29):**  But to me, if you can make the dairy part of the arable system, so you do the Dried  
**[1:17:35-1:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:35):**  Grain Aggy glazing a cow, you've got a mobile system.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:38):**  And then to me, you can then start measuring that milk.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:42):**  And I'm sure from a regenerative system, it would be so, so good for you.  
**[1:17:46-1:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:46):**  The cattle are outside, maybe you need to work on the...  
**[1:17:50-1:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:50):**  Would you then do your arable system in a permanent pasture way?  
**[1:17:54-1:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:54):**  I mean, the wild farming people, and how do you make sure there is not just leftover from  
**[1:17:59-1:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:59):**  whatever they were growing?  
**[1:18:00-1:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:00):**  How do you make sure the cows get their...  
**[1:18:02-1:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:02):**  My friends of mine have got a 800 acre arable farm in Hertfordshire.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:07):**  We're slowly beginning to work on getting sheep as part of the system.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:10):**  But you imagine, at any one time, you probably want to do arable for three years, and you  
**[1:18:13-1:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:13):**  want to graze for three years.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:16):**  So you basically, if you work down that farm...  
**[1:18:18-1:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:18):**  Basically as a separate, as part of the rotation, not necessarily grazing the arable.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:22):**  Yeah, not grazing the arable.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:23):**  So basically, you need to have your herbal legs, whatever you do, to get that soil working.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:31):**  You need cattle to do that.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:33):**  You need to cover crops.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:34):**  Yeah, you need to cover crops, get that working, have a mobile farming system.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:37):**  So you're then protecting the milk.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:41):**  And they're basically regenerating the land.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:42):**  You don't need to use fertiliser.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:44):**  And those animals, it can be...  
**[1:18:46-1:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:46):**  If they're the right animals, I think they need to move away from fusion in the host  
**[1:18:49-1:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:49):**  arm.  
**[1:18:50-1:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:50):**  We need to move towards Jersey cattle.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:52):**  They're just more...  
**[1:18:53-1:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:53):**  They're able to turn that product into something that's just incredible.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:58):**  I love fusion, so I grew up with it.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:01):**  I probably love them a lot more than I love sheep.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:04):**  But I think they don't fit.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:05):**  As an animal, we need to go back to the animals that can turn all of that, what's growing.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:11):**  And that's why we do need to start looking towards that.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:14):**  If you're going to raise cattle on those systems, like the red room, so herifers, that sort  
**[1:19:19-1:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:19):**  of thing.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:20):**  So basically, I've got a friend who is called Fred Price.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:25):**  And he really wanted to interview Fred.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:27):**  Fred's just a genius guy, probably, I think, early 30s.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:31):**  Went to Oxford, Cambridge.  
**[1:19:32-1:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:32):**  His folks had a 200 acre arable farm.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:34):**  He went to Oxford and Cambridge, came back and went to the farm.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:37):**  His parents were horrified.  
**[1:19:38-1:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:38):**  But he basically became like the...  
**[1:19:40-1:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:40):**  They sent him there, and then he came back.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:43):**  But he basically became the best chemical farmer.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:46):**  He was using chemicals.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:48):**  His yield was going up, but he was spending more and more money.  
**[1:19:51-1:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:51):**  And then one year, everything just crashed, like yield crashed.  
**[1:19:54-1:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:54):**  And he was the best person to talk to that I ever had to talk about this.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:58):**  But also, it's happening worldwide now where your soil just can't do that chemical process  
**[1:20:01-1:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:01):**  where it just...  
**[1:20:02-1:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:02):**  It doesn't matter how much nitrogen you put on, the soil is done.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:06):**  So then what he then started doing was planting herbal lice.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:09):**  He gets Tamworth pigs.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:11):**  And he now, we help him, we help his supply chain.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:15):**  So we move him up, which we set him up in a restaurant in London.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:17):**  They boil his Tamworths.  
**[1:20:20-1:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:20):**  But now he's like five years in.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:23):**  It has to be seen to believe.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:25):**  His pigs are basically his input.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:27):**  So he's making money on his input.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:28):**  And he's now producing like heritage world class grains.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:31):**  And he is part of that sourdough cool East London thing.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:34):**  So perhaps I shouldn't stack them up too much.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:36):**  I just...  
**[1:20:37-1:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:37):**  Like a good slice of bread with some interesting butter, some interesting baking.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:40):**  I mean, it's part of it, but it shouldn't only be that fermentation like we learned  
**[1:20:46-1:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:46):**  happens in ruminants, which is important.  
**[1:20:48-1:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:48):**  But I did some sums.  
**[1:20:49-1:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:49):**  And this is the exact...  
**[1:20:50-1:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:50):**  Actually, I have friends in Northern Ireland who got in touch with me about three years  
**[1:20:53-1:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:53):**  ago.  
**[1:20:54-1:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:54):**  They wanted to talk about something.  
**[1:20:55-1:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:55):**  So I did some sums for them.  
**[1:20:58-1:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:58):**  And the most...  
**[1:20:59-1:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:59):**  This needs to go to the economists out there.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:01):**  Obviously, you need to take me...  
**[1:21:02-1:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:02):**  I wouldn't say the pinch of salt, but I looked at how many pigs Fred was producing from his  
**[1:21:08-1:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:08):**  land.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:09):**  And then at the moment, we've got 9 million pigs in factories, which I have hauled.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:15):**  And it's got...  
**[1:21:16-1:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:16):**  That's...  
**[1:21:17-1:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:17):**  But if 20% of arable farmers in the UK did what Fred did and used pigs as part of their  
**[1:21:25-1:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:25):**  rotation, then those 9 million pigs could be taken from factories and put on land.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:31):**  And then I think in time, you're going to realize that because he's not paying for chemicals,  
**[1:21:35-1:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:35):**  pigs are his chemical.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:36):**  They're always fertilizer.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:38):**  He's actually making money from his input.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:40):**  So in time, I think...  
**[1:21:42-1:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:42):**  Making money from your input.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:43):**  It's a...  
**[1:21:44-1:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:44):**  I mean, yeah.  
**[1:21:45-1:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:45):**  That's the one...  
**[1:21:46-1:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:46):**  I wouldn't say one of the tricks, but how do you switch that conversation to how do  
**[1:21:53-1:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:53):**  you grow as much food for people without all the inputs or actually make money from inputs,  
**[1:21:59-1:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:59):**  which is the ruminant or the pig?  
**[1:22:02-1:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:02):**  But that's such a mental flip that you have to see it to believe it and then do the numbers  
**[1:22:06-1:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:06):**  and then still probably many people would say, no, it's impossible.  
**[1:22:09-1:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:09):**  It sounds so good to be true.  
**[1:22:10-1:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:10):**  Think about it.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:11):**  I think we've talked about this.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:12):**  Even a funny flip is what we say down here is, I want to try and talk the farmer's language  
**[1:22:17-1:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:17):**  and the whole regen thing.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:19):**  Like farmers down here, they just raise their eyebrows.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:21):**  And so what we think is...  
**[1:22:23-1:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:23):**  I think at the moment I'm regenerating my land.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:24):**  I think my granddad did these things.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:26):**  My stepdad did even worse.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:28):**  I'm now using the sheep to regenerate it.  
**[1:22:29-1:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:29):**  But once it's regenerated, when it's working, I'm then moving to low input farming.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:33):**  So basically spending as little as you can, unless you spend, unless you need to make.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:39):**  But now it's only thinking like, you could be a high input, but the pigs, because you've  
**[1:22:47-1:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:47):**  got pigs on it, it's actually a high input, but it's just not one that you're paying for.  
**[1:22:51-1:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:51):**  Do you know what I mean?  
**[1:22:53-1:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:53):**  We're talking about a low input system, but actually, so at the moment I've got 240 sheep.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:58):**  It looks like too many, but they're every day, they're quite big.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:03):**  They're probably pulling out six kilos of poo a day.  
**[1:23:06-1:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:23:07-1:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:07):**  So the input, but of course the input doesn't come from outside your farm gate, which you  
**[1:23:10-1:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:10):**  didn't put.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:11):**  But I think that's the...  
**[1:23:13-1:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:13):**  We forget that in agriculture, if you run it like a business, we would never ask that  
**[1:23:17-1:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:17):**  question to a bike factory.  
**[1:23:19-1:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:19):**  I have said it on the podcast, people are not going to say, yeah, you already mentioned  
**[1:23:21-1:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:21):**  it.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:22):**  But you would never ask the question, can you squeeze out as many bikes?  
**[1:23:25-1:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:25):**  It doesn't matter your input cost.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:27):**  It doesn't matter your labor costs.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:28):**  It doesn't matter if you have to run 24 seven, whatever diesel generator you have to put  
**[1:23:31-1:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:31):**  on.  
**[1:23:32-1:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:32):**  Like we only want to know your output.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:34):**  And somehow in farming, like the number of bikes and bikes, and somehow in farming, we  
**[1:23:39-1:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:39):**  always ask only that question.  
**[1:23:40-1:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:40):**  We never ask, but actually what did it cost to produce this and how far did it come from  
**[1:23:44-1:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:44):**  or the environmental cost, the financial cost, just the issue of having all these lorries  
**[1:23:49-1:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:49):**  come on your land to bring stuff and then you have to get on your big tractor to ride  
**[1:23:55-1:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:55):**  it out.  
**[1:23:56-1:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:56):**  Like it is input and output and we never talk about the input.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:59):**  We never talk about the output, which is ridiculous from an environmental and from an economic  
**[1:24:03-1:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:03):**  perspective.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:04):**  Yeah.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:05):**  And apparently you run systems, you are able in general, you, the general you that are  
**[1:24:10-1:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:10):**  way less input or even zero with really good and amazing output that we are find difficult  
**[1:24:15-1:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:15):**  to believe and does really good margins.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:17):**  I mean, when I started three years ago, I wouldn't dare have more than like a hundred  
**[1:24:25-1:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:25):**  sheep, strict grazing.  
**[1:24:27-1:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:27):**  Which is interesting and you're like this whole feeding the world thing.  
**[1:24:30-1:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:30):**  Like there's a limit.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:31):**  It's like we say much land is under stocked and overgrazed, but it turns out to be really  
**[1:24:37-1:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:37):**  true.  
**[1:24:38-1:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:38):**  Like there's so much more possible than...  
**[1:24:39-1:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:39):**  I've now got 240 sheep and I'm actually, and that's after a drought, I can actually go  
**[1:24:44-1:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:44):**  up by another 60.  
**[1:24:45-1:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:45):**  Like my land, I think there's some questions you asked me before and one of the questions  
**[1:24:51-1:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:51):**  I, one of the things I want to change the most is a either journalist...  
**[1:24:57-1:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:57):**  You're really like bringing up every question I want to ask.  
**[1:24:59-1:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:59):**  It's amazing.  
**[1:25:00-1:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:00):**  You're doing my job.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:01):**  Like what would you change?  
**[1:25:02-1:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:02):**  Great question, Matt.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:03):**  Thank you for this.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:04):**  It's going to be my final one because I was starting to approach the, I think the longest  
**[1:25:09-1:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:09):**  interview I ever did, but it's absolutely fascinating.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:11):**  So thank you for making it until now.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:13):**  If you're still listening, what would you love to change?  
**[1:25:15-1:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:15):**  There's two things.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:16):**  One is either not just the journalist and the economic press, but journalists either  
**[1:25:21-1:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:21):**  need to sort themselves out and actually start thinking critically rather than leading press  
**[1:25:26-1:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:26):**  releases because, or we just need to ignore mainstream media because they're just, they're  
**[1:25:30-1:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:30):**  just at the moment, journalism's gone very wrong and they're just, they're so like obsessed  
**[1:25:36-1:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:36):**  with where they are in the, you know, like, and when I see in the food industry, you know,  
**[1:25:40-1:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:40):**  bless them, some of friends and they know I say things like this, but you still need  
**[1:25:44-1:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:44):**  to start getting on board, you need to think critically about everything you're told.  
**[1:25:49-1:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:49):**  So on that point, you know, so if the journalists aren't going to sort this stuff out, you just  
**[1:25:54-1:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:54):**  need to start looking elsewhere for information.  
**[1:25:55-1:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:55):**  But the thing is what's happening at the moment with farming and everywhere is everyone's  
**[1:25:59-1:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:59):**  talking about peer reviewed things.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:00):**  Like, so I'll, I, you need to start.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:01):**  Where is the peer reviewed papers?  
**[1:26:02-1:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:02):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:03):**  It's all the time.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:04):**  Where's that peer reviewed?  
**[1:26:05-1:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:05):**  I'm like, mate, like, you're not being weird.  
**[1:26:06-1:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:06):**  I've got six months going and that one I've got 140.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:07):**  They said, no, but I need to get statistical data.  
**[1:26:08-1:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:08):**  I'm like, mate, like, this is the worst thing I've ever done.  
**[1:26:09-1:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:09):**  I'm like, I'm not going to do this.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:10):**  I'm not going to do this.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:11):**  I need to get statistical data on like, like, like, here's a photo.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:15):**  Go with two people, look at each other.  
**[1:26:17-1:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:17):**  You are your peers, you're reviewing and look at the difference.  
**[1:26:20-1:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:20):**  So I think like, we've got to stop.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:23):**  I think we do actually need to listen to farmers.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:26):**  We need to trust the judgement of what farmers are seeing with their own eyes.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:29):**  And if they take a photo, you know, like, and I mean, I've just taken bank statements  
**[1:26:33-1:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:33):**  in mind, but we need, you need to start realising that farmers, all we actually want to do is  
**[1:26:37-1:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:37):**  feed people and actually earn enough money to live.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:39):**  Like we're not like, we don't actually want to destroy the planet.  
**[1:26:42-1:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:42):**  Like, like start working with us and trusting us because like, I, you know, I sit there,  
**[1:26:48-1:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:48):**  I'm probably four or five hours a day just watching my land and walking looking and like,  
**[1:26:52-1:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:52):**  no one knows that better than like, I know that I know what's going on.  
**[1:26:56-1:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:56):**  So start, start trusting what farmers are saying.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:00):**  And one thing I would say is my granddad was told to feed the nation and he did it.  
**[1:27:05-1:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:05):**  And within two years he turned the farmer out.  
**[1:27:08-1:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:08):**  Farmers are capable of changing things incredibly quickly, like if they need to and everyone's  
**[1:27:12-1:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:12):**  onside, like farmers can do it, but we need to agree on, we need to agree on how much  
**[1:27:19-1:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:19):**  carbon are we storing in soils?  
**[1:27:21-1:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:21):**  Because that's the base thing at the moment.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:23):**  One science says, one people are saying, he doesn't store much carbon, you only put it  
**[1:27:27-1:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:27):**  so deep.  
**[1:27:28-1:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:28):**  And other people, other scientists are saying we're storing loads.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:30):**  We need to get that right.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:32):**  Plus, are we, are everyone actually storing carbon?  
**[1:27:36-1:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:36):**  How much are they storing?  
**[1:27:37-1:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:37):**  Can we agree that if they're not, we'll get rid of them, we'll eat fake meat.  
**[1:27:42-1:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:42):**  But if we are, if that's how we want to get carbon from up there down the ground, we need  
**[1:27:46-1:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:46):**  to then work out how to do that.  
**[1:27:49-1:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:49):**  Hope that answers that.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:50):**  And how does that, because you mentioned before the water piece is almost more interesting  
**[1:27:54-1:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:54):**  or more, seems to be easier to measure, like water holding capacity.  
**[1:28:00-1:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:00):**  You see all these great videos on YouTube and Instagram of very dry land, recently grazed  
**[1:28:04-1:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:04):**  land, like a cup of water upside down, see how fast it goes in.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:07):**  I mean, that's, you don't need a peer review paper for that.  
**[1:28:10-1:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:10):**  Anybody can see what's your, at least what's your infiltration rate is very easy to do.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:14):**  Like, do you see that as a, as an easier in than all this fluffy carbon talk?  
**[1:28:19-1:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:19):**  I think, I think it's, I mean, there is no drone technology where they can measure, they  
**[1:28:24-1:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:24):**  can send things up.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:25):**  I think these things are actually all incredibly measurable now.  
**[1:28:31-1:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:31):**  But this is.  
**[1:28:32-1:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:32):**  They are.  
**[1:28:33-1:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:33):**  So the infiltration, the vegetation, you can see quite a lot.  
**[1:28:38-1:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:38):**  I like, so my granddad, I literally had a talk last week, there's a guy who's quite  
**[1:28:43-1:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:43):**  home, George Monbiot, I had a bit of a blow up last week.  
**[1:28:46-1:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:46):**  There's another cat called, a guy who, you know, they may be lovely people, but I'm not  
**[1:28:52-1:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:52):**  a big fan.  
**[1:28:53-1:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:53):**  Anyway, they start talking to me and all these people just piled in and started to go at  
**[1:28:56-1:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:56):**  me and they're like, mate, how'd you know you're holding more water?  
**[1:28:59-1:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:59):**  You know?  
**[1:29:00-1:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:00):**  And I'm like, well, I just, I walk every bit of land every day.  
**[1:29:02-1:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:02):**  Like I know, but I said also my granddad put these drainage pipes in.  
**[1:29:07-1:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:07):**  When I started in the winter, they would all, all the water would rain and it would all  
**[1:29:11-1:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:11):**  come out.  
**[1:29:12-1:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:12):**  You know, I can see it.  
**[1:29:13-1:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:13):**  But now after three years, like every year, less and less and less and less, like, you  
**[1:29:17-1:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:17):**  know, like, it's not coming off there.  
**[1:29:24-1:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:24):**  It's staying on that.  
**[1:29:25-1:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:25):**  Like, you know, believe me if you want, but like, I'm telling you, that's, it's obvious  
**[1:29:30-1:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:30):**  to my land.  
**[1:29:31-1:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:31):**  So they say for every percentage increase in organic matter, you hold 20,000.  
**[1:29:35-1:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:35):**  I'll show you photos.  
**[1:29:36-1:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:36):**  We had like 20,000 more litres and it's just true.  
**[1:29:40-1:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:40):**  Like you were there three years and I've done nothing that no one else can do.  
**[1:29:43-1:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:43):**  All I've done is strip graze sheep.  
**[1:29:45-1:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:45):**  That's all I've done.  
**[1:29:46-1:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:46):**  Nothing, you know, now we've got electric fence.  
**[1:29:49-1:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:49):**  I've done nothing on my farm that no one else in the whole country can do.  
**[1:29:54-1:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:54):**  But the man of war is now holding and it's obvious from the start, you know, my roots  
**[1:30:00-1:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:00):**  are still getting that water that was drained, you know, the total surface is dry, but they're  
**[1:30:04-1:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:04):**  getting, you know, like it's just, you know,  
**[1:30:07-1:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:07):**  You're getting funkels now, your neighbours, like are they, I mean, they, they, they look  
**[1:30:10-1:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:10):**  over the fence, over the hedgerows with, on the big tractors, but are they, are they starting  
**[1:30:14-1:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:14):**  to knock your door?  
**[1:30:15-1:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:15):**  Like, we thought you were crazy, but your grass looks amazing.  
**[1:30:18-1:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:18):**  I have started seeing, there's a dairy farm offset and they've started strip grazing their  
**[1:30:23-1:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:23):**  dairy cows and I've never seen that in like 40 years.  
**[1:30:27-1:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:27):**  So yeah, it's quite interesting.  
**[1:30:29-1:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:29):**  There's a satellite picture of, I think it's March Shepherd's farm from above, obviously.  
**[1:30:34-1:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:34):**  And you can see which neighbours have started putting key line design in.  
**[1:30:38-1:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:38):**  It's amazing.  
**[1:30:39-1:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:39):**  You can see, you see his farm and then you see the others and you see where it stops  
**[1:30:43-1:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:43):**  like exactly and everything is straight again.  
**[1:30:45-1:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:45):**  And then you see these really nice curves.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:47):**  And so you can see the spread almost.  
**[1:30:49-1:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:49):**  And of course, if you talk to him, you would know exactly which ones are where and how,  
**[1:30:53-1:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:53):**  et cetera.  
**[1:30:54-1:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:54):**  But you can see this impact probably on yours as well.  
**[1:30:55-1:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:55):**  You could see over the next years, you can see how it is like the greener grass and the  
**[1:31:01-1:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:01):**  better growth grass because that all you can measure from satellite pictures.  
**[1:31:03-1:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:03):**  That's not so difficult.  
**[1:31:04-1:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:04):**  What would be more interesting is, so I used to play cricket.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:07):**  I don't know where you are cricket, but like I used to play for my local side 30 years  
**[1:31:13-1:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:13):**  ago and for 25 years I was in London.  
**[1:31:16-1:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:16):**  I then came back and started playing for three years ago and they're all sheep farmers and  
**[1:31:21-1:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:21):**  they like put up with me for three years.  
**[1:31:23-1:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:23):**  They actually, they, you know, they see my Instagram, they call me like the Instagram  
**[1:31:27-1:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:27):**  farmer, but they actually, I did an event on my wood.  
**[1:31:31-1:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:31):**  Like an American company came over to the bank and there was some tickets.  
**[1:31:34-1:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:34):**  I invited some of the cricket guys along and genuinely like they were blown away.  
**[1:31:40-1:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:40):**  Like they just, I mean, this is the bit I can, I've had chefs like that.  
**[1:31:46-1:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:46):**  I can get anybody who doesn't know farming to come to my land and if I want to, I can  
**[1:31:50-1:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:50):**  get them thinking I'm a genius and the best farmer in the world.  
**[1:31:52-1:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:52):**  But it's not true.  
**[1:31:53-1:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:53):**  But your neighbour farmers and your cricket mates are different.  
**[1:31:56-1:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:31:57-1:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:57):**  Within a nanosecond, by the time they parked their cars and walked towards me, they already  
**[1:32:00-1:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:00):**  knew if I was a poultry or not.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:01):**  You know, they just, it's like, is he making money?  
**[1:32:03-1:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:03):**  Is that, you know, and I had so much grass and I was doing it so differently and like  
**[1:32:08-1:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:08):**  the bits and their grasses stopped growing by then and I, cause I had, you know, it was  
**[1:32:12-1:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:12):**  just all day and one of them was so, I don't think I really think about it.  
**[1:32:16-1:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:16):**  The next day I was also cutting hay and the guy said, you know how much, you know, he  
**[1:32:21-1:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:21):**  actually very kindly got his mate to bail it all out and we got a really good yield  
**[1:32:25-1:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:25):**  on my hay and he just said something so nice on, you know, basically like, you know, mate  
**[1:32:30-1:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:30):**  actually you're a pretty good farmer.  
**[1:32:31-1:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:31):**  That was all it took.  
**[1:32:32-1:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:32):**  Obviously I feel emotional.  
**[1:32:33-1:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:33):**  That's all it took was him, like an actual farmer to go actually mate, like, you're pretty  
**[1:32:38-1:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:38):**  good.  
**[1:32:39-1:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:39):**  Like it was like.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:40):**  The imposter syndrome was solved.  
**[1:32:41-1:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:41):**  Yeah.  
**[1:32:42-1:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:42):**  But to be honest, I sort of, I know it sounds cocky, but I just know it's working.  
**[1:32:48-1:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:48):**  You know what I mean?  
**[1:32:49-1:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:49):**  It was lovely to hear from them, but I sort of, you know, when I was doing the restaurants  
**[1:32:55-1:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:55):**  and chefs, I knew it was bullshit.  
**[1:32:56-1:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:56):**  I knew it was nonsense.  
**[1:32:57-1:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:57):**  Like, you know, I knew how good I was.  
**[1:32:58-1:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:58):**  It wasn't very good, but this, I just, I'm not saying I could be good on another farm,  
**[1:33:04-1:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:04):**  but on my family farm, I know I couldn't be, I couldn't be trying harder to be better.  
**[1:33:10-1:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:10):**  You know, I just, if I went to another farm, who knows, I'd probably cock it up.  
**[1:33:15-1:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:15):**  We'll see that now with the railway lines.  
**[1:33:16-1:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:16):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:33:17-1:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:17):**  I don't know how that's going to go.  
**[1:33:19-1:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:19):**  I want to thank you so much for your time, Matt, to come on.  
**[1:33:22-1:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:22):**  I mean, you have a lot to do.  
**[1:33:23-1:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:23):**  Like you need to spend another four or five hours today looking at your land, which is  
**[1:33:26-1:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:26):**  very important.  
**[1:33:27-1:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:27):**  I'm not making a joke here.  
**[1:33:28-1:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:28):**  I'm not being cynical.  
**[1:33:29-1:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:29):**  It's fundamental because that observation leads to, I mean, the results and the flavor  
**[1:33:35-1:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:35):**  we just heard about, but I want to thank you so much for coming on.  
**[1:33:38-1:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:38):**  I don't think it's going to be the last time.  
**[1:33:40-1:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:40):**  I really enjoyed it.  
**[1:33:41-1:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:41):**  It's probably the longest interview we ever did, but with really good reasons and so many  
**[1:33:45-1:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:45):**  other rabbit holes to unpack.  
**[1:33:46-1:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:46):**  So I want to thank you for now.  
**[1:33:48-1:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:48):**  I will put all the links below of your social media for people to follow, to come and visit,  
**[1:33:53-1:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:53):**  to see what's possible and to taste what's possible and to understand and to listen to  
**[1:33:59-1:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:59):**  farmers because they are the only ones that really know the land.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:34:02):**  So thank you so much for your time, for all that you do and for taking the time to come  
**[1:34:05-1:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:34:05):**  here and share your story.

**[1:34:57-1:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:34:57):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:35:01-1:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:01):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:05):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:35:07-1:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:07):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:35:11-1:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:11):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:35:16-1:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:16):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:35:21-1:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:21):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[1:35:40-1:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:40):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:35:41-1:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:41):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:35:44-1:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:44):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:35:48-1:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:48):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[1:35:53-1:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:53):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:35:58-1:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:58):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:36:01-1:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:01):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:36:04-1:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:04):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:36:08-1:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:08):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:13):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:36:14-1:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:14):**  No.  
**[1:36:15-1:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:15):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:36:18-1:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:18):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:36:23-1:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:23):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:36:27-1:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:27):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:36:32-1:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:32):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:36:35-1:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:35):**  Thank you.  
**[1:36:36-1:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:36):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:36:37-1:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:37):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:36:44-1:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:44):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:36:46-1:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:46):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:36:51-1:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:51):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:36:56-1:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:56):**  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:37:01-1:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:01):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:37:03-1:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:03):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:37:07-1:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:07):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:37:11-1:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:11):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:37:16-1:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:16):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:37:17-1:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:17):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:37:19-1:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:19):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:22):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:25):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:37:27-1:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:27):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:37:32-1:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:32):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

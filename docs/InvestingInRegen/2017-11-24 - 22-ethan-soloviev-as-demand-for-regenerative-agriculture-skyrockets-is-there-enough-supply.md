**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:31):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:40):**  In these interviews I'm talking to people who are scaling up the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:44):**  sector, either by increasing the inflow of investment capital or by scaling up the enterprises  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:50):**  on and in the ground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:51):**  And by doing so, exploring what it means to be an impact investor in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:56):**  Why am I focused on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:01:59):**  Because the roots of so many of the issues we're facing in the world today can be found  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:03):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:04):**  From droughts, migrant flows, obesities, social issues, water wars, climate change,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:10):**  hunger, they all have a connection to how we treat the land, grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:14):**  I hope you will enjoy this interview as much as I did making it.

**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:29):**  We talked about how some consumer companies are taking the lead like Dr. Bronner's in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:33):**  Patagonia.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:34):**  And how the awareness for regenerative agriculture has grown so much in the last year and keeps  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:38):**  growing and what the demand for regenerative ingredients from cosmetic companies actually  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:43):**  means for farmers.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:45):**  Plus a lot more.

**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:47):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:49):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host, and in the podcast of today I'm joined by Ethan Soloviev.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:54):**  Ethan is an international expert on regenerative agriculture, a farmer, a writer and the vice  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:02:58):**  president of research at Howgood.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:00):**  He's the author of Regenerative Enterprise, Regenerative Agriculture Redefined and the  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:04):**  levels of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:06):**  As an international consultant and speaker, Ethan has helped design and fund more than  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:09):**  3000 acres of regenerative agriculture in 34 countries.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:13):**  He and his family farm have diversified 32 acres in New York, producing apples, sheep,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:17):**  mushrooms, eggs and specialty crops.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:19):**  Welcome Ethan.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:20):**  Thank you, glad to be here.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:22):**  So to ask a personal question which I love to start with, because many people I interview  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:28):**  in this podcast series could be doing something else.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:30):**  They're coming from big banks, they come from big farms, they come from completely different  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:34):**  sectors, but they end up in the regenerative agriculture sector.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:37):**  For you, how did you end up in the regenerative agriculture sector and what's your passion  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:42):**  that got you here?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:43):**  Some of my earliest memories are actually climbing in an apple tree in the backyard  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:48):**  of my house.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:49):**  And now you're running a diversified apple farm.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:51):**  It was a long route to get here.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:03:54):**  I studied biochemistry in college and was in the laboratory and on computers and by  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:00):**  the end of university I wanted something totally different.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:04):**  I had a biology degree in my hand, but I had never studied anything bigger than a fruit  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:09):**  fly.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:10):**  And so I went out for and received this fellowship that provided for a year of travel and research  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:18):**  focused on apples.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:21):**  And so I studied in Sweden, Kazakhstan, Japan, New Zealand, Chile, looking at the global  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:27):**  diversity of apples all over the world, the genetic diversity at a biochemical level,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:32):**  the food diversity, how different people cook and eat and drink apples, and the agricultural  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:38):**  diversity, the difference in growing in all different places.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:42):**  Along the way I was terminally infected with permaculture in New Zealand and when I got  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:51):**  back to my home after a year of travel, I took a permaculture design course and dove  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:58):**  right in.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:04:59):**  I started a permaculture consulting firm doing ecological sustainable design work starting  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:06):**  at a small scale but then building up until we were doing 100 acre, 200 acre, 300 acre  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:12):**  farms integrated with developments and really just always looking for what I thought at  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:19):**  that point was the leverage point where I could do a little bit of work and produce  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:24):**  a huge amount of change for the world.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:26):**  And what was that leverage point at that point?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:32):**  I thought at that point it was going to be doing designs and helping people turn their  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:37):**  land into productive regenerative landscapes.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:42):**  But what I figured out is that as a consultant I could only work with a handful of clients  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:47):**  a year and the changes that we were helping them make on their landscape were good but  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:53):**  nobody was fundamentally changing how they produce their income.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:05:59):**  Nobody was fundamentally working on the bigger systemic issues.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:04):**  They were more making cool landscapes that produce food and that's great.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:08):**  I think that's a really good idea.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:09):**  I think the permaculture movement has been moderately effective at doing that around  
**[0:06:14-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:14):**  the world but I started looking for something bigger, something more effective and through  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:22):**  the work of TerraGenesis International which is a consulting firm that I helped to found,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:28):**  we started to look at supply, at the larger systems of supply in the world, what people  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:34):**  usually call a supply chain.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:35):**  How do big companies, say a chocolate company, get all of their different components together  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:40):**  to their manufacturing from all over the world, from all these different places and then produce  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:45):**  their products.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:46):**  So we realized that if we could influence businesses who had especially complex global  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:06:54):**  supplies, then they could start sourcing from regenerative agriculture and investing into  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:03):**  regenerative agriculture systems around the world where they source their materials from  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:07):**  and that that would all of a sudden have a much larger impact than working for individuals.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:12):**  So that was a real shift and now I'm coming at it from a couple different angles but still  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:21):**  the core of what I'm aiming to do and why I'm aiming to do it is I'm seeking to transform  
**[0:07:28-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:28):**  supply, how the global system of supply works and I've got to come at it from multiple different  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:36):**  angles.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:37):**  I kind of think of this as three legs of a stool.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:41):**  The first leg is really working on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:46):**  What does that actually mean?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:47):**  What are the different levels of regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:50):**  How do you go from just starting out?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:52):**  How do you go from a chemical intensive, industrial, agriculture, degenerative, destructive system  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:57):**  and transition?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:07:58):**  I'm also working on the investment side of things and thinking about how do we help businesses  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:05):**  choose to shift to invest into regenerative supply and then what is the role of equity,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:12):**  private equity, public equity financing in helping farms transform.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:18):**  And then the third kind of leg of the stool is actually looking at the will of the marketplace  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:23):**  and how is it that individual human beings all over the planet make the right choices  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:30):**  to support a transition into regenerative supply and that's primarily what a big part  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:36):**  of my time is on right now with the company Howgood which I'll tell you more about as  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:41):**  we go.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah definitely.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:43):**  I think we have a lot to discuss so let's unpack them one by one and let's start with  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:49):**  the farming or let's start with the finance and transition level.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:08:52):**  You mentioned how to help farms that want to go in that transition level but often it  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:00):**  is, we know how to do it technically and how to move through the different levels of regenerative  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:05):**  agriculture but you see it's often also a question of finance and what role could finance  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:10):**  and impact investors who hopefully are all listening to this podcast, what role could  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:14):**  they play in that?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:16):**  Well actually I'm going to disagree with what you first said.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:19):**  I don't think people know how to get to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:25):**  A few people do and have laid out the science and the processes all around the world but  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:31):**  like one of my mentors would always say the future is here.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:36):**  It just isn't evenly distributed yet.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:39):**  So there are a handful of people who have really dug into carbon farming and the process  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:44):**  of regenerative agriculture but most everybody else doesn't actually know the steps and that's  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:50):**  partly because regenerative agriculture doesn't have best practices.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:09:54):**  You can't just take one thing that works somewhere and slap it down somewhere else.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:00):**  Regenerative agriculture actually requires understanding the unique context of the land  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:04):**  and the people and the culture and the history of wherever you're farming and innovating  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:09):**  new solutions and new directions for each individual place.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:15):**  So I do think there's still a lot of learning for farmers to do and I apply that to myself  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:21):**  as well as a farmer.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:23):**  We have a long way to go until our farm is actually regenerative at the deepest level  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:28):**  that I believe it can be.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:31):**  I do think to respond to your question that impact investors have a huge role to play  
**[0:10:37-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:37):**  but I think it's going to be different than how most of investing in venture capital currently  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:46):**  works because the reality is there just isn't a lot of regenerative agriculture out there  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:53):**  in a form that is investable.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, there's bankable or productable.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:10:58):**  No, you can't just go like develop a quick pipeline of $500 million of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:05):**  enterprises.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:06):**  They're just not out there.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:07):**  They're not ready.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:08):**  That would be amazing.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:09):**  That would be great.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:10):**  So I think the role of impact investors is going to have to be different in this case.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:15):**  I think impact investors need to think like an ecosystem and work like an ecosystem to  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:22):**  focus on prepping the soil of investors and of farmers to work together to actually develop  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:30):**  regenerative agriculture businesses that can turn a profit, that can grow.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:36):**  I don't think scale is necessarily what we want to look for in regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:39):**  at least not how it's thought about in the tech world.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, maybe scale the impact but yeah, it doesn't mean scale to 200,000 hectares on  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:47):**  one farm or something.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:49):**  No, no.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:50):**  And also I think the whole metaphor of scale is coming from the wrong paradigm and this  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:11:55):**  is something that we wrote about in the paper on the levels of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:00):**  At each level you're coming actually from a different internal paradigm of how you think  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:05):**  about the world.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:07):**  And the metaphor of scale comes from actually the machine, the mechanistic paradigm where  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:13):**  we look at the world like it's a machine and we think, okay, we just need to add more energy,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:20):**  get more output and scale it up, scale it up like we do an assembly line for making  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:25):**  cars.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:26):**  Like value chain comes out of the colonist view of the world and extracting.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:31):**  I had a big discussion with Gregory on that in the other podcast.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:35):**  But yeah, the supply chain comes from the same metaphor where everything is a machine.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:40):**  So we've got chains, we've got assembly lines, you can add a little more financial capital  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:45):**  and scale things up.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:47):**  And this is a sort of insidious way that most people go about thinking all the time but  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:12:56):**  it puts its imprint, the impact of that is more significant than the impact of the dollars  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:01):**  that are being invested.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:03):**  So we actually have to change our minds and change our paradigm to a living systems view.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:08):**  Language really.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:10):**  Since that interview, I'm starting to become more aware when I use a supply chain and usually  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:16):**  add a few sentences after that or don't use it at all.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:19):**  So it starts really with that.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:20):**  But yeah, I agree.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:21):**  It's a paradigm shift of what is an investor, what is a gambler, what is a speculator, what  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:25):**  means investing in an ecosystem, what means soil, but prepping the soil obviously, practically,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:32):**  prepping the soil.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:33):**  So what do you make sure can emerge after a while and how long, what's time in that  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:39):**  as well.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:40):**  It's a very different way of, but it's really slowing down a lot.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:44):**  And for many investors, especially from the fast Silicon Valley world where two years  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:48):**  is an eternity, that's not easy.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:50):**  It's like it's really forcing them to slow down and see the real economy and the real  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:56):**  assets, how they work.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:13:58):**  Yeah, I think we need investors to be thinking about the people, about the farmers and looking  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:06):**  for very, very what would be considered pre-startup, early, early stage looking for the right  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:14):**  people with whom to partner towards developing regenerative agriculture businesses.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:20):**  Because most farmers are not, I mean they are entrepreneurs.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:23):**  We have to be entrepreneurs to be farmers, but we're not trained in entrepreneurship.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:28):**  We're certainly not trained in how to grow a business in a way that can affect large  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:37):**  areas of land, metabolize large amounts of financial capital and turn it into living  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:43):**  capital.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:44):**  So I think investors who are interested in regenerative agriculture need to be thinking  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:49):**  in a longer term way and be cultivating the relationships and the businesses in enterprise  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:56):**  ecosystems in particular places where they have connections around the world.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:14:59):**  So you would say really to look where you are already connected to, which places are  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:07):**  low hanging fruit and that's of course between brackets to start this because it does require  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:13):**  a sense of community and building that up before there's even going to be an investment,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:17):**  before there's going to be anything investment ready.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah, before there's any financial capital investment.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:22):**  I think that's...  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:23):**  Obviously the other types of investment or the other types of investment have to be made  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:28):**  before.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:29):**  Yeah, I guess that's...  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:30):**  Yeah, I think that's a key is to use a multi-capital framework like the eight forms of capital  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:35):**  and look at what forms of capital do I need to invest to successfully prepare the soil  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:41):**  for a financial capital investment that can make a financial capital return.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:47):**  And if you look at let's say the two legs of the stool, if you look at the consumer side  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:53):**  and if you look at the agriculture side and maybe look one year ago till now, have you  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:15:59):**  seen a big shift in both ones?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:01):**  And if yes, what have you seen changed?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:04):**  So one thing that I think is huge, it's not quite to the consumer yet, but there is a  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:13):**  big shift from a year ago in the awareness of regeneration.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:18):**  And I think that's especially happened at the level of regenerative business.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:22):**  I see the word everywhere, but maybe just because I'm focusing on it.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:25):**  No, that's been in the last year.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:28):**  Regenerative business and regenerative agriculture have 100x or 1000x from a year ago.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:34):**  And I think that has a lot to do with its uptake and adoption in the natural products  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:40):**  industry.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:41):**  So bigger brands like Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's have been thinking about and using the term  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:49):**  and figuring out what does it mean for them, but definitely promoting it before they necessarily  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:56):**  have it.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:16:57):**  And of course, there's two sides to that.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:00):**  But I think that's been a huge shift is the awareness has been really rapidly growing  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:05):**  and partly I think that's because of the regenerative business summit that has happened the last  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:11):**  two years where some of these players are coming together to take a look at not just  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:18):**  how do you build soil or how do you increase the health of an ecosystem, but how do you  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:23):**  take that living systems paradigm and apply it to your actual business.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:29):**  And the regenerative business summit that just happened is a totally – it's not  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:33):**  a conference.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:34):**  It's a full-on thinking event where CEOs and business unit leaders from around the  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:40):**  world come together to resource each other and figure out how to transform their businesses  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:46):**  towards regeneration.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:48):**  And the combination of that with groups like New Hope which runs the natural product expos  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:17:55):**  in the United States, they were actually awarded one of the – they were one of the honorees  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:00):**  of the regenerative business prize this year.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:03):**  And that's partially because they're adding a sense of regeneration into their conferences  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:09):**  that thousands of people come to, brands and consumers alike, so that the awareness of  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:15):**  regenerative agriculture is very quickly growing.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:17):**  I predict a year from now it'll be, I don't know, a hundred times more available and aware  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:25):**  in the mind of the consumer and consumers will really be looking for and starting to  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:29):**  ask for it a lot more than they are now.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:32):**  And can we deliver as a sector?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:34):**  Because if people ask for it and it's not there it can also lead to attention.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:38):**  Yeah, I think that's a big question.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:42):**  I'm not certain that there's enough regenerative agriculture to actually supply the demand  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:51):**  that will come.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:52):**  Because you just mentioned there are only a few people that are actually a few farmers  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:18:56):**  or a few people that are on the land and probably there are even a few others that are capable  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:00):**  of doing it but don't have access to sufficient land to actually produce sufficient amounts.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:06):**  So that would mean that probably there isn't enough supply, really regenerative supply  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:12):**  to fill up this demand, even just from the natural product sector.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:15):**  This is why I think we need to step beyond the polar view of yes it is, no it isn't.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:24):**  And see instead a spectrum.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:27):**  As a journey.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:28):**  Like a continuum or a spectrum of possibilities and effects.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:34):**  And how good, which is really working on the consumer awareness and sort of the will of  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:41):**  the market to know about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:45):**  We map everything in terms of spectrums.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:49):**  If you download the app you can take a look at a very high level view of what is the spectrum  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:56):**  of growing practices from degenerative to regenerative.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:19:59):**  What does it look like?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:01):**  And with that people can begin to discern, like you said, where is this company, where  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:06):**  is this product on its journey towards regeneration?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:10):**  It's not a yes, no, oh we're there now.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:12):**  In fact regeneration is never something that you arrive at.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:16):**  It is always an evolutionary continuing to grow process.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:20):**  So we need people to be able to start thinking less in terms of yes and no, black and white,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:27):**  and more where are we on the spectrum, where are we planning to go, and how are we going  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:33):**  to get there.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:35):**  So let me rephrase.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:36):**  Is there enough supply that is well away on the journey that we'll be happy with?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:43):**  Or is there a lot of work to do to even supply them with enough products that are on that  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:50):**  journey and we feel comfortable as they are really on that journey and have made a good  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:56):**  progress so far?  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:57):**  There's not enough.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:20:58):**  I wish I could say it differently, but there's just not enough.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:03):**  I mean the top 10% of the food system, if we're focusing on food, though I'm actually  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:09):**  very interested in the personal care and cosmetics supply system as well for a number of reasons,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:14):**  but if we talk about food, if everybody stores from the top 10% of producers, we would be  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:21):**  very happy.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:23):**  That would be excellent.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:24):**  I do believe there's a growing amount of supply in that range where it's not just organic,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:31):**  it's beyond organic, it's organic and it's fair trade and they're doing some carbon farming.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:37):**  That is like quickly growing and there might maybe be enough supply to meet demand, but  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:42):**  probably not.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:43):**  We still have a long ways to go and it's an amazing moment for investment into this space  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:49):**  because from all the signals I see from all over the world, from all the different industries  
**[0:21:54-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:21:54):**  that I track, this really is the next big thing and investors who are able to consciously,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:04):**  carefully get in now, I believe are going to be very well positioned for the years to  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:09):**  come.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:10):**  Looking at how good you mentioned, we're looking at this continuum of where these companies,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:16):**  these products are.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:17):**  Do you look also at the companies, because of course we can look at the farms level like  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:20):**  you mentioned before and you mentioned also before, we really see some of these companies  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:24):**  taking this ecosystem, this holistic ecosystem approach to their companies as well.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:29):**  Do you look at that at how good and how do you put them on that continuum if you have  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:35):**  a company that you're evaluating?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:38):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:39):**  A portion of the score of the rating for any Howgood rated product, and Howgood by the  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:46):**  way is primarily in food.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:48):**  We've been in food for 10 years.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:50):**  We've rated 250,000 products.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:53):**  We have about 70 indicators for every product.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:22:57):**  But natural cosmetics are coming, right?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:00):**  Yes, cosmetics are coming.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:02):**  Personal care is the next one to roll out and we'll be going into other verticals after  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:07):**  that.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:08):**  But in food, we have the largest food sustainability database in the world.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:13):**  Part of that is looking at the companies.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:17):**  A lot of what we're looking at is basic CSR, corporate social responsibility work.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:25):**  Our real value add is not in the evaluation of the companies.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:29):**  There are so few companies that are really pushing the edge of regeneration in terms  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:34):**  of agriculture and they already, you know, they do well in the basic CSR kind of study  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:43):**  of their work, but they are included, the actual company and how it's doing is included  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:48):**  in every product that is produced by that company.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:52):**  So I think it's important.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:23:56):**  I think how good really adds value is our ability to distinguish at the product level  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:03):**  and really help somebody choose between different individual products and not just the companies  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:08):**  that make them.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:09):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:10):**  I was also asking that question to see for impact investors, these companies often have  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:16):**  a different trajectory than what we've seen in the quote unquote normal investing or private  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:21):**  equity world.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:23):**  And I see sometimes a struggle of investing in these companies or putting money to work  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:27):**  in the companies.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:28):**  Can you say a bit more about the different angles or levels of investment you see that  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:33):**  are currently being experimented with to put money to work in both the company level and  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:39):**  maybe later on the farm level?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:41):**  I guess the one creative thing that I have seen a little bit of and would love to see  
**[0:24:46-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:46):**  more of is not from the standard impact investor approach, but more from the brand to farm  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:24:55):**  approach or the consumer product goods brand investing in their system of supply and therefore  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:02):**  into farms or producer communities who are really producing the core materials that go  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:09):**  into their products.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:11):**  So more and more you're seeing different companies develop internal investment funds that are  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:18):**  I think really intelligent to engage with their supply to ensure long term availability  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:27):**  even in a complex climate change world with more shocks, more disruptions to supply.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:36):**  Those brands that are really working with their suppliers, not just like sending them  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:41):**  audits and coming to evaluate what they're doing, but are actually saying, okay, are  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:47):**  you interested in moving to organic or moving beyond organic?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:51):**  Great.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:52):**  What do you need to get there?  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:53):**  Do you need technical assistance?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:54):**  Do you need new equipment?  
**[0:25:56-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:25:56):**  Do you need a nursery of improved varieties that you can plant out into the agroforestry  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:04):**  system and are really engaging with their suppliers to figure out what they need and  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:10):**  then backing that up with long term buying contracts and buying relationships.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:16):**  So in a way, getting to pay back their own investment through higher quality, more reliable  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:24):**  products or materials and a very exciting story to hand to their marketing department  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:31):**  and to show to their consumer.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:33):**  So that I think is very interesting.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:36):**  So to tie that all together, I can see something very interesting in impact investors working  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:42):**  with the brands they invest in to help them set up investment funds for their suppliers.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:48):**  So really looking at the whole system and not just at individual organisms as if they  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:54):**  exist alone.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:26:56):**  And I mean, this could be, I think, one of the most interesting co-investment opportunities  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:00):**  you can imagine because you're so deep into a brand that you hopefully like, otherwise  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:05):**  you wouldn't be co-investing with it and into their supply web, strengthening the brand,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:11):**  strengthening their web.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:12):**  And of course, with all the expertise of the brand and the company, it also de-risks a  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:16):**  lot of things.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:17):**  You're working in climate change regions, et cetera, but you have the backing and all  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:23):**  the knowledge and the contracts of a larger brand behind it.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:26):**  And I think that you're absolutely right.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:28):**  I think there's a huge opportunity to put money to work alongside and with the brands  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:33):**  that know what they're doing.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:36):**  And also that's sort of on the positive potential side.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:38):**  I think it's really important for brands and investors to be doing complex whole systems  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:45):**  risk assessment for their systems of supply as climate change intensifies, as the global  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:52):**  refugee crisis intensifies, which will continue happening.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:27:56):**  And I think, by the way, there's a real opportunity there having to do with regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:01):**  But I think that really mapping out the supply system and looking for risks and opportunities  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:08):**  is going to be key.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:11):**  And there's a few firms that are doing that pretty well.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:15):**  Most of them are just looking at what could go wrong.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:19):**  And then a handful are starting to say, well, here's what could go wrong, but here's also  
**[0:28:24-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:24):**  where the opportunities are to not just stop it from going wrong, but actually to increase  
**[0:28:32-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:32):**  the quality and the resilience and even the anti-fragility of these systems ahead of time.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:40):**  And I think that's going to be more and more important in this unstable economic and global  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:45):**  climate.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:46):**  And what's the role?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:47):**  Because you mentioned very, very rightfully so most of the people aren't accredited investors,  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:54):**  you and me included.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:28:55):**  But I would love to put some of my money to work in these type of companies and on the  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:00):**  ground.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:01):**  What's the role of the consumers of the brand?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:03):**  Could we get into at some point, have you seen anything of that or have you heard anybody  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:07):**  on the crowd investing side to also get that group of stakeholders in the company, the  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:14):**  consumers involved in this transition?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:16):**  I think crowdfunding is a cool opportunity.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:19):**  New laws in the United States make it much more possible.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:22):**  And I think people are looking to it.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:25):**  It's not necessarily any easier from a brand or a farm's perspective to run a successful  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:30):**  crowdfunding campaign as it is to get traditional investment.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:35):**  It's differently difficult.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:37):**  I think that one of the key, I'm not going to call it a leverage point because again,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:42):**  this is funny, the idea of a leverage point comes from the mechanical paradigm.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:51):**  And yet we've mentioned it a couple of times in this one.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:29:54):**  So the way that I think about it now is instead of a leverage point, I think about a nodal  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:01):**  point or a node.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:02):**  This is more like thinking about acupuncture.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:05):**  You're putting in this tiny needle and it doesn't even necessarily do anything at the  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:10):**  point where it goes in.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:13):**  But it shifts the energy flow of the whole organism, of the whole system.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:18):**  So that's what we're looking for, these little nodal intervention points that by putting  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:23):**  a small amount of focus and attention and energy and investment, we can shift the whole  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:28):**  system.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:30):**  So I think that one of those points, and I don't quite know how to work it yet and I'd  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:36):**  love to hear other people's thinking on this, has to do with a simple metric, which is the  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:42):**  percent of income that an individual spends on food every year.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:47):**  So in the United States, that percent is at 8% right now.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:51):**  Only 8% of our income goes to food.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:30:54):**  If double that, 16%, if 20% went to food, all of a sudden a lot more of the regenerative  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:03):**  agriculture systems, a lot more of the very local, small, close to home food options become  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:09):**  much, much more viable.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:13):**  So a wholesale shift in people's percent income spent on food, I think that might be one of  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:21):**  the fastest ways for consumers to engage in transforming the system, because it's not  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:26):**  one individual thing they do with their money and then go ahead and keep doing everything  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:30):**  else they do with their money.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:31):**  It's thinking about it systemically across their whole patterns of use of financial capital.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:37):**  How do I change this to purchasing regenerative products?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:43):**  So we have a, how it's going to release later this year, and I've worked a bit with the  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:48):**  folks at Kiss the Ground on this, a regenerative diet model that gives some ideas about how  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:31:56):**  I would buy regeneratively and what that would look like.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:01):**  How do I make a decision if I'm looking at vegetables versus meat versus dairy?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:06):**  What level of regenerative agriculture do I need to be purchasing at for that to work  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:11):**  really well?  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:13):**  I think that's a very interesting point to look at.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:17):**  I don't think it can be a government mandated or supported thing.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:21):**  No, that would be difficult.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:23):**  But there are some ways that I think could be intervened to shift that.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:28):**  And if in a whole bio region, people started spending more on really high quality food,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:35):**  that would at a very basic level increase the financial capital income of producers  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:42):**  who are moving in a good way.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:43):**  And does that mean that in countries where people are spending already a lot more of  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:49):**  their income, I'm seeing some European countries where it's still, I think, at 15, 16%.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:55):**  Is there more space there or just means that the income level is higher in the US?  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:32:58):**  So it's more or less the same money, but maybe in countries where food still is much more  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:03):**  important and is much more of a cultural thing as well.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:08):**  Maybe there's a bigger leverage or it's more difficult because it's still maybe at a higher  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:13):**  level to begin with.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:14):**  I'm just thinking out loud.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:16):**  Yeah, I think that if you look at places where there's a higher percent of income spent on  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:19):**  food, I think you would see that people eat better and are healthier and have lower health  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:24):**  care costs and that the agriculture is closer to regenerative than it is here in the States  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:30):**  and some of the other parts of Europe where the percent income on food is still very low.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:36):**  Like here in the Netherlands.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:37):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:38):**  So, and I think if we were really looking for the nodal points there, yeah, we'd look  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:45):**  at where it's lowest and what could be done, especially in the US, as such a large market  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:51):**  to shift that.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:33:53):**  But thinking from the producer side, I believe that systemically looking for higher margin  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:02):**  places to produce for and sell for is very interesting.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:06):**  That's part of why I love personal care and cosmetics is because more and more in that  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:13):**  industry people are heading towards natural, which doesn't mean anything, people are heading  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:18):**  towards plant-based and organic solutions to their products and the margins in personal  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:24):**  care are extravagantly higher than they are in food.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:28):**  So I think-  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:29):**  Because they're so expensive and people pay.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:31):**  Because they're so expensive and people pay for it.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:33):**  Exactly.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:34):**  So I think that farmers would be wise to devote a percentage or a portion of their area to  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:42):**  producing crops for sale to the cosmetics industry, especially if you're certified organic,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:50):**  especially if you're heading towards regenerative and have a really good story to tell there.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:34:54):**  I think that a small, you know, 10% of land area put into cosmetic crops could bring a  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:02):**  significant portion of income because of the higher margins that are available.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:06):**  I think it's interesting to look at those worlds together.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:10):**  Usually it's separated.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:11):**  I'm either producing for food or I'm producing ingredients for the cosmetic industry.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:16):**  But of course, in a regenerative farm or regenerative landscape, you're producing so many different  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:22):**  products and hopefully such an abundance that it shouldn't be that difficult to add a few  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:28):**  very high margin things to it.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:29):**  Even if you're selling for cosmetics instead of feeding people, it still feeds the whole  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:34):**  system.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:35):**  Yeah, it's also a great way if you are starting a regenerative agriculture venture-  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:41):**  To get cash flow.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:43):**  To have an early income because a lot of perennial tree crop systems, which by the way, most  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:49):**  farms that actually achieve regenerative agriculture in the coming 10 years will be perennial crops  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:57):**  and tree crops.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:35:59):**  The science just is much stronger for agroforestry than it is for grazing.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:06):**  I love livestock.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:08):**  I think it's excellent and can do a lot of good in the world.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:10):**  But if you really want to tackle climate change, if you really want to quickly put carbon into  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:19):**  long-term storage, then planting trees is absolutely the way to do it.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:26):**  And before here in the Northeast, I'm thinking a lot about chestnuts and hazelnuts and other  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:32):**  sort of perennial nut crops.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:34):**  Those take five to 10 years before they start yielding.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:38):**  So in the meantime, having a short-term annual or shorter lived herbaceous perennial that  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:47):**  can be sold into the market, I think is a very good idea.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:52):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:53):**  I want to thank you and end with a final question.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:36:58):**  We've already discussed a few items, but let's see and let's hope that a lot of smart impact  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:04):**  investors are listening to this podcast.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:06):**  And I always like to end with this question.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:09):**  They are ready.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:10):**  They are interested.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:11):**  They are ready to put their capital to work through a lot of different types of capital.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:18):**  Where should they start?  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:20):**  They should start, of course, locally as well.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:22):**  But what if they are already doing things?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:23):**  Where else if they are active in their local community and if they want to put more capital  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:29):**  to work outside of that?  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:30):**  What do you think are the most interesting angles they can explore in the next few months?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:35):**  I think the key that I would look for is perennial crops, is looking towards agroforestry as  
**[0:37:44-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:44):**  an investment in all parts of the world, especially places that are on the edges of where climate  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:53):**  change will have the most significant impacts.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:37:55):**  So you can look at a global map of where there is going to be the greatest disruption from  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:01):**  climate change and you can know that there are going to be significant numbers of people  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:05):**  leaving those places.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:07):**  And just think about all the islands that are literally going underwater.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:11):**  And if we can get 10 years out ahead of that and fund regenerative agroforestry systems  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:18):**  producing not just food but products for the personal care and cleaning products industry,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:25):**  then the interesting thing is that establishing agroforestry systems is not – there is like  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:33):**  less work in some ways at the beginning.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:35):**  There is always, of course, work to get started.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:37):**  But if they can be established, then when they start producing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 years  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:43):**  from now, then I think the influx of people that will unfortunately but likely be coming,  
**[0:38:50-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:50):**  there can be ready employment opportunities and real production of secure food and fiber  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:38:59):**  and all sorts of things from these agroforestry systems.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:03):**  So that is what I would look for.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:04):**  I would also look for companies that are actually doing carbon measurement.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:08):**  More and more, you are going to see brands and farms claiming to be regenerative without  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:16):**  really even knowing what it means, thinking it is just organic plus a little more.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:22):**  And it is a lot more than that.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:24):**  And I think that those who are serious enough to be measuring their carbon systemically  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:29):**  as even – that is just level one regenerative agriculture, but it is a really good step.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:35):**  So I would look for investment opportunities where people are actually measuring and figure  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:41):**  out how to partner.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:42):**  We need chimeras.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:45):**  We need this combination of regenerative farming.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:48):**  What is a chimera?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:49):**  A chimera is – it is from the classical myths.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:53):**  It is a creature that kind of comes together from multiple different creatures, you know,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:39:57):**  a lion's head and a dragon's body or something like that.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:01):**  And I think we need a chimera between regenerative agriculture, farmers on the ground, and then  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:07):**  business people because they are not – we just don't have enough time for farmers  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:11):**  to learn what they need to to have an MBA.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:13):**  And for MBAs or investors to learn everything that they need to about farming, I think we  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:19):**  need to chimera them together, like graft them together to create businesses that can  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:26):**  rapidly take on regenerating the soil, regenerating the ecosystem, and therefore regenerating  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:33):**  the larger global system of supply.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:36):**  So that is where I would focus.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:37):**  And to – I mean, I am always asking five final questions actually at the end.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:41):**  What would you be working on for the next, let's say, few months?  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:45):**  And if we talk in a year from now, what would you look back on in these big challenges?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:51):**  What are you most excited about until the end of the year?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:40:55):**  We're launching new rating systems at HowGood to help people discern between a not-so-good  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:04):**  product and a good product and a great one and the best one that's out there.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:08):**  So we'll be launching in personal care, and after that we'll do cleaning products.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:14):**  And after that I'm very interested to work on clothing so that people all over the world  
**[0:41:19-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:19):**  can very, very quickly discern how far on the path to regeneration a given product is.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:29):**  Most products won't be anywhere close yet, but some will be headed there.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:34):**  And I think that's part of the invitation for impact investors as well is to grow your  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:41):**  discernment capability.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:42):**  That's what the levels of regenerative agriculture paper we wrote is all about, so that people  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:47):**  can have a way to discern between the different levels that are happening.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:51):**  So I'm going to be working on launching those new verticals.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:53):**  I'm also going to be changing a lot of things on our farm coming up this year.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:41:59):**  Yeah, it was going to be my next question.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:01):**  What are you working on on the farm?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:03):**  Well, we bought an old orchard and we are changing the orchard.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:09):**  We're grafting over the old varieties and putting new disease-resistant ones on.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:13):**  We're integrating livestock.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:14):**  So there's sheep grazing under the apple trees.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:17):**  We're going to be planting a number of new crops, some of them cosmetic crops, other  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:21):**  than medicinal herb crops to have shorter-term yields.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:24):**  But then also really looking at on our farm and in other land locally, what does a long-term  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:34):**  regenerative agriculture model look like that could also incorporate real estate?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:41):**  This is something I've worked in before, developing a regenerative real estate business model.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:48):**  And I have some very interesting ideas that I'd love to come on in probably about five  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:52):**  years.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:53):**  I'll be ready to speak with your investors again and tell them a bit more about the opportunity.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:42:57):**  But for now, we're just measuring the carbon, testing out the business model and making  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:04):**  sure we have the right crops for our local ecosystem.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:08):**  And the neighbors, what was and is their response to you?  
**[0:43:13-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:13):**  First of all, putting sheep in an apple orchard, which must look crazy for many.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:22):**  So far, the response is great.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:24):**  It's a funny area.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:25):**  Are they copying?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:26):**  Are they taking over things?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:29):**  We're just getting started here.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:32):**  There are several farmers who have said, that's great.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:35):**  Can you bring your sheep over to my orchard to graze?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:38):**  We are not in a really heavily agricultural area.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:43):**  And so it's not like we're in the Midwest.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:48):**  So everybody here is pumped that there's local food headed towards regeneration.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:54):**  I want to thank you so much for your time and sharing.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:43:56):**  I will definitely link a lot of resources we discussed below.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:01):**  And we'll be checking in earlier than five years as well, sooner than five years, just  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:05):**  to hear about a lot of the other projects and thank you so much for your time.

**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:12):**  You just listened to an interview with Ethan Soloviev, international regenerative agriculture  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:17):**  expert, although he doesn't believe in experts.

**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:24):**  in the food and agriculture system, where impact investors and farmers can have the  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:44:28):**  biggest change for the least amount of effort because there's so much to do.

**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:11):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:21):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:23):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:25):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:29):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/11/28/ethan-soloviev/#t=0:48:31):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

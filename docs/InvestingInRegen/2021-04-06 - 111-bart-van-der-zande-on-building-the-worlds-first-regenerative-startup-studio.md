**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:14):**  What is a startup studio and why are they fundamental for the future of regen food and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:17):**  ag?  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:18):**  I believe we need a lot more companies working on regenerating soils at scale.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:23):**  So why don't we see them?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:24):**  And why don't we see many reaching the scale and impact we need?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:27):**  How can we help people who have experience in building things, food companies, funds,  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:32):**  organizations, experience with raising money, building teams to become active in soil?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:38):**  That's where the startup studio model comes in to create many more successful surviving  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:43):**  companies to regenerate soils at scale.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:48):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:52):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:53):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:00:58):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:08):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:10):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:14):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:17):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt, soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:25):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:30):**  our work.

**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:33):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:37):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome to another episode today with Bart van de Sonden, co-founder of Fresh Ventures,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:01:56):**  the startup studio focused on region egg and food companies based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:00):**  and a good friend.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:01):**  And I'm an advisor to the studio.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:02):**  So I'm very, very happy to, I think after two or three years of discussions to finally  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:06):**  have you on the pod and to dive deeper into what is a startup studio and why is it so  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:11):**  extremely necessary in our space?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:14):**  But to start with a personal question, why are you focusing on soil?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:18):**  Why am I focusing on soil?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:20):**  Maybe move back a little bit on why I got where we are now before I get into soil and  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:25):**  the rural place.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:26):**  I have a background in marketing and media and business actually.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:31):**  So not at all in soil.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:34):**  And actually before I ended in my thesis, I joined an entrepreneur.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:38):**  I joined a company which I ended up co-owning and I got into this entrepreneurial ecosystems  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:45):**  by being a startup myself and trying to find out how it works and the fundraising and building  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:51):**  an organization and all that stuff.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:02:53):**  But we pivoted our own model towards our clients being coworking spaces, innovation, ecosystems,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:02):**  startup ecosystems.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:03):**  And in that period that was growing quite fast as well.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:07):**  So I got to learn about the questions that were going on there from the two sides, actually  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:13):**  on the one side we were a startup and we were invited and supported by these infrastructures.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:18):**  But on the other side we were also trying to deliver value to organizations that were  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:24):**  doing that.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:25):**  And in that period I was learning a lot and got very much interested in how and why startups  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:33):**  fail, why they succeed, how can we do better for our personal use obviously, but also in  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:39):**  a more general sense, how can we build strong startup ecosystems and healthy businesses.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:45):**  And I've always been interested, let's say in sustainability in a more general sense.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:51):**  I think you and me, we met when I was a host at the Impact Hub very long time ago.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:57):**  Some years.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:58):**  Yeah, some years.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:03:59):**  But it was always sort of an interest of this is an area where a lot of cool stuff happened  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:04):**  as well and also as the direction to go.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:07):**  But while we were building these communities, these entrepreneurial communities, and while  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:12):**  we're building our own company, I switched to very much an intrinsic drive in sort of  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:19):**  the mission to bring the economy within planetary boundaries.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:22):**  And it became very urgent to me.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:24):**  Until a certain day, I walked into one of the ecosystems that we built then, coworking  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:29):**  space that we were in and looked around and I saw all these entrepreneurial friends as  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:35):**  well and they're working very hard and thinking about conversations about scaling and stuff  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:41):**  like that.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:42):**  But it really dawned, it was a daunting thought for me.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:45):**  Like, what are we building actually?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:47):**  What are we scaling?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:48):**  What is all this talent doing actually, if we maybe even better do nothing if we're not  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:53):**  working in the right direction and then what is the right direction obviously.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:04:58):**  So that's when I founded Impact Express, an organization three years ago with my partner  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:04):**  Hoop Dekkers and where my interest was really born from the idea of how can I get, well,  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:11):**  my personal talent in time but from all this entrepreneurial talent and this way of working  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:16):**  on building healthy organizations into the right direction.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:20):**  Hoop came from a different direction and he's an anthropologist and works with, well, company  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:26):**  culture you could say and always interested in how to organize togetherness as well.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:33):**  And he was already working a lot in also helping companies grow the, for example, business  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:40):**  models that help grow biodiversity.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:42):**  And so he was more on the subject already.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:46):**  And when I met him, he had almost a similar ambition but coming from a totally different  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:51):**  side because he saw that there were great ideas or pilot cases or reports written and  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:05:58):**  ideas on how to move forward but then solutions.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:02):**  But all on a small scale, let's say you came from the scale.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:05):**  Yeah, from a small scale, that's one thing but also maybe, well, I wouldn't say the wrong  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:09):**  people but then, yeah, maybe the wrong people working on it, innovation managers or corporate  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:15):**  responsibility, stuff like that.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:17):**  And when you say wrong, you mean that the ones that are not going to build a larger  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:21):**  organization to actually bring it to the impact it could have.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:25):**  Like it's very likely or it was very likely it was going to stop.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:28):**  Like it wasn't going to reach a huge acreage or a huge amount of insects or a huge amount  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:34):**  of food that it would stop.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:36):**  Like it was a natural limit.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:37):**  Yeah, but also even before that, taking the risk or having the opportunity actually starting  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:44):**  the company.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:45):**  Most of the time it wouldn't start.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:46):**  It wouldn't even start.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:47):**  Like the whole dynamic would be more based around on a project level.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:52):**  And if the money runs out for this certain project or research or whatever, lacking the  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:06:57):**  creativity to actually go look for a market or build a team or seeing that as an opportunity  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:03):**  maybe outside the organization that are already involved.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:06):**  Sometimes it's hard to have a change or create a change within an existing organization.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:12):**  It's only that far that you can go.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:14):**  You have to convince a lot of people.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:16):**  But then the lack of entrepreneurship to get this off the ground.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:20):**  In that period, obviously, you and I had conversations as well.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:24):**  You introduced me also to soil and regenerative agriculture, but also to the impact investment  
**[0:07:29-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:29):**  side and sharing stories of impact investment being still niche, but growing pot of money,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:37):**  but also a lack of investable team.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:40):**  So this is very much what we've been doing the past three years, trying to find ways  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:45):**  to enable people to start using their talent and time to build organizations or become  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:51):**  part of organizations that work towards an economy within planetary boundaries and moving  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:56):**  closer to soil.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:07:57):**  It's funny that you say investable teams, not investable entrepreneurs.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:01):**  Why is that?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:02):**  You mean individuals instead of teams?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:04):**  I am sure it's delivered, but it's the…  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:06):**  I mean, I only asked one question, but we're going to siteway many times, I think, in this  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:10):**  conversation.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:11):**  So let's start here.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:12):**  Yeah, no problem.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:13):**  Now, obviously, I think many investors also look for teams instead of a single founder  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:18):**  organizations, mainly because of the success rate.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:22):**  I think you need different skills, different types of knowledge, and that is quite impossible  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:29):**  to find in one person.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:32):**  So building complementary teams is, I think, a very important part of success of young  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:38):**  companies or companies in general.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:41):**  And I think also that teams is such a big part of the failure or the success of a startup.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:48):**  That's the reason why I said investable teams probably and not enterprises, so to say.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:53):**  Did that answer your question, Koon?  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:57):**  And I think we're going to look at that.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:58):**  We'll get into a little bit more.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:08:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:00):**  And the Startup Studio model, because you said these three years, I've been looking  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:03):**  at ways for startups to be more successful, for more startups to be successful.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:09):**  And you stumbled upon or you found this model that has been used in many other sectors,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:13):**  actually.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:14):**  And I'm curious to know how many people on the podcast is new, like what is a startup  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:18):**  studio?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:19):**  It's not a TV studio.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:20):**  What should I imagine when somebody says a venture builder or startup studio?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:23):**  What do you answer when people ask that?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:24):**  Because I think you get that question all the time, but I'm obviously curious to bring  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:28):**  it to this audience.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:30):**  For me, a startup studio is an organization that uses a repeatable process to build new  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:38):**  ventures from scratch.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:39):**  There are different ways and different shapes and forms of the startup studio.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:44):**  But the main thing is that it's really looking at what can go wrong, so to say, and what  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:49):**  are the reasons startups succeed or fail within, for example, a specific niche that you're  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:09:55):**  working in and how can we, from the beginning on, organize on decreasing the risk and do  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:02):**  it in a repeatable way.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:03):**  So I think the average of the startup studios lies around almost four ventures a year created.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:11):**  So it's a very early stage.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:13):**  It's the beginning of the pipeline.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:14):**  So if you accelerate the model, for example, way more, well, a lot of people know that.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:21):**  Meaning that you come with a company that needs to be sped up, but in this case, it's  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:27):**  really starting from scratch.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:28):**  It's starting from scratch and it's coming from different angles, I think.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:31):**  So you have also investors that started working, for example, with great teams first.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:37):**  You have programs like, for example, you have an entrepreneur first in the UK and both of  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:43):**  them are actually international that really only focus on building teams and then trusting  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:49):**  that they will build good stuff.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:50):**  So co-founder matching being a big part, some studios do a lot of it in house.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:10:55):**  So basically you're saying that they start with a team that doesn't have a concrete company  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:00):**  idea or focus yet.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:02):**  Basically, like you said, trusting that they will find a great team finds a great company.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:08):**  So it's a different, can some studios start with developing and validating ideas themselves  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:14):**  because that's probably what they're good at.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:16):**  And then they attract a founder or a founding team and work towards a spin out or an exit.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:22):**  But you can also, that's what Entrepreneur First and Handler, for example, are doing  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:25):**  are really only focusing on the co-founder matching and trusting that if you have a good  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:30):**  team and you bring them together, they will build good stuff as well.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:34):**  I think that's also a big challenge, also what we found in the conversations we've had,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:40):**  like building your, finding a good co-founder and finding your first, the first people you  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:44):**  build with is very hard.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:47):**  And that's part of the key as well, I think, in helping that, especially if you talk about,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:52):**  if we go to, for example, Regenerative or the food system, maybe I think there's quite  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:11:57):**  a big gap between people that actually know what needs to happen or have long-term experience  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:03):**  within the food system.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:05):**  And on the other side, people that have experience in building organisations or commercialising  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:10):**  solutions or finding working business cases, that's quite a big gap now, I think.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:15):**  It's hard for these people to meet on the one side, these, well, let's say entrepreneurial  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:19):**  people, they have difficulties and probably those are people that write you as well because  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:23):**  they start listening to the podcast to learn more about the generalised agriculture, but  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:27):**  it's a long learning curve.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:28):**  So how do you meet a co-founder that is good at it?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:32):**  And on the other side, you see that as well.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:33):**  So doing the co-founder matching is something that can already add value.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:38):**  And I see it a lot, actually, people reaching out that are not from the food and eggs space,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:42):**  they don't have a farming background and they get enthusiastic.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:47):**  They get hooked on soil, let's say, or they get hooked on ocean regeneration and they  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:52):**  use the podcast as education, which is amazing because it's one of the reasons why we share  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:12:56):**  them to take you on the journey with us as we are learning.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:00):**  But then the next step is, okay, what am I going to build?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:03):**  What am I going to join?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:04):**  How can I be professionally involved in this space and not just as a consumer or as a client  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:09):**  or as an investor, how can I be entrepreneurial in this space as well?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:13):**  And what would you, because you're funded or you're fundraising at the moment, but you're  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:17):**  also partly funded, like this is going to happen.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:19):**  You're going to do the startup studio is happening.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:21):**  What are the next steps or what are the steps for somebody to imagine what a process of  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:25):**  a startup studio, in this case, focus on region food and egg looks like?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, so for us, I think to pedal back a little bit, what you said is like finding this space  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:34):**  to start and how to start.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:35):**  I think that's what we are trying to solve.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:37):**  So to build this bridge with the startup studio that we have now.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:40):**  So it's called Fresh Ventures.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:42):**  And what we're trying to do is build a process for people to get involved.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:47):**  And if I would get a little bit more specific, what we're going to do this year, sourcing  
**[0:13:52-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:52):**  around 30 people, so a group of people from Europe and get them to Rotterdam, multidisciplinary  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:13:59):**  group.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:00):**  So a combination of people that have experience in the food system or CTO, let's say a lot  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:06):**  of knowledge, for example, on soil or specific area within the food system and more people  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:12):**  that can help build these organizations.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:15):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:16):**  And on the other side is what we call the opportunity to diligence.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:18):**  And that's also if you look at the studio model, like doing your own pre-work, so to  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:23):**  say, in developing what do we actually need to build?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:27):**  So I think that's also a differentiation or sort of a translation of the current studio  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:32):**  model is that it's not just about building working companies that are able to exit and  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:38):**  create a return, obviously, but it starts with a challenge.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:43):**  So if we start with a challenge and we look at the transition towards regenerative agriculture  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:48):**  to a regenerative or circular food system, what is actually lacking right now?  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:52):**  What is actually need to be built and building sort of almost a database of challenges and  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:14:58):**  opportunities and maybe business cases that work or that is worked on by pioneers, but  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:05):**  is not going fast enough or they recognize that they are not the right people to bring  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:09):**  it forward.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:10):**  And using that as a basis, you could say sort of all these ingredients together in a program,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:16):**  a four-month program with the goal to find, well, first off, obviously, sort of on a human  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:21):**  level a connection because you cannot force it.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:24):**  Obviously, it's not like you guys have a great fit on a profile level.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:28):**  You should get it.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:29):**  It's very much a personal thing.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:31):**  So no, no, no, no.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:36):**  Yeah, it's something else.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:39):**  And so a process of, I think, also building a certain mindset that we can go into that  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:44):**  a little bit later, but building a certain mindset, finding the right co-founder, finding  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:48):**  a match between founders and a certain idea or a challenge area.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:52):**  So people have obviously certain skills, certain interests that will gravitate them towards  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:15:57):**  certain areas, which is needed also to be dedicated to the level that to get up, to  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:02):**  get up in the morning, to get up in the morning.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:05):**  And when it gets really rough to keep going, it has to feel like it's yours.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:10):**  So that's a process.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:11):**  And then if these matches are found going towards the solutions and validating those  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:17):**  solutions, so what we're trying to do is really build an ecosystem, both of pioneer  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:22):**  organizations and investors and have them involved and listen very good to what is actually  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:28):**  needed, what they needed, what they stumble upon, how we can tackle that and involve them  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:32):**  also in this process.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:33):**  So as soon as the teams get very much interested in a specific problem area, for example, that  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:39):**  they can get into touch with the right people to really get a deeper understanding of what  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:44):**  is actually going on and what the problem actually is.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:46):**  And the same for if they start building or trying to build sort of solutions to that  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:51):**  problem, being able to validate it quickly, directly with farmers or with the relevant  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:57):**  stakeholder, depending on obviously the solution.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:16:59):**  I think that's a crucial point.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:00):**  The validation is what startup studios differentiate, I think from many other approaches.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:06):**  One is the romantic story we have of the lonely entrepreneur in the garage building something  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:11):**  and then this first person joins and the second person, etc, etc.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:15):**  But it could be years before something happens or it doesn't and years of time and resources  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:20):**  and energy and sweat, blood and tears are wasted.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:24):**  This term of validation, can you dive a bit deeper into that?  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:27):**  What does it mean in a startup studio and what happens if, let's say, validation comes  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:32):**  back and it's not validated, like it's not getting any traction?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:35):**  What's the importance of validation for a studio like yours?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:38):**  Yeah, I think if you look at the reasons why startups fail, we already mentioned problems  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:43):**  in the team or not the right team, which is a big thing and often mentioned.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:47):**  But the biggest reason is like timing and are you actually solving a problem someone  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:53):**  has, so to say.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:54):**  So lately there's been research as well on the amount of money that's been given and  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:17:59):**  you could say, which is a part of the startup studio model, sort of stage gates approach.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:03):**  So the stage gates idea is that first you really, really understand the problem you're  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:08):**  solving and you validated that it's actually a problem.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:12):**  So not just you think it's a problem or you read in one book that it is a problem.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:16):**  You know of the people that have this problem and you're quite certain that it's big enough,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:21):**  not just on a meta level, but also for specific groups.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:25):**  And then if you move towards that, then you can start trying to solve it.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:29):**  And that's another stage gate where you really need to validate, is this solution actually  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:33):**  solving this problem that we validated first.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:37):**  And just to stop you there for a second, if at the stage gate, let's say the first one,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:40):**  the answer is no, this is a problem that is just not big enough or not real enough.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:46):**  What happens?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:47):**  Well, you're abandoning obviously.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:48):**  So that's the big part.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:49):**  I think in general, the lean startup principles, you are willing to let go, keep an open mind  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:55):**  continuously and test your own validations, let go.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:18:59):**  The risk is always to fall in love with your idea.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:01):**  So it's finding a combination with obviously being very passionate and push forward, but  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:06):**  also being able to test your own assumptions, so to say.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:10):**  And to compare a little bit, I think the studio model goes even beyond that, because if you  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:15):**  look at the lean startup, for example, that's on an organizational level.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:18):**  So I don't know, an organization set out to do a certain goal and then it iterates a little  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:23):**  bit towards that.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:24):**  But if you look at a startup studio, you create a broader ecosystem of multiple companies  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:28):**  actually.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:29):**  And especially in this very early stage, it's not just about a process, but it's also about  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:34):**  iteration almost on a portfolio level, you could say, in this very early stage.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:38):**  So if, for example, a team is working on something, but they hit a dead end in a very early stage,  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:45):**  they can already switch to different areas and you can reallocate also resources, maybe  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:50):**  even people.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:51):**  So if you look at, for example, Entrepreneur First, Englert, Kainer programs, you see teams  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:55):**  that are still switching in these early days.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:19:58):**  So even co-founders in these early days can sort of iterate, so to say, after they hit  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:04):**  these roadblocks.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:05):**  So what you try to do is in a very early phase, hit as many roadblocks as you can, so to say,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:10):**  and preventing that you do it later.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:12):**  And I refer back to what I said earlier on.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:15):**  Also, the effect of giving money being sort of in line with where you are at.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:20):**  So if you give someone who is still validating a problem a lot of money, maybe too much money,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:27):**  they tend to move faster towards, for example, doing sales already and setting up sales channels  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:33):**  while the problem is not being validated yet.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:35):**  So if we talk about the roles of the investor, I think, and that's what studios do as well,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:39):**  allocate money proportionally to the stage gates you're in and moving forward accordingly,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:45):**  so to say.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:46):**  So basically unlocking as you move ahead.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:49):**  Yeah, unlocking.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:50):**  And then if you, for example, have a certain amount of money reserved for one organization,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:55):**  and you hit a dead end, you know, early enough, you can reallocate that money as well.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:20:59):**  And maybe the people as well, because they might be great people.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:01):**  It's not the people, they just validated that it doesn't work.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:05):**  Maybe they can start doing something else.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:07):**  Which is super valuable.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:08):**  I mean, it's extremely valuable if you in a year or six months or two months, whatever  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:12):**  the period is, you focused on, I don't know, a soil sensing technology or a crowd lending  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:18):**  platform or a food company and very specifically found out it's not the right timing or maybe  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:24):**  not the right product or maybe not the right service.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:27):**  And you can switch to other companies if you want to or other approaches or switch the  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:32):**  whole team to another approach within the same structure without losing the people,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:36):**  which I think we can't.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:38):**  It's interesting how it's sort of, it's an emerging mindset process, if I'm listening  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:42):**  correctly, which is very, very similar to how farmers that are applying regenerative  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:47):**  approaches are thinking about their land.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:49):**  Like they see on small tests, they see what works and what doesn't.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:52):**  Their most things don't and they put in more resources, more land, et cetera, into the  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:56):**  things that actually emerge, actually make sense.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:21:59):**  And not just read something in a book like, oh, this cover crop mix should work here.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:02):**  Let's plant all my land at the same time and do a huge investment and then be very disappointed  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:06):**  if it doesn't.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:07):**  The approach sounds very similar.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah, I think we can learn a lot from regenerative approach and from farmers and from different  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:14):**  industries.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:15):**  And it's also, as we said, sort of a mindset and that's something if we want to connect  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:20):**  to soil.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:21):**  I agree.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:22):**  It's about also the way we build businesses.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:26):**  And that's something I personally grew in the past years as well and changed my perspective  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:31):**  on as well as it's not just about, all right, this is a studio model and this is a way like  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:36):**  technology companies can be built or companies can build.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:39):**  All right, let's start building regenerative companies.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:41):**  And that's it.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:42):**  It's also the approach you take in how the companies are actually built.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:46):**  What does an organisation look like if we are trying to build a regenerative economy  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:50):**  or really an economy within planetary boundaries?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:53):**  What does that mean for the way you structure the businesses, the way you build the teams?  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:58):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:22:59):**  Let's go a bit deeper into that because you're basically saying that a startup studio that  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:04):**  produces like a factory, region food and egg companies is not good enough.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:09):**  What needs to happen to really make it a regenerative startup studio?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:14):**  Well, so I think one and a half year ago, we joined forces with Metabolic.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:19):**  It was a part of this project.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:21):**  And the first question we asked was based on the first one.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:24):**  So just what needs to happen?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:26):**  Tell us what we need to build and what is needed in the food space and we're going to  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:29):**  build it.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:30):**  But as our conversations progressed, we started having these discussions also.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:34):**  But what kind of organisations are we actually building?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:37):**  If we're trying to find systemic solutions, which we are focused on, how does an organisation  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:43):**  stay focused on having a systemic impact?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:45):**  And this is not just setting out for a goal in 20 years and keep on sailing towards a  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:50):**  goal.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:51):**  It's being able to adapt as well.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:52):**  So one of the things that we got into is obviously the organisation or the legal structure almost.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:23:58):**  That's also been a part in your podcast and that inspired us as well.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:03):**  The steward ownership model.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:04):**  So we've been in great contact with purpose and they partner with us in this as well.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:10):**  So all the organisations that we build, try to build them in a steward ownership structure.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:14):**  And also together with the investors that we have involved, really has a critical look  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:19):**  on how do we organise the organisation itself and how do we make sure that not just the  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:25):**  goal it has is towards a regenerative food system, but the organisation itself is able  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:31):**  to adapt and stay impact driven for the long term.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:35):**  And I think steward ownership for now is one of the tools we have in that direction as  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:39):**  a legal firm.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:41):**  And obviously there's still, there's also a lot of pioneering going on there as well.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:46):**  And we have to find it out together.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:48):**  But I think these are the questions you start asking.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:50):**  And now we start with steward ownership and, but it can go a lot deeper.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:54):**  So that's on the ownership side.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:55):**  That's I think a very important side.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:24:57):**  And then I think the ownership is fundamental because I remember from the interview and  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:01):**  I will link it below, obviously with Armin, which has been two years ago, maybe more like  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:05):**  the ownership question, who owns the steering wheel of your company when push comes to shovel,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:09):**  like when it really, really matters.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:11):**  Is it you as the investor?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:13):**  Is it your family?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:14):**  Why should it be you?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:15):**  Can it be sold if somebody puts half a billion on the table and does, do you lose the purpose  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:19):**  and the longterm view?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:21):**  And I find their work and other work around it on ownership extremely interesting.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:25):**  How do you make sure that the organisms and organisations we create, or we help create,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:30):**  keep their longterm view, even if the people change, even if investors change, even if  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:35):**  a lot of circumstances change, how do we create almost internal companies or organisations  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:40):**  that can really have the impact we need?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:42):**  Because this is not a five-year game or a 10-year game.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:45):**  We're playing a much longer game here and we need the underlying structures to help  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:49):**  that because otherwise we're just going to create another generation of companies that's  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:52):**  going to be sold by the first generation of entrepreneurs.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:54):**  And then most of the impact is going to be lost.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:57):**  I'm very happy.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:25:58):**  But I know it's very difficult because the legal, let's say the legal frameworks around  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:02):**  entrepreneurship aren't really ready for steward ownership yet in many cases.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:06):**  So you're not only bringing a startup studio model to reach an egg on food, but also actually  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:12):**  pioneering ownership structures.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:13):**  I think that the legal work could be quite challenging.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:16):**  Yeah, I think luckily it's on both sides.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:19):**  I think almost all sides, if you look at startup studio, it's really accelerating.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:23):**  The amount of studios are doubling every year.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:25):**  But also if you look at steward ownership, it's accelerating very much.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:30):**  Also the impact investors we've been in talks with when we got into conversations, I sort  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:35):**  of introduced them to steward ownership and you have a very interesting conversation.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:39):**  And now they are doing deals with companies way out of my reach, which are steward owned.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:45):**  So they have actually more experience in making actual deals that are steward owned, which  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:50):**  is very, very valuable, I think.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:26:53):**  So it is growing and the wave is coming and it's coming out of the, just the conversations,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:00):**  but it's getting into actual deals being made and actual examples.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:04):**  And I don't, I think we shouldn't be too dogmatic about it.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:07):**  Like it has to be this way or that way.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:09):**  We have to really invite investors as well to help solve this question.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:13):**  And yeah, I think that's an interesting part of what we're trying to do with everyone,  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:18):**  I think in the ecosystem, asking these questions and trying to answer them in a broader sense  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:23):**  as well.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:24):**  So how do we organize the organizations, how we set up the legal structure?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:28):**  And I think sort of a second part that you need, if you want to have a long-term impact  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:33):**  and stay focused on having a systemic impact.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:37):**  The ownership model is not good enough.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:38):**  No, the ownership model is not going to cut it.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:41):**  It's facilitating it, I think, but obviously the culture and the mindset or the intention  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:47):**  of the founders is very important.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:50):**  That's something I've grown to learn as well.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:52):**  So if we look at sort of systemic solutions, you can look at the system and then look at  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:27:58):**  intervention areas or the leverage points and how to effectively work in the system  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:04):**  or try to change or influence the system.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:07):**  But I think something that, and that's why I like regenerative agriculture as well, and  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:11):**  also the podcast, because it can turn quite philosophical sometimes, but it's also a perspective  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:17):**  and a mindset shift that we need to go through, but also these new founders need to go through.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:24):**  So building a culture and a mindset is probably as important, I think.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:31):**  Meaning that these founders and these teams need to be willing or already are going through  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:37):**  certain, let's say, getting to certain levels of consciousness to be able to build regenerative  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:42):**  businesses.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:44):**  I think I remember a bit of the discussion you and Ethan had in a recent podcast on  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:51):**  like regenerative approaches or practices.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:55):**  And I think I stopped saying it.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:57):**  So I say no approaches.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:28:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:01):**  He corrected me.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:02):**  He corrected you and I learned from that as well.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:03):**  But I think that's part of the thing, right?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:05):**  It's about having an approach.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:06):**  And I think that's not just about farming.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:08):**  It's in general change that we're going through as humanity, I would say.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:13):**  And if we use that and look at organisations, then again, that's something we have to take  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:18):**  into account in how we build organisations and the people that are building these organisations  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:23):**  play a role in that and are very important in that, actually.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:26):**  So you have to be able to change course.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:28):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:29):**  I will put another interview in the show notes that Regenerate, the forum, just did with  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:34):**  Frederic Laloux, the writer of Reinventing Organisations.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:38):**  And his interest, actually, he's getting very interested in soil as well.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:41):**  It doesn't come from a farming background, but he is fully focused on how do you build  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:45):**  these steel organisations, organisations that are almost like organisms, usually without  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:50):**  managers, usually really adapting very, very well.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:54):**  Some very large organisations are managed in that way or are not managed in that way,  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:58):**  let's say.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:29:59):**  But I found it very interesting that he's getting super interested in agriculture, soil  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:03):**  and food.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:04):**  So I will link that interview below for anybody that's interested in that.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:07):**  I think it's a great book as well, by the way, Reinventing Organisations, if you're interested  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:11):**  in them.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:12):**  And they have a great video series if you're interested in that.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:15):**  But to ask a question, how can people help?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:17):**  People are listening to this.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:18):**  You said you're looking for 30, 40 people for the first cohort, let's say, I don't know  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:22):**  if you call it like that, but this year, what kind of people are you looking for from Europe,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:27):**  you mentioned?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:28):**  How could people get involved if they're interested?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:30):**  Yeah, obviously, if people are looking to become a founder in the space, reach out.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:37):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:38):**  We expect to open sort of the sourcing or open the call, I think, in the second quarter  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:42):**  of this year.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:44):**  So that's one way to get involved.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:46):**  Another thing we're currently working on, and I think so in general, we're trying to  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:50):**  build an ecosystem or be a part of a broader ecosystem of both, well, pioneers in the field  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:56):**  and investors.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:30:57):**  So we're already speaking to a lot of organisations.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:01):**  But if you run into maybe even business cases that you recognise and what I've noticed is  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:06):**  also for pioneers that are in a certain space, they see a lot of opportunities that they  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:12):**  simply cannot act upon in many cases because of time or it's so far away from their core  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:18):**  business.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:19):**  But we're doing the opportunity due diligence, as we're called, and we're very much interested  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:23):**  in getting in touch with more organisations that are working on this transition and are  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:30):**  open to share, well, challenges and maybe parts of solutions that they see, but that  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:35):**  they are not working on themselves currently that can be accelerated by finding new teams  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:40):**  that really match these ideas.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:42):**  So that's the second part, I think.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:44):**  And then the third part that's on the investor side, I think we involved a small group of  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:48):**  impact investors now that directly invest into the ventures that we build.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:52):**  But it's also we'd really invite them on a journey as well on what we want them to integrate  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:31:59):**  that due diligence into our process, so to say.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:01):**  So on the legal side, already have all the difficult discussions on stewardship and develop  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:07):**  that model together as well.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:09):**  And yeah, be part of this journey a little bit and learn how we can actually build better  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:14):**  ventures that, yeah, obviously they are looking for as well being deal flow for them.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:20):**  Which should help with the fundraising because if you're part of that process as an investor,  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:25):**  let's say you should already have a good idea after whatever months or year the cohort  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:30):**  runs, which companies you are interested in backing and which not.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:34):**  So hopefully it also limits the endless time fundraising sometimes takes.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:38):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:39):**  That's obviously the idea of them involved.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:41):**  And we have two tiers, so to say.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:44):**  So very early stage, obviously this is so early stage.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:47):**  So for many investors, it's like, what do you mean we get involved and you don't have  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:51):**  the company, you're going to build the company.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:53):**  And that's a challenge the startup studio movement has and is tackling right now.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:32:58):**  And that's why they're becoming very vocal as well in explaining why this is a good way  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:03):**  to invest actually.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:05):**  So it's actually better to not have the company yet.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:07):**  Yeah, the recent report by the global startup studio network, the guy that wrote it in his  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:13):**  introduction, he compared it to betting on either the horse or the jockey.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:18):**  So are you betting on the ID or the team and then the percentages of how they secure success,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:24):**  so to say.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:25):**  So how do you know if it's going to be successful?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:26):**  Is it the horse or the jockey?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:30):**  But then apparently I think the horse is like 32%.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:34):**  Like if it's a really good horse, it's 32%.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:36):**  If it's really good jockey, it's 24, 25.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:38):**  It's quite similar to ID and team.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:41):**  But there's also a coach who's putting the horse and the jockey together.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:46):**  And apparently good coaches also in the horse riding business, they get up to 53% success  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:53):**  rates because they know this horse with this jockey that is going to work.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:33:58):**  And that is what the studio model is trying to sell as well.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:01):**  Like invest in the methodology and then the output is going to be better than directly  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:07):**  investing.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:08):**  And it's a harder case to make also for us.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:10):**  No, no, I understand because it's such a paradigm shift coming from, but I'm investing in early  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:14):**  stage companies or I'm betting on teams.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:17):**  Now actually you should be investing in a process to get many of these companies and  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:23):**  teams going on something that actually matters.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:26):**  But it's a very much, it's not something we've been taught in investor school or something  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:30):**  we've been taught in how companies are actually being built.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:33):**  But if you look at globally the last 10, 15 years, a lot of startup studios have been  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:37):**  very, very, very successful with much lower risk, much lower failure rates, which I think  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:42):**  is for investors always interesting, but also more very successful in helping to build a  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:47):**  lot of successful companies.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:49):**  So it's something to look into, although it's so unknown for many.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:54):**  I mean, unknown for many in general, even if you're active in the software world, but  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:34:58):**  imagine in the region ag and food world where it's completely unknown.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:01):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:02):**  But also maybe in parts it isn't.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:06):**  For example, if you look at an organization like Komenland, I think they were quite well  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:10):**  known and if you look at their approach and obviously they're focused on the landscape,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:14):**  but they generate new businesses as well while they're changing the landscape and they obviously  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:22):**  have different outputs and different crops or returns coming from the land and they build  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:27):**  companies to also build a market for that.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:30):**  And that's already working.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:32):**  It's about standardizing that.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:35):**  And also that's, I think, a big challenge in showing that it works, obviously.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:39):**  So it's now it's very early stage and a big risk because the returns are coming in these  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:45):**  past 10 years, but also finding a business model for this very, very, very early stage  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:50):**  and having that work.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:51):**  That's part of the challenge, I think, that we are trying to solve.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:54):**  And to ask a question about that, let's say you had almost unlimited resources.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:35:59):**  So you had an investment fund of a billion dollars or a billion euros in this case.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:03):**  What would you focus on tomorrow morning?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:04):**  What would you focus on today if you would be an investor with pretty much unlimited  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:09):**  resources?  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:10):**  If I'm very honest, I would really try to progress the studio model on different scale  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:16):**  and different niche and if it develops.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:20):**  So as I said, not just putting the billions at work immediately, but trying to set up  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:25):**  multiple versions, maybe some very local focused or focused on a specific area, some on specific  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:32):**  intervention areas and developing the model and then having the rest of the money ready  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:37):**  to invest in the companies that come out of the process.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:41):**  So yeah, obviously that's what we're doing.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:44):**  But not with a billion dollars.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:45):**  Not yet.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:46):**  No, not yet.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:47):**  So probably about a billion dollars, I would find someone to do what I'm doing right now  
**[0:36:51-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:51):**  and try to set up a few different versions simultaneously and make sure that they directly  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:36:59):**  learn from each other as well and build a bigger ecosystem already and then have the  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:03):**  money to invest what comes out of it.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:05):**  And then also optimize for the throughput that you have and building a broader ecosystem.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:11):**  Also by obviously inspiring people, doing the co-founder matching.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:15):**  There are multiple ingredients, so to say, that we can feed the soil of venture building,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:22):**  so to say, in a broader sense and not just only the venture building.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:26):**  And yeah, I think that's where my money would go.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:30):**  Definitely to a staged approach, getting more studios focused on up and running, focused  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:36):**  on Food and Ag and being ready to do follow up investments.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:39):**  So now, unfortunately we took away your fund, but we gave you a magic wand and some magic  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:44):**  power.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:45):**  If you could create one thing overnight in the agriculture and food space, what would  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:49):**  that be?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:50):**  Yeah, the magic wand, that's a difficult one, I think.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:37:54):**  First off, this is something I look at, Hupp as well, like the wand being a sort of solution  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:00):**  focused or this is going to be the solution.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:03):**  And I know the solution.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:04):**  I don't think that is actually the case.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:07):**  So I would be very hesitant to use a magic wand personally, afraid of creating more problems  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:11):**  than solving.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:12):**  Okay, I mean, the answer could be, I don't want to, yeah.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:16):**  Could be a policy thing, could be a consciousness thing, could be, I mean, it could be anything  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:20):**  obviously.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:21):**  Yeah, personally, I would say the consciousness is probably the most important one if we've  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:27):**  all changed perspective.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:28):**  And I'm personally, I'm not even there yet, but I think if you change the perspective,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:33):**  then we're going to build different companies.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:35):**  We're going to build a different food system, obviously.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:39):**  And yeah, if you need a super practical example, maybe enabling more and more people to also  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:45):**  free up their time to go through this process and to start building organisations.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:50):**  So I don't know if we would wave a wand and have a sort of a basic income for everyone,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:38:56):**  universal basic income that everyone can get on their journey and also actually start building  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:01):**  organisations a little bit easier than it is now.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:04):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:05):**  The first time I think that UBI, universal basic income came up in the magic wand answer,  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:10):**  but it's a really, really valid one.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:12):**  I think we need, I'm very frustrated often when I look at the entrepreneurial space within  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:17):**  region food and act, because there's, it's just very, very limited.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:20):**  There is a lot of happening, but if you compare it to other sectors or what needs to be done,  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:24):**  mostly, it's very, very limited.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:25):**  And you're absolutely right.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:26):**  If more people, especially people with experience in building things, building teams, companies,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:33):**  invest, family offices, food companies, I don't care, but building things in the region  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:38):**  food and act space, we would be much better off, but giving people more, the opportunity  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:44):**  to do that would, that could be UBI could be an interesting tool.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:47):**  Thank you so much for the answer.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:49):**  And thank you.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:50):**  I want to be conscious of your time, for your time today and diving deeper into the studio  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:54):**  model.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:55):**  I don't think it's the last time we're going to be checking in for sure, because I'm very,  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:39:58):**  very curious when, of course, when the cohort starts and when the first things come out  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:40:02):**  of it, because then it becomes very real and often probably many things you thought about  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:40:07):**  are not working as they should or as you thought, and then you're going to be iterated.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:40:10):**  So I'm very much looking forward to check in when the works are really, really starting  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:40:15):**  with life cases, processes, gates that are going to be open and closed, investments made,  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:40:20):**  et cetera, et cetera.

**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:41:57):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:42:01):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:42:05):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:42:09):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:42:13):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:42:18):**  time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:17):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:21):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:26):**  different means.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:27):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:30):**  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:35):**  Thank you.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:36):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:37):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:44):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:45):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:50):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:43:56):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:44:00):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:44:02):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:44:07):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bart-van-der-zande#t=0:44:11):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.

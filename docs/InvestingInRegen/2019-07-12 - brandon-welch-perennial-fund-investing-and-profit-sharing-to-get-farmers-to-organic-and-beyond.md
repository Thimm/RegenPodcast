### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 12:20:04)
## Brandon Welch, Perennial fund, investing and profit sharing to get farmers to organic and beyond  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:00):**  You're gonna listen to a super short interview on transition finance.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:04):**  How do we get many more farmers and farmland transitioned to organic and regenerative,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:09):**  in a way which makes sense to the farmer, the investor, and the soil?  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:14):**  That's the question we're trying to answer here.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:18):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:22):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:23):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:28):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:33):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:38):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:40):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:44):**  our land, grow our food, and what we eat.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:46):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:51):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:00:56):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:00):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:04):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:07):**  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:11):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:12):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:17):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:33):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:37):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:39):**  Welcome to a short episode of the podcast.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:40):**  I'm joined today by Brendan Wells of Mad Agriculture who's working on the Perennial Fund which  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:45):**  has as a subtitle accelerating regenerative and organic agriculture.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm obviously super interested to find out more.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:51):**  So without further ado, welcome Brendan.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:53):**  Hey, Colin.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:54):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:55):**  So to start with a question on the Perennial Fund.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:01:59):**  As we try to keep this short, I promise the listeners to record another episode at some  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:04):**  point to dive deep into the why and how and all the back pieces behind the scenes of this  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:09):**  fund.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:10):**  But I want to keep this short and to the point and try to keep it within 10, let's say 10,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:15):**  15 minutes.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:16):**  So I'm asking a very practical question immediately.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:18):**  What is the Perennial Fund?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:19):**  What is it going to be?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:20):**  And why is it so different?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:23):**  What are the key pieces?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:24):**  Yeah, so how Mad Agriculture largely works is we engage with farmers to create whole  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:30):**  farm design plans to help them in both space and time, grow new crops in a regenerative  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:37):**  way.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:38):**  And over the past couple of years, through all of our learnings, we've really seen that  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:43):**  there's three key pieces to accelerating regenerative ag and organic ag.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:49):**  And that's by connecting capital, know-how, and markets.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:53):**  And we found that without bringing all three together, it's really hard to create that  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:02:58):**  systemic change, that long lasting change that farmers are going to adopt, that are  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:04):**  going to make investors happy and are going to give a return to their portfolio.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:09):**  And that brands and commodity buyers are going to want to set up contracts with to buy those  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:15):**  crops.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:16):**  So the Perennial Fund is a way of connecting all those pieces in a way that is equitable  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:22):**  for all the players involved, and not just trying to unload risk onto farmers, onto brands,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:26):**  or onto investors, but trying to create a fair, equitable distribution of the many different  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:34):**  types of value that are created from adopting regenerative ag, whether that be social, environmental,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:39):**  or actual, just healthy, quality food that is coming off the land.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:46):**  So the general concept of the Perennial Fund is to help conventional growers transition  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:52):**  to organic in a way that makes sense for them financially.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:03:56):**  So what we're looking to do is lend a conventional farmer $100 per acre per year for the 36-month  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:05):**  organic transition in exchange for 20% of their net profits on the back end once they're  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:12):**  certified organic until 1.5x the initial investment is paid back.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:17):**  So it's essentially the Perennial Fund will lend the grower $300 per acre over the course  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:23):**  of 36 months in exchange for $450 for the next five to seven years, depending on the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:31):**  payback, until that amount is met.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:34):**  Now, there's a few key pieces here.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:36):**  Yeah, let's unpack it a bit, because I think it's, I mean, you reached out to me and mentioned  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:41):**  we're doing a revenue share, a profit share, and I was immediately interested.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:45):**  So I think there are a few pieces to unpack here.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:48):**  First of all, I think the $100 that I'm imagining comes from your experience in what is necessary  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:55):**  per acre, more or less, depending on the grower, etc.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:04:58):**  But let's see that $100 that comes from your experience, what's necessary to start and  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:03):**  kick off this organic and regenerative transition?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:05):**  Yeah, so the $100 really comes from looking in multiple regions.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:10):**  We did a lot of research in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and that number, in  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:17):**  general, is what covers the net profit gap that a lot of farmers are going to experience  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:23):**  during that transition phase from generally reduced yields at conventional prices.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:30):**  So you could see a 20 to 30% yield drop during your transition, and then you're going to  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:34):**  come out negative for the year per acre.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:37):**  But this $100 is able to cover that to make sure that while you're transitioning, that  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:42):**  you're going to be able to put food on the table and pay for your living expenses and  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:45):**  pay your rent if you're renting your farmland.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:49):**  So that's where the $100 per acre really comes from.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:52):**  And then another key piece of this model is after your transitions to organic, you're  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:05:58):**  only paying back the loan if you are profitable, because it's based on net profits.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:04):**  So we're buying in to the farmer that we've done robust due diligence on and showing that  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:11):**  if they're not net profitable, then we're not going to get paid back.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:14):**  We're really getting in the saddle with them and making sure that these practices and these  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:19):**  crops that that farmer is growing are going to be able to be sold at a market premium.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:25):**  They're going to deliver cost savings on the management, and it's going to be sustainable  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:31):**  in the long run.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:32):**  It's not just going to be a one off thing just to transition to organic and then see  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:37):**  you later.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:38):**  So that is key.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:40):**  And that all of those pieces really come together in the initial phase of how we generally engage  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:45):**  with growers.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:46):**  And that's through carbon farm planning and our four phase process of visioning with the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:53):**  farmer, understanding their goals for the land, their ethics for the land, where they  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:06:58):**  want to go, how they see their family being involved.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:01):**  And those real types of values that why are they in agriculture and why do they want to  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:06):**  continue to be within agriculture.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:08):**  The design phase of the farm, which is mapping out in space and time the crops and practices  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:15):**  and the finances of the farm and enterprise budgets for various crops and creating rotations  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:20):**  and pulling it all together while keeping capital and markets in mind.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:26):**  The action phase of actual implementation and then the adaptation phase for the years  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:32):**  after farmers are transitioned to organic or have adopted more regenerative practices.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:37):**  So the know how and carbon farm piece is it's difficult, but it's easier than the actual  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:45):**  activation of that carbon farm plan because that takes capital and that takes markets.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:50):**  And that's where this perennial fund really steps in is it's able to activate that and  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:07:55):**  help farmers realize the designs of their farm and their land and where they want to  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:00):**  go.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:01):**  And let's spend a bit of time on the markets because you mentioned that it's so obvious,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:06):**  but so often forgotten.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:07):**  It's great if you go through the transition and in many places that's three years you  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:11):**  go to organic and in this case there's actually a carbon plan behind it.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:15):**  So you're actually going to reverse regenerative, but then if you cannot sell your produce,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:19):**  produce for a premium and actually during the years of transition you cannot sell it  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:24):**  even as organic, you basically be left without a real viable farm.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:29):**  So that's why you partnered up with Pipeline Foods who we actually interviewed on the podcast  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:33):**  twice now as I'm very happy to see Eric back in the game.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:37):**  And so can you say a bit about that partnership or the importance of having those offtake  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:42):**  agreements ready for the farmers to move?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:45):**  Yeah, it's, you know, the market side is critical because if you're helping a conventional  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:50):**  grower transition to organic, they now have to deal with those three years of selling  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:08:54):**  conventional crops to the typical buyers that they've normally sold to, or they then have  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:00):**  to somehow find access to transitional markets to gain some type of a premium to make up  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:05):**  for the yield gap.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:06):**  So we've been working on partnering up with Pipeline Foods to talk about them purchasing  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:13):**  the transitional crops from these growers and then the organic crops once these growers  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:18):**  are certified organic and setting up a longterm contracts to do so.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:22):**  And that's really important because you know, you've been selling your corn to the local  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:27):**  elevator for the last 20 years and now all of a sudden when you go certified organic,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:33):**  you have to figure out the logistics, the transportation, the storage and the contracting  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:38):**  and understanding what type of prices are reasonable and equitable for that crop.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:43):**  There's a lot of logistics there and that's a lot of work that a farmer just shouldn't  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:47):**  have to take on on their own.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:49):**  So we're trying to reduce the amount of friction that is usually within that system when a  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:09:54):**  grower transitions and just enable them to make the switch as easily as possible by increasing  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:02):**  the stability of their revenues through these longterm premiums.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:07):**  Whether that be through the organic commodity market, which is pretty robust and has been  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:14):**  so for the past couple of decades or through stacking on additional revenues through improvement  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:21):**  of ecosystem services and buyers of those ecosystem services, people that want to improve  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:28):**  the health of the soil or water or land or biodiversity in general.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:32):**  So we've also partnered up with Nori, which is a new carbon marketplace that is helping  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:37):**  reduce the verification costs and enable soil carbon credits to be created and then sold  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:44):**  in a way that is much better than previous markets for a whole plethora of reasons.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:51):**  And that's a whole other podcast we could go into.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:54):**  But yeah, we're bringing them on board.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:10:56):**  So these farmers that are now transitioning to organic and let's say they're using minimum  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:03):**  tillage and cover cropping and have a five or six year rotation, the likelihood of them  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:08):**  sequestering CO2 in their soil carbon is pretty high.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:13):**  And we will be able to quantify and verify and then bring that onto the marketplace through  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:19):**  a combination of Nori's verification methodology using Comet Farm, Quick Carbon at Yale University,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:26):**  and then stacking that together and generating impact reports to show the actual numbers  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:33):**  on carbon and the impacts these regenerative practices have on the soil.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:37):**  Which is key.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:38):**  And I'm really trying to keep it short because there's so much to unpack in basically every  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:42):**  sentence here.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:43):**  But we're going to do that at some point.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:45):**  But I want to get two more points before we close this one.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:49):**  One a bit on return.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:50):**  I mean, people can do the calculation themselves.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:53):**  You mentioned a one and a half, 1.5 cap basically on the initial investment.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:11:58):**  But what are you typically, let's say in the models now looking at?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:02):**  And then two, where are you currently at and how can people help and how can people get  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:06):**  involved?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah, that's good.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:08):**  So right now, the way that we've quantified it in our models is that it's a high likelihood  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:14):**  that farmers will be able to pay back the entire loan at 20% of their net profits within  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:20):**  five years after their transition.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:21):**  So it'd be an eight year total note.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:24):**  And if they're able to pay that back, so pay $450 back off of the initial 300 per acre,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:32):**  that'd be an 11% IRR over eight years.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:36):**  What we are trying to do is extend that length to actually make sure that it's a 10 year  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:42):**  note.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:43):**  So the farmer has the option to pay it off early.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:45):**  But in the case of extreme unexpected events like hail or drought or heatwave, there are  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:52):**  two additional years built in there so that if they're not net profitable on specific  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:12:58):**  acreage or their entire farm for a year, they have a little bit of leeway to make sure that  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:03):**  they'll have those additional years to pay back.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:05):**  And over the course of 10 years, that'll be a 9% IRR.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:10):**  So it's a pretty quality return over the course of those years.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:14):**  And it's equitable for the investor because they're getting a significant return over  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:23):**  that time period.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:24):**  And then it's equitable for the farmer because they're only paying back if they're profitable  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:28):**  for those years.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, it really puts the farmer and investor on the same side of the table, which I think  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:33):**  is going to be very interesting to watch how that plays out.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:39):**  So where we are right now is we're right now we are applying for a conservation innovation  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:44):**  grant through the NRCS, a CIG grant.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:47):**  We are currently asking for $750,000 from that grant as a loan guarantee for this investment.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:13:56):**  So what that is going to do is cover 30% of the entire funds that we are going to raise  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:03):**  in the case that a portion of that is lost from investors, which is what we are trying  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:09):**  to hedge against in every way we possibly can.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:13):**  But to enable this kind of investment, we're going to use a credit enhancement of a loan  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:17):**  guarantee.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:18):**  So we're going to be raising and we are actively raising two and a half million dollars to  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:23):**  actually invest into conversion of conventional to organic that'll enable about 8,300 acres  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:30):**  to convert to organic.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:33):**  And as the first loss capital in the form of a loan guarantee, we're going to be using  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:37):**  750,000 from the CIG grant.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:40):**  So we actually just got one of our first farms to commit.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:44):**  It's Delicus Farms up in Northern Montana.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:47):**  They're a diversified organic operation that have been doing it for about 10 years.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:52):**  They're in multiple folks supply chains that you've probably heard of, like Timeless Seeds,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:14:59):**  Patagonia Provisions, Clif Bar.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:01):**  They're all very involved and they're very sophisticated farmers and they're also just  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:09):**  really good people to talk with.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:10):**  So they're looking at taking over about 2,100 acres of chem fellow land that has been that  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:17):**  way for the past 20 years and they're going to convert it to organic.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:21):**  So we're exploring that option with them and have a provisional yes from them.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:27):**  And it's looking very helpful.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:29):**  So that would be one of our first investments and we're actively seeking other farmers to  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:36):**  get involved in ring conversation with a few others.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:39):**  So Pipeline Foods has generously offered and has sent out a newsletter to a thousand plus  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:45):**  of their growers in their supply chain to solicit this investment idea to see if any  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:51):**  of the current successful organic growers are looking to rent or buy conventional land  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:15:57):**  and then transition to organic or if some of their conventional growers are looking  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:02):**  to convert some acreage to organic.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:04):**  So it's well on its way.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:05):**  We're talking with various investor groups across the country and things are coming together  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:11):**  pretty rapidly.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:12):**  So I urge anybody that's listening, if they want to get involved in terms of an investment  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:19):**  or a PRI or just a donation to help support some of our time because at Madag we are a  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:26):**  non-profit or a 501c3, that would be great.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:30):**  We're willing to learn, looking to explore and open to any ideas that folks have.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:34):**  So we're actively in that phase of pushing and pulling and seeing where everyone is and  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:42):**  who we should get involved because we're really looking to bring in mission aligned partners  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:46):**  as well, not just looking for four dollar signs.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:49):**  I mean, it matters where those come from and what the expectations are.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:53):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:54):**  And with that, obviously this is not investment advice, but I'm very curious to see how this  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:16:59):**  will work.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:00):**  I'll put your contact details and more information on the fund in the description below.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:06):**  And I want to thank you so much for your time today, Brendan.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:09):**  And very curious.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:10):**  I mean, I think the file is due.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:12):**  It's now the 8th of July, the end of this month.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:15):**  So the end of July 2019.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:17):**  You need to submit for the grant.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:19):**  It's very, very exciting, but also very busy times, I think, for you.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:23):**  Definitely busy times.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:24):**  And regardless, you know, the submittal is July 30th.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:27):**  But regardless of the grant, we are still going to be pursuing this idea, whether it's  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:32):**  using foundation philanthropic capital as the loan guarantee or first loss capital or  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:38):**  private investment in raising a different fund structure of sorts.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:41):**  We'll still be pursuing this, but it'd be ideal if we can get this all together by July  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:46):**  30th.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:47):**  That'd be the dream.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/13/brandon-welch/#t=0:17:48):**  I wish you a lot of luck.

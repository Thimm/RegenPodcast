**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:14):**  First of a series of deep dives into new foundation farms raising 20 million pounds to buy a thousand  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:18):**  acres in the UK to build a regenerative agri-food enterprise, which will produce food and fibre  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:24):**  in a way that supports soils, communities and health.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:27):**  They call it radically natural farming.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:30):**  So let's find out more on why they focus on scale, vertical integration and what a regenerative  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:35):**  enterprise means to them.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture – Investing as  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:43):**  if the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:47):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:52):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:07):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:12):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:42):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:43):**  Today a very special episode, the first in a short series where we unpack new foundation  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:47):**  farms in the UK, starting with the executive chair, Mark Drewel.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome Mark.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:53):**  Hi, good.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:54):**  Nice to be here.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:01:55):**  And the question I ask everyone, and in this case, I'm obviously very, very interested.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:00):**  Why are you doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:02):**  Why you ended up being so deeply involved in rebuilding soils?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:07):**  Well, short version or long version?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:09):**  I'll give you the long version.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:10):**  Long version.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:11):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:12):**  So I grew up in the UK in the countryside and I watched the countryside decline.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:17):**  That's quite short actually.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:19):**  But there's a much longer one coming.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:22):**  The longer bit that goes on from that is I spent 20 years in South Africa and I got very  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:26):**  involved in the political transition there.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:29):**  So much so that as a young manager of 27 years old, I co-created a community forum that became  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:36):**  replicated 4,000 times and was the peace committee structures that managed the political transition  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:41):**  out of apartheid.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:42):**  And that taught me something really fundamental.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:45):**  And that was that you can use business to be a massive agent for change in times of  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:50):**  profound transition.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:52):**  So that was kind of like then informed the rest of my business career from that stage  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:58):**  on.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:02:59):**  And so I got things like the Cambridge University Institute for Sustainability Leadership into  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:02):**  South Africa because really obsessed with this issue of the way we built the economic  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:07):**  system doesn't work.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:08):**  And of course that meant I got exposed to climate change experts.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:12):**  And that made me really miserable, but it also made me realize that we needed to do  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:15):**  something.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:17):**  And it's not a short leap from there to realize that the core structural problem that the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:22):**  way we grow our food is at the heart of our own extinction in the future is something  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:27):**  that could be interesting to be engaged with.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:29):**  So it's been a long journey, which involved also one stage owning a 1500 acre regenerative  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:35):**  farm in South Africa and learning the hard way what you can do and could do then and  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:40):**  couldn't do and recognizing that actually we can do something really disruptive.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:45):**  I mean, this was relatively short.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:46):**  I mean, I think we're going to pack a lot of things here, but it's interesting how I've  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:50):**  heard that story, not exactly this, but the story before people ended up looking at business,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:56):**  being very concerned, very depressed and very miserable.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:03:58):**  I think many people listening to this will be nodding now about climate change.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:02):**  And then I wouldn't say discovering or stumble upon the role of food and ag and the potential  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:06):**  there and then suddenly finding, I would say hope and optimism, maybe a mix of those to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:11):**  actually there's stuff we can do here in a lifetime and in the next lifetimes that make  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:16):**  a lot of sense.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:17):**  And then you decided after owning this massive farm and you could have stayed there, you  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:22):**  decided, no, I want to disrupt the food system in, let's say Europe and specifically the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:27):**  UK.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:28):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:30):**  When I was 40, I was sort of a C-suite executive in a big diversified industrial business.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:36):**  Like last year.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:38):**  Like last year, only a few years before that.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:41):**  And I told all my friends I'd leave corporate life when I turned 45.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:44):**  So I did because I wanted to do something different and kind of semi-retired to the  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:50):**  coast in South Africa, beautiful surfing beach in Cape Town.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:04:55):**  But I found myself in this conversation with my children, like in my mind 20 years later.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:00):**  And they were saying, dad, did you know what was going to happen in the world around climate  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:05):**  change?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:06):**  And I said, well, yes, I did.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:09):**  And they said, well, what did you do?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:10):**  But I was surfing.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:11):**  So yeah.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:12):**  Yeah, what did you do?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:13):**  So I stayed involved in an initiative that was transforming business education.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:19):**  And they said to me, would you come and run it in Europe, in Belgium, in fact?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:22):**  And so I said to my wife, we need to talk.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:25):**  She said, where are we going?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:27):**  And I said, how about Belgium?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:29):**  And she said, well, thank God it's not England.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:32):**  And at the time, she's South African, the reason was that her perception of England  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:36):**  was a place where nothing innovative was happening.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:39):**  And it was a sort of dead old dinosaur empire, sort of waste of space country.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:46):**  But coming back and spending a few years living in Belgium and spending more time here, she  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:50):**  discovered there were people who actually had an ambition to do something different.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:05:54):**  And then with all the stupidity of Brexit and the rise of kind of absurd nationalism,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:01):**  at the same time, we also realised that people are really looking for an opportunity for  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:05):**  change.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:06):**  And in the UK, 60% of, for example, English farms are not profitable without subsidies.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:12):**  And the subsidies are all going, at least being replaced by something that requires  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:16):**  ecological outcomes.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:17):**  So this place is so ripe for change and people are looking for it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:22):**  It's really exciting.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:24):**  So let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:25):**  You say 60% of farms survive on subsidies, basically.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:27):**  You wrote a very nice paper on that and a few articles, which I'll definitely link below.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:32):**  So it's ripe for change.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:34):**  Subsidy systems are changing.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:36):**  So that's the, let's say the incentive part.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:39):**  What about the other part?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:40):**  What about the farmers, the land stewards?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:42):**  What about the consumers?  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:43):**  Why now?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:44):**  It cannot be just a story about incentives because then they might have changed before  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:47):**  or then it might have changed or they will never change.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:50):**  What's the why now that I always like to dig a bit deeper in?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:53):**  So why now in the UK?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:55):**  Really honest answer, first level is because we live here.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:06:58):**  Very good answer in terms of roots, in terms of, yeah.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:02):**  So all entrepreneurialism is about people coming together with an interest to do something.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:08):**  And the reality is most people think afterwards they tell clever stories about how they created  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:12):**  things.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:13):**  But the real truth is entrepreneurs get together because they share a passion for something  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:17):**  and then they start doing it.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:19):**  And usually what they end up doing is completely different from where they started.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:22):**  So three years ago when we started really thinking about agriculture in the UK, we had  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:28):**  a really clear picture that there was all this international experience around regenerative  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:33):**  approaches that we could bring into the UK and it would all be about farming.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:38):**  And it was motivated by this view that actually we wanted to demonstrate something here that  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:44):**  others could be inspired to imitate or follow or learn from.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:49):**  And so that why for us was all about the sort of imperative to do something to make a difference  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:56):**  and the fact that we happened to be here at the time.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:07:59):**  And then when you start looking, you think, hmm, it's actually possible to do something  
**[0:08:02-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:02):**  because okay, as you mentioned, as we talked, the context is from a producer point of view.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:11):**  We talked about 60 to 58% to be precise of English farms are not profitable without subsidies,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:17):**  but equally 80% of the top soils gone in the UK in the last 150 years, 8-0.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:24):**  Now I just want to emphasize it's not one eight, it's eight zero just to be...  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:27):**  Eight zero in 150 years.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:30):**  That's mind boggling when you stop and think about it.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:33):**  But then when you start to investigate it, you say, hang on, it's not surprising because  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:37):**  for 12,000 years across the world, we've been doing this.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:40):**  And every time we put a plow in the ground, we set back soil biology by 15 years and we  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:45):**  didn't understand that, but we now do.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:47):**  And so now it's time.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:49):**  Coming back to the discussion with your children.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:53):**  But Kun, it's also about, you say why now?  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:08:54):**  It's also because it's very clear to us that not only in terms of the production side,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:00):**  if you like the supply, but on the demand end of this equation, you just look at any  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:05):**  indicator you care to name about patterns of how we as people, I hate the word consumers,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:11):**  by the way, so I'm not going to say consumers.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:13):**  We as people in our role of buying food are looking for better ways of doing it.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:18):**  And whether that's the growth in demand for organic and demand for consumption of locally  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:23):**  grown food, the pattern is the same way.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:25):**  And particularly in the next, call it the millennial generation, the interest in wellbeing  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:32):**  and health and the connection of that to the environment is central and it's not being  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:37):**  met by the mainstream.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:39):**  That's what we think needs to be done.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:41):**  So to set a bit the stage, what are you building in the UK?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:45):**  Just in, I mean, we'll unpack it in many different ways, but just to set the stage a bit, what  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:49):**  are we talking about?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:50):**  Is this a nice vertical farm?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:52):**  Is it a container somewhere?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:53):**  Is it a hip food brand?  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:55):**  What are we discussing here?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:09:57):**  So what we're discussing is building a disruptive regenerative agri-food enterprise.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:04):**  So three words, disruptive regenerative agri-food.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:07):**  Well, four words, if you add the word enterprise.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:10):**  Which I would like to unpack as well.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:13):**  So let's do four.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:14):**  So what does disruptive mean?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:15):**  The starting point for that is to build something that is of a scale and visibility and degree  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:21):**  of radical difference that it changes the logic of the agri-food system.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:26):**  So that's the first element of it.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:28):**  And I'll describe how in a minute.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:30):**  Regenerative for us, that means let's be clear about definitions for us.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:35):**  The definition of regenerative agriculture is the growing of affordable, high quality,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:41):**  nutrient dense food on regenerating soils.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:45):**  It's an outcomes based definition.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:47):**  And we live in a world where the word regenerative is being used by all sorts of people for all  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:52):**  sorts of definitions.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:53):**  Really?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:54):**  I didn't see that around the last 12 months or so, but yeah.  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:58):**  But it's good to put it out there.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:10:59):**  Very, very clearly, clearly stated.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:02):**  Affordable nutrient dense, high quality food.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:04):**  Sorry, I didn't mention and fiber on regenerating soils.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:08):**  And that's our clarity of what we mean by that.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:10):**  So it's about the food.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:12):**  So it's about the farming, regenerative agriculture, but it's also about building a regenerative  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:17):**  food proposition as well.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:18):**  So it's taking that food from that what's grown in the field or reared in the field  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:24):**  and can processing it and then selling it right the way through to the end consumer.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:29):**  And for us, that's important because if you want to disrupt the system, you need to tackle  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:33):**  the production end and if you like the consumption end of the equation.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:37):**  So we're focusing on both.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:38):**  And then the third piece in the puzzle for us is doing it within an enterprise framework  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:42):**  that's regenerative by design.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:44):**  And that means things like you distribute the profits more fairly upfront, you hardwire  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:50):**  the purpose of the organization upfront, and you make sure that the assets can never be  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:11:55):**  sold in the short term because somebody sees a casino moment in the marketplace.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:00):**  There's those three elements that come together.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:03):**  And what will that mean concretely, let's say in the UK countryside, what are you planning  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:09):**  to buy to build?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:10):**  And then we'll unpack obviously the forwards further.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:13):**  We're on a five stage journey.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:15):**  Stage one was two years of research and development.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:17):**  Stage two is to acquire a thousand acres of farmland as a first regenerative platform,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:25):**  form it, build out the field to fork capabilities in terms of processing, farm retail, and the  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:32):**  digital platforms and brands that go with it, and put in place all the infrastructure  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:36):**  then to grow to scale.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:39):**  Phase three is to move to 10,000 acres within the same region.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:43):**  And phase four is to grow to roughly 60,000 acres in footprint across the UK.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:48):**  And I'm talking about acquiring land and transitioning it.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:51):**  And then phase five is international expansion beyond that.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:54):**  These phases are not, what's the word, sequential.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:12:56):**  They may overlap, but it's a five phase journey to build a scaled regenerative enterprise.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:03):**  Within a decade, we would anticipate that we'll have 60,000 acres of our own farmland.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:09):**  Who knows how big the supply chain that we can enable will be, a quantum above that.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:15):**  And we will have a home for well over half a billion pounds sterling, which is about  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:21):**  20 euros these days in capital, which can be deployed.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:25):**  So basically the first phase is to acquire this 1000, I want to emphasize the size and  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:29):**  the scale of this acres in the UK.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:32):**  And why so big?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:34):**  Because that's larger than a lot of other things people will have heard or have seen.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:39):**  And it's not a normal, let's say between brackets play of buying the land, regenerating it and  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:43):**  selling it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:44):**  Then we've seen many funds going to that scale and way beyond.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:48):**  But this is a very different one and still you're going for a large, large scale.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:53):**  So why the 1000 acres?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:54):**  What's the reason behind that?  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:13:56):**  Before I answer the why 1000 acres, what I also make clear is that we're building an  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:00):**  operating enterprise.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:01):**  So on that fourth word enterprise, the assumption often, because there's so much of it going  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:06):**  on is this is about an investment vehicle that does a deal with land and put somebody  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:10):**  on to run it.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:12):**  This is about building an operating business.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:14):**  And not selling the land.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:15):**  And not selling the land.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:17):**  Basically we're structuring the company so the land can't be sold in perpetuity.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:21):**  Very important to mention that.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:23):**  It was going to be another question.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:24):**  So no casino, no flipping land.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:26):**  This is buying and holding eventually 60,000 acres in the UK.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:31):**  Just to be clear, it's not 60,000 because that's a magic number.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:34):**  And what it is is you've then got six, 10,000 acre footprints in geographical regions, which  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:41):**  pretty much allows you to cover the whole country.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:44):**  And the logic of that is all about.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:46):**  Hubs.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:48):**  For two reasons.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:49):**  Hubs because you can then, from a business point of view, you can then channel scale  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:53):**  through partnerships.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:54):**  But also hubs because if you're in every part of the country, other farmers can literally  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:14:59):**  come and look over the fence and see what you're doing.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:01):**  And hopefully we can make a contribution by providing a platform that people can learn  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:06):**  from too.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:07):**  You did ask me another question and I've now forgotten what it was.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:10):**  Now I'm wondering, so this 1000 acres, why 1000?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:15):**  And then of course I would love to like paint as a picture what's going to walk on that.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:19):**  What's going to be planted or that how it's going to look different from when you buy  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:22):**  it.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:23):**  And also maybe for people that are not in the UK, how does land like that doesn't have  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:26):**  to be the specific pieces you're buying, but how does it currently look and where does  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:30):**  it go?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:31):**  So first of all, why so big?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:32):**  That's I think the first question.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:34):**  And then let's walk us in a visual way through how that land is going to evolve over the  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:39):**  next decade.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:40):**  There's a famous story about the U2 rockstar Bono when he first went to talk to the general  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:45):**  assembly of the United Nations.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:47):**  And he said, I'm feeling really nervous.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:49):**  He said, I'm feeling really nervous.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:51):**  And everybody was sort of thinking it's because he's talking to the general assembly of the  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:54):**  UN.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:55):**  And he said, I've never spoken in front of such a small audience.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:15:59):**  The size really depends, you know, what is big.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:02):**  It depends where you're looking at it from.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:04):**  From a conventional European perspective, if you look at the long history of agriculture,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:09):**  we have relatively small agricultural operations.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:13):**  So a thousand acres seems like a lot.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:15):**  If you were sitting in the US or Australia, it's not even the, you know, it's not even  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:19):**  the veggie patch behind the farmer's house.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:22):**  It's a very big market garden, but yeah, I know we get the point.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:26):**  But there are a couple of reasons that it matters.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:28):**  The first one is that in this next phase, our primary aim is to demonstrate what's possible  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:36):**  sufficiently that we can handle almost every different context that we will then subsequently  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:42):**  expand to.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:43):**  That's one reason.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:44):**  The second reason is that we are really clear that our role in this transformation is about  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:51):**  demonstrating how scaled agriculture can change.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:16:55):**  And we fully honor and acknowledge and recognize the role of smaller farms and small holders  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:01):**  in regenerative approaches.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:03):**  So we think our contribution can be to sort of break the logjam of, call it, you know,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:08):**  big agri and offer a sort of visible and genuine alternative in that space.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:15):**  And then the third very practical reason is that we're raising 20 million pounds at the  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:19):**  moment.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:20):**  And with that capital, we need to bring the initial platform through to full profitability,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:27):**  including carrying the cost of all the core capabilities and people that we need for then  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:32):**  scaling the operation.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:34):**  And if you're too small, trying to do that on a couple hundred acres, it just doesn't  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:38):**  make sense.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:39):**  Because if you talk about accounting terms, the overheads the farm would have to carry  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:43):**  make it nonsensical.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:44):**  So thousand acres you're talking about as a regenerative enterprise, something that  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:49):**  turns over close to 10 million pounds, makes 2 million pounds of profit a year, even carrying  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:53):**  all the operating costs.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:17:55):**  That's a viable basis on which you can then go on to create more subsequent scale.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:00):**  Basically saying you need a certain scale to do a lot of the farm to fork, obviously  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:04):**  in-house and not having to sell into commodity markets, et cetera.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:07):**  I have a lot of overhead that only makes sense if you get just like, I mean, the magic number  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:12):**  you always hear when somebody is raising a venture fund, like you need 50 million to  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:16):**  have a proper management fee and thus pay for the costs and anything under that is very,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:20):**  very difficult.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:21):**  I know some people disagree and start emailing me, but there is a certain minimum level you  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:26):**  need to go over and in your calculations and in your approach, that is about a thousand  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:31):**  acres and around 20 million to get going.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:33):**  I'm just laughing at your comment about venture funds because part of my life I spent 20 years  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:37):**  heading up investor relations and big sort of listed companies.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:41):**  The great joke is every fund you ever visit when you're talking about your business, they've  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:45):**  always got the top floor of the smartest building.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:49):**  The overhead cost also includes the kind of status that's necessary to be taken seriously  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:54):**  sometimes.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:55):**  It's like an elevator ride.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:56):**  That's all changed in COVID.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:58):**  It's changing.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:18:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:00):**  But I mean, there is a certain scale to things if you want to do a lot of things and if you  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:03):**  want to do things at a scale in terms of impact, and that's, I think it's going to be very  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:07):**  interesting to follow because a thousand acres in this context in the UK is a lot and you're  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:12):**  planning to do a lot of things on it, not just a monoculture grain or et cetera.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:16):**  So let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:17):**  What's the average acre you're buying?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:21):**  What does it look like currently or you're going to buy when you raise and what kind  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:25):**  of transformation can we imagine if we look a decade ahead?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:28):**  So one of the things that we often start with in these kinds of conversations is making  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:35):**  clear that really good regenerative agriculture is principles based but context specific.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:41):**  And that means that you can talk in general terms, but until you're standing on a particular  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:45):**  piece of land, it's very difficult to be precise.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:48):**  So having given that health warning, I'll then take you through.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:52):**  So it's likely to be a conventional mixed farm, which means it's going to have some  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:19:56):**  crops, it's going to have almost certainly some animals and a fair chunk of grass.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:02):**  And overall, it's probably going to have two or three products going out the door.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:07):**  We're agnostic about whether that happens to be predominantly dairy or beef or even  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:14):**  some significant form of arable, rapeseed, whatever it is.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:17):**  It's going to be located in an axis between, if you know the geography of the UK, between  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:22):**  London and Birmingham and to the left.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:25):**  So it's not the flat wheat lands of the or crop lands of the east of the country.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:32):**  So it's likely to be rolling countryside, it's probably going to have relatively small  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:37):**  fields in it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:39):**  And it will be looked like the kind of picture that most people have of rural England with  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:44):**  these hedges and tiny lanes that you have to reverse down when you meet somebody because  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:50):**  there are only one car wide.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:52):**  What it will look like, and that farm will employ four to six people on a full time basis.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:20:57):**  Typically it will have a farmer and his wife because it will be a he and they will be on  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:03):**  a 65 times out of 100, they will be over the age of 65 statistically and they'll have some  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:11):**  low paid seasonal work.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:13):**  What it will look like five years later is let's work backwards from where I've just  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:18):**  finished and that is that it'll have over 100 employees full time on the farm.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:24):**  Well paid just to be.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:26):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:27):**  We talk about both well paid and meaningful work.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:30):**  They will have, by the way, they'll have a minimum of the way things are designed, a  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:35):**  25% profit share in the whole enterprise, which will be divided equally between the  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:39):**  employees not on the basis of who's paid the most and therefore already gets.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:44):**  And there's a, if I remember correctly, a max of the ratio between the lowest paid worker  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:49):**  and the people at the top if we're going to think in a pyramid, which I hate, but let's.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:56):**  So that's inspired by the work of the common good initiative side of Austria, Christian  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:21:59):**  Felber.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:00):**  When you survey people around the world and you say, what do you think the ratio should  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:04):**  be between the highest and lowest paid in an organization?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:07):**  If they're, if you like conventional, you might call steaming free marketers, they'll  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:13):**  say a hundred or a thousand, you know, you should be able to earn an infinite number  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:16):**  more.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:17):**  And if they're very, very egalitarian, they're saying everyone should be paid the same.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:21):**  But when you ask, change that round and say, if we have to reach a compromise, what could  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:25):**  you all live with?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:27):**  Everybody ends up going to somewhere around 10 or 12.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:30):**  So we've set a maximum of 12 between the highest and lowest paid, which is interesting because  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:35):**  in the UK that is also the difference between the highest paid in the British army, between  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:40):**  the highest paid general and the lowest paid soldier, which is fascinating.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:44):**  That's an interesting, and we learned something.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:47):**  I mean, we are learning a lot of new things, but we learned something very unexpectedly  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:50):**  today.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:51):**  So you asked about what does it look like?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:55):**  There are a hundred people.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:56):**  That's a lot.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:57):**  Yeah, it's a lot.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:58):**  That's buzzing.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:22:59):**  That means people renting places locally, buying houses.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:01):**  That's rural economy.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:02):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:03):**  And that's part of the mission of what we're about is that we know that a fully integrated  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:07):**  regenerative approach will transform rural economies.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:10):**  And that's part of the reason why the food bit is really important because on site, first  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:16):**  of all, the agricultural obviously look completely different because you'll go from probably  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:20):**  three products to, I would say it's 103.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:23):**  I mean, you don't know what the final number will be, but you'll have almost certainly  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:28):**  cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, if you just talk about the animal side of the equation,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:35):**  you're going to have a market garden operation.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:37):**  There will be a whole mix of different arable.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:39):**  There'll be nuts, trees that will have been planted though they're probably not in five  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:43):**  years time.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:44):**  They won't be producing anything.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:45):**  You'll have row cropping.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:46):**  You'll have, there'll be no plowing, all the normal sort of standard principles you'd expect  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:51):**  in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:23:53):**  But then the bulk of that produce will be sold through the enterprise's own retail operations.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:00):**  So what you'll find is there'll be a processing facility.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:04):**  And again, it's situation dependent because it may or may not be that there'll be, for  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:07):**  example, a milking herd on site.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:11):**  And if there is, then there'll be a creamery, there'll be a butchery, there'll be a charcuterie,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:15):**  there'll be a smutmokery.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:16):**  But this really depends on what you end up buying, obviously.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:20):**  Context.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:21):**  And the bulk will be processed and actually sold through the farm shop, restaurant, et  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:26):**  cetera.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:28):**  And that's really important because when we looked across the UK at farm shop, at farm  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:32):**  retail, it's as serious a technical business as any, as the production side.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:39):**  And so to do it effectively, you need to do it properly and you need to do it at a reasonable  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:42):**  scale so that you can present the opportunity for people who come and buy to effectively  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:48):**  buy the bulk of their food purchases if they choose to.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:52):**  Sounds obvious, but...  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:53):**  Yeah, it's booming.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:24:54):**  But if you envision a farm shop, you think very small, a few products here and there,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:00):**  and not very, I wouldn't say sophisticated because it definitely is, but something people  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:03):**  do on the side that might be open a Saturday.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:06):**  But there are actually operations that are way more sophisticated.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:08):**  And in order to do it well, you need to do obviously also that, like it needs to be almost  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:13):**  mimicking a smaller scale supermarket where you can get almost everything obviously as  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:17):**  fresh as possible.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:19):**  And you need to, yeah, it shouldn't be just an extra, it should be your primary place  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:23):**  to buy most of your food or 50, 60, whatever percentage of your calories should come from  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:28):**  there.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:29):**  Then it becomes interesting.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:30):**  And equally, this is the, where we started this conversation was that this is about disrupting  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:34):**  the agri-food system.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:36):**  So if regenerative agriculture provides us with a knowledge base to disrupt the production  
**[0:25:41-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:41):**  side, then the low cost of technological disintermediation, which basically means we can connect production  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:52):**  with the people who eat the food at low cost means that we can build a relationship and  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:25:56):**  a network and a sales platform digitally that allows us to connect with everybody locally  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:01):**  and beyond local as well.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:02):**  So you can do that well, you can do it badly.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:05):**  If you do it well, then it's an effortless, one rapid click experience to fill my shopping  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:11):**  basket and then decide to come and pick it up at the farm or have it delivered, whichever  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:15):**  you prefer.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:16):**  And hopefully you come to the farm and you'll also wander around because you'll also have  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:20):**  an opportunity to learn all about this whole regenerative space and you'll go into the  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:23):**  coffee shop and you'll meet your friends there and you can imagine the picture.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:28):**  That's what it's all about.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:29):**  It's one of the reasons why in our team we have one of our co-founders, Kirsty Sadler  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:35):**  was the marketing director of the Leon Restaurant Group and in the UK, for those who are not  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:40):**  familiar with it, Leon is famous for producing high, for essentially taking the fast food  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:46):**  business model, but then putting high quality food through it, organic and so on.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:51):**  So actually there are big spread out in Europe as well.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:54):**  I've seen them definitely in Amsterdam, et cetera, the airports, but yeah, it's still  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:26:59):**  mostly UK I think.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:01):**  It's a very interesting model, but then you go one step further after that as well.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:05):**  Like it becomes a food brand as well.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:07):**  It's not between brackets again, just the farm shop where you can buy your stuff if  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:11):**  you go there.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:12):**  But actually you mentioned it just now, you can also have it delivered and you can also  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:15):**  have that seamless experience for in case you don't want to drive or you don't want  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:18):**  to get to or you don't live nearby the final spot you end up choosing.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:23):**  And I think that add on is going to be crucial because that seems to be not the case with  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:27):**  many other even well run farm shops.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:29):**  Well, the way we describe it is that none of the individual components of what we're  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:33):**  seeking to do, what we're doing is fundamentally new, but it's putting them all together.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:38):**  That's disruption.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:40):**  So you can run a brilliant farm shop on an individual farm.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:44):**  You can do it in a conventional farm as well and you can buy in the stuff that you don't  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:48):**  grow yourself and that's great.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:50):**  But if you build a national brand around it and engage people around the movement that  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:27:55):**  regenerative food represents, then you supercharge the whole thing.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:00):**  And it also means that when you build out the next site on another farm, people are  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:04):**  already engaged with the brand and they're already excited about it and they're already  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:07):**  interested in it.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:08):**  And in that sense, you're driving change because it's a huge education job for us all to do.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:13):**  Because people don't know it's not the cow, it's the how.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:16):**  They don't know that.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:17):**  If they've seen the movie that almost was called like that, but now called sacred cow,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:22):**  they do.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:23):**  But yeah, that's actually a good question.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:25):**  Because in the plans, obviously it's context specific.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:27):**  There are a lot of animals involved because the topsoil has to be rebuilt and it might  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:31):**  be part of a transition.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:33):**  And there's good margins in it to another extent.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:35):**  But for people that say, yeah, that's a lot of animals, then shouldn't we all be eating  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:39):**  less?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:40):**  Like what's the education journey look like for the average person, I'm not saying consumer,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:44):**  that comes to the food shop, maybe to the restaurant and is maybe expecting less animal  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:51):**  protein on the menu?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:52):**  The first thing I would say is that there is nothing about a regenerative approach that  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:28:58):**  requires animals.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:00):**  What I would say is that with the level of knowledge that we currently have, it's easier  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:05):**  with animals.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:07):**  And that's important because we are all babies in our knowledge base in this space.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:12):**  And what we'll be able to do in 10 years time will be completely different to what we can  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:16):**  do now.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:17):**  So that's the first comment.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:19):**  The second is that the educational journey is about outcomes.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:25):**  So at the moment, if I walk into a shop, I buy, you know, I'm ecologically concerned,  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:31):**  I buy something because it's got an organic label on it.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:35):**  What I don't realise is that if I look at the science behind the ecological effect of  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:41):**  what happens in many organic contexts, the reality is that it's not materially necessarily  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:48):**  any better than a chemical approach.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:50):**  We'd like it to be but, you know, nothing in the science necessarily tells us that it  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:54):**  is.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:29:56):**  So the question, the consumer journey, the goal, the conversation around our consumption  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:01):**  is all about switching people from looking for a label that is about a process to seeking  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:08):**  to understand what's the actual impact of how my food is grown.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:13):**  Is it genuinely regenerating the soils?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:15):**  Is it genuinely providing local livelihoods?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:19):**  Is it all of those really those kind of questions, you know, outcomes, not process?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:24):**  And that's a big education.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:25):**  It's a huge but of course, it's much easier if people come to the farm and see and experience  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:32):**  and walk around instead of buying some anonymous product somewhere with a label on it in a  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:38):**  supermarket where you have maybe three seconds or maybe even less to like if somebody comes,  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:44):**  like you have a lot of interaction moments and touch points where waiters can do certain  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:48):**  things where the chefs can do certain things, the menu can explain the view people have  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:52):**  like, please go for a walk around, please see holistic management, how it works in practice,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:56):**  please see the market gardens and the raised beds, why they are so different than no-till,  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:30:59):**  etc.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:00):**  Why?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:01):**  I mean, there's, you have a lot of people coming to the side, which gives you a lot  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:04):**  more opportunity to go on that journey if they want to, if they choose not to.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:08):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:09):**  And it may be that they only do that once because they're passing through.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:13):**  But it'll change their lives.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:14):**  And in changing their lives, they'll start driving different questions to the places  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:18):**  that they normally shop.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:20):**  And maybe that they do it once, but then most of the time they order online.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:23):**  That's also fine.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:25):**  You've opened up awareness and you covered some of the things.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:27):**  But if you think about regenerative by design, and you say farm is a place that's not closed  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:33):**  and unwelcoming, it's open and welcoming, then you start thinking about things like,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:38):**  okay, let's lay out the land so that you can handle large numbers of people coming through  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:43):**  and walking around and learning what's going on.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:46):**  And you can create visual interpretation and you can create walkways that you wouldn't  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:50):**  otherwise do.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:51):**  And simple things like making sure you build enough parking.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:53):**  I mean, very dull, but that is actually often.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:56):**  Often goes wrong.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:57):**  Yeah, often goes wrong.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:31:58):**  It becomes in a mud bath somewhere that people didn't think about.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:01):**  Too small, whatever.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:03):**  And you mentioned something before, like we hope that neighbors and other farms look over  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:06):**  the fence.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:07):**  I'm imagining the fences are going to be very low, or at least you can look through them.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:11):**  But what's it from preventing being, these are the outsiders coming in, just like as  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:15):**  a lamb back in the days in Australia, the stupid land management, these are the weirdos  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:19):**  doing things very different.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:21):**  How are you going to make sure you are regenerative by design also apart from hiring a lot of  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:25):**  people locally, obviously, which would be interesting, but being embedded in a place  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:30):**  that you didn't grow up in and don't have 200 years of roots and making sure that you're  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:36):**  first of all being accepted for a certain time before you show things, and then how  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:41):**  do you get more farmers, the neighbors, etc. to take down the fence and actually join you  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:45):**  on that journey?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:46):**  Well, there's several answers to that question, but the context in the UK is one that has  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:52):**  changed quite dramatically in a short period of time.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:54):**  So if you'd have asked me that question five years ago, I'd have said it's really difficult  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:32:59):**  because people are very closed.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:01):**  They're not open to new ideas.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:03):**  They're not interested in change.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:05):**  Like your wife said when you suggested Brussels, basically.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:08):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:09):**  But that's changed dramatically.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:10):**  And for some people, it's changed in a positive way because it's about the kind of acknowledgement  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:15):**  that the way we farm now is an ecological challenge.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:19):**  For other people, it's negative.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:20):**  It's because I can't make any money.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:22):**  And now the subsidies are going, what the hell am I going to do?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:25):**  So funnily enough, that's from the point of view of what we're doing.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:29):**  We're not anticipating this is a major issue.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:31):**  Equally though, we're also really clear that the philosophy of any good regenerative enterprises,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:37):**  you're deeply embedded in the communities in which you operate.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:39):**  And that's not just surrounding farmers.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:42):**  It's also the villages and towns which are near.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:45):**  So there's some very routine things that you can do to address that.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:50):**  Everybody should do anyway.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:52):**  Which is essentially you open up lines of communication with everybody.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:55):**  You talk to them about what you're doing.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:56):**  You make it visible.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:57):**  You share it.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:58):**  You discuss it.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:33:59):**  And the philosophy is not one of arrogance that we know something other people don't,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:04):**  but one of humility that says, we've all got the same challenge and we're on a journey  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:10):**  to try and do something better.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:12):**  And we'd love to learn from everybody around us.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:14):**  If we can contribute something, that's great.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:17):**  But you have to do it from a perspective of the regeneration of the land is a journey,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:22):**  not a destination.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:24):**  And that's, I think a lot of the history of agroecological land management practices has  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:32):**  been about saying the other way is wrong.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:35):**  I'm right.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:36):**  I'm morally superior.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:38):**  I've seen some examples of that.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:40):**  It usually doesn't end well.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:41):**  No, it doesn't.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:42):**  But it is the basis that puts people in conflict.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:45):**  And we're saying actually regeneration is the direction of travel.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:48):**  And if every year everybody does something that's a little bit better than last year,  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:52):**  in a decade from now, it all looks very different.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:54):**  So it's not about critiquing someone because they're not regenerative.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:34:59):**  It's more about saying, how can we all move the dial?  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:03):**  And what are the things that we can learn from each other in doing that?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:05):**  So what do you envision?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:07):**  Let's say I'm a neighbor farmer.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:08):**  I'm looking over the fence.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:09):**  The first few years I'm a bit suspicious, but I'm also interested because I see things  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:13):**  changing.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:14):**  How could I get involved in the process of new foundation farms?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:18):**  So if you're a neighboring farmer, there are two main possibilities.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:22):**  The first one is that we will have an educational platform on site.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:26):**  So we're in the business of education as well.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:29):**  In that respect, we partnered with 3LM, who are the savory hub for the UK.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:35):**  And what we will enable is a physical site that demonstrates a lot of the practices of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:39):**  holistic management, both day to day and over time.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:44):**  And secondly, we'll say, if you start the regenerative journey, then we can provide  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:49):**  an access point for the products that you're growing.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:52):**  Which is not banal.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:54):**  That's a big thing for many.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:35:56):**  Like where can I sell if I start chicken caravan or start rotations or et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:03):**  And we will have that retail pipeline that means that you will have a market.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:08):**  And the good news is that because we're disintermediating all the other players in the supply chain,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:14):**  our expectation is that we will be able to pay a decent premium for the products that  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:17):**  you're able to grow for.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:19):**  So I'm looking, you can't see, but I'm looking out because I'm surrounded by fields of a  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:24):**  company called Riverford.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:25):**  And I don't know if you're familiar with it.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:28):**  Riverford is jointly with a company called Abel and Cole, the two big gorillas in the  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:33):**  vegetable box landscape and the meat box landscape in the UK delivering to people's homes.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:40):**  I don't know what the latest statistic is on Riverford, but the last count, it must  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:44):**  be somewhere around 100,000 boxes a week of food going out.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:48):**  It's again, I'm not accurate on the figures, but it's my eldest son is currently working  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:52):**  there in his gap year because in COVID he can't travel anywhere.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:56):**  And let's say COVID has not hurt their business.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:36:58):**  No, it hasn't, but they employ at least 500 people and they are a focal point for supply  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:03):**  for farmers right over this region.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:06):**  The result is there's barely a farm that isn't nearby that isn't supplying Riverford.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:11):**  And one of the things that Riverford has done consistently is say to its supply chain of  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:16):**  farmers and they call them cooperative partners.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:18):**  We will guarantee offtake because we know that our customers will buy and we'll guarantee  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:22):**  the price.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:23):**  So you grow it and we can sell it.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:26):**  And just imagine how enabling that is compared with living in a context where you're growing  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:31):**  your produce, you're hoping that there isn't going to be a glut of it or even if it does  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:36):**  grow and the price is going to be reasonable.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:40):**  Riverford just fixed the prices a year in advance and everybody's happy and they guarantee  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:44):**  the offtake.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:45):**  They take more than the farmers grow.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:48):**  And that's a model that should really be working everywhere.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:50):**  There's no reason why it can't.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:53):**  Let's switch gears a bit to the finance side of things.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:56):**  So I've always a few questions I love to ask.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:37:58):**  Let's see if we can get through them with the time.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:00):**  But I want to take one step back because you mentioned holistic management and 3LM, which  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:05):**  I will definitely link below.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:06):**  This is a very big question, actually a rabbit hole.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:09):**  What does holistic management mean to you and why did you choose this as an operating  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:12):**  or as a management system for the regenerative enterprise?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:15):**  I spent five years running a global coalition of companies and business schools to transform  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:20):**  business education.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:21):**  It was called the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:24):**  One of the things that I realized is that it is the frameworks within which you make  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:29):**  decisions that determine the potential number of outcomes you can produce.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:35):**  And conventional business management is really bad at optimizing economic outcomes and ecological  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:41):**  ones simultaneously.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:43):**  It doesn't have a framework to do that.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:45):**  It thinks of these things as trade-offs.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:47):**  And whereas for us, holistic management is the best tool we have found that allows you  
**[0:38:53-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:38:53):**  to integrate questions about land use, about profitability, about social impact, and answer  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:02):**  them in a way that gives you an action plan that you can work with.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:06):**  So a lot of people are very focused on the use of animals for rehabilitation of land  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:11):**  in when they think about holistic management and savory.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:14):**  For me, that is important but very secondary compared with the genius of a management framework  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:21):**  that allows you to think about and resolve multiple challenges simultaneously.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:26):**  I would also say that it's coupled with the principles of the Ecological Health Index  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:33):**  or its commercial framework, ecological outcome verification, as an outcomes-based measurement  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:39):**  system.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:41):**  So you're using holistic management to think through the issues you're wrestling with.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:46):**  You're using ecological outcome verification to see whether you're winning or losing from  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:52):**  an ecological perspective.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:54):**  And putting that together, you've got a system that is as sophisticated on the ecological  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:39:58):**  side as conventional accounting is on the financial side.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:02):**  And our view is without that, it's trial and error as to whether or not you're going to  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:07):**  succeed to run an effective regenerative enterprise that makes money and has a positive ecological  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:14):**  result.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:15):**  You need that management system.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:16):**  And you'll be tracking on the Ecological Health Index basically very specific things over  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:21):**  time over the next decades.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:24):**  Are you hitting your goals and your outcomes you're looking for that you through the management  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:28):**  system have identified and which dials you have been turning, etc.?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:32):**  Yes, and the Ecological Health Index goes between minus 140 and plus 120.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:37):**  And zero is the transition from degenerative to regenerative.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:41):**  And we know that almost any farm that you walk onto in the UK that's either conventionally  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:45):**  organically run is going to be somewhere between minus 10 and minus 30.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:49):**  And we also know that within four years, you can bring that to somewhere between plus 30  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:54):**  and plus 60.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:55):**  And as you do that, you also start getting the economic.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:40:59):**  So the economics is also connected because when you've got that healthily functioning  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:02):**  ecological system, you've got the platform on which you can drive the profitability as  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:07):**  well.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:08):**  So these things, you're not doing it purely because you like to know that you're making  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:12):**  ecological progress.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:13):**  You're also doing it because it delivers the economic results you're looking for.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:16):**  It unlocks a lot more things.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:18):**  So let's say tomorrow morning, you're no longer the executive chair of New Foundation Farms,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:23):**  but you're running a $1 billion investment fund.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:26):**  I'm asking this question always because I love to ask questions, bigger numbers, because  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:30):**  there's just a lot of money flowing into the space, wanting to flow into the space.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:34):**  And I'm imagining the next year is trying to flow into this space.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:37):**  So we need to get used to larger amounts.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:40):**  And I'm asking specifically, like, what would you prioritize?  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:43):**  Not down to the dollar, obviously, like I would put X, Y, Z, but what would be the first  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:47):**  few things you would really focus most of your attention if you have basically unlimited  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:51):**  resources to a certain extent?  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:53):**  What would that be with a billion dollars?  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:41:55):**  I'm going to avoid giving you two answers, even though I'm desperate to do that.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:00):**  You can invest in multiple things, obviously, you can say I would invest half of it in X  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:04):**  and 25% in Y, etc.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:07):**  So if I was a financial return based investor, I'd create a special purpose field and I'd  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:12):**  go and buy a shedload of conventional farmland.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:16):**  And then I'd be talking to people I've asked to do deals to transition it.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:20):**  That's what I would do.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:21):**  And the reason I would spend the money doing that is because I would want to see scaled  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:27):**  demonstration of what's possible in as many places as possible in order for other people  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:32):**  then to also replicate it.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:34):**  And I know because we run the numbers, that the economics of that would be very attractive.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:40):**  And part of the reason why we're doing this in the UK, people say, but you know, agricultural  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:44):**  land is in the UK, why don't you, you know, we know of investment funds that have looked  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:49):**  at a regenerative approach and said, well, we can't, we can make more money by doing  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:53):**  it in the US or Australia.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:42:55):**  And we said, well, that's fine, but we're comfortable that we can make a very good return  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:00):**  out of doing it here in this integrated way.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:03):**  And if we can prove it's possible here, when you're paying 10 to 12,000 pounds an acre,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:07):**  then you can do it anywhere.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:08):**  You would go to expensive places just to show it's possible.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:11):**  Well, I probably also I'd spread my risk, you know, if I'm a portfolio manager, but  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:16):**  I would be shopping in the UK and a mainland Europe for farmland and then looking for people  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:21):**  to help me transition that.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:23):**  And what if you would be, let's say, mostly impact focus, impact outcome focus.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:29):**  So you would love the money at some point has to flow back, but you don't need, you  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:33):**  don't have a return target.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:34):**  Some return would be great, but it's not a grant, but it's let's say impact first as  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:38):**  an investment portfolio.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:39):**  What would you do?  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:40):**  It's very boring, but I do the same thing.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:42):**  And I'll tell you why, because my theory of change is that the way change happens is you  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:48):**  create examples of the new.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:51):**  So there's a model of change called the Berkana model of change of how societies change.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:56):**  And it was created by a thing called the Berkana Institute.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:43:59):**  And I'm going to spell it wrong, but it's B-E-R-K-H-A-N-A.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:04):**  I'll put it into show notes for anybody interested.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:08):**  So essentially what it says is that you get outliers who do something, they all think  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:12):**  they're doing something unique, but actually there are several of them.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:15):**  They then start talking in small groups to each other and then they realize they're part  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:18):**  of a bigger movement and then they all start joining up and they create a common narrative.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:23):**  This is true in all societal change throughout history.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:25):**  There's nothing fundamental.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:26):**  It seems that we're getting there, like we're in that talking to each other.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:31):**  That's where we are now.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:32):**  We're on the edge of this third phase.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:34):**  So stage one, you do it on your own.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:36):**  Stage two, you connect with others.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:38):**  Stage three, you start creating a common narrative.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:40):**  And start fighting about regenerative washing and it's being watered down, diluted, et  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:45):**  cetera.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:46):**  Yeah, that's where we're at now.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:48):**  But stage four is you start seeing proof of application emerges in multiple places at  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:52):**  a sufficient scale that people say, hmm, this could be the future.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:56):**  So mentally they've switched from this is innovation, but we don't know if it is the  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:44:59):**  future to now this is the future, but it's small scale.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:03):**  And then stage five is when it replaces the old.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:06):**  But at the heart of that is people demonstrating this new future.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:12):**  And the more people that are demonstrating this new future, the better.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:15):**  So I wouldn't be, for example, spending my impact money necessarily on creating networks  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:20):**  of farmers who you're trying to persuade to change.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:24):**  I'd be backing those who are changing and providing the capital for them to get on and  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:28):**  do it.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:29):**  And then the more sites you have demonstrating and learning, the faster you create the change.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:35):**  And what if you could change you have a magic wand and you can change one thing overnight  
**[0:45:40-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:40):**  in food and egg, let's say even in climate.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:42):**  But I'm imagining you're going to say something in food and egg.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:45):**  What would be the one thing you would could be global consciousness?  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:47):**  It could be banning GMOs or banning animals to be inside.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:51):**  I mean, it could be anything.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:53):**  What would you change?  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:45:54):**  I would put in every human beings mind and heart and soul the question.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:02):**  I want to know what the ecological impact is of the food that I'm eating.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:07):**  I want to know whether this food is actually coming from a place that is improving or destroying  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:14):**  nature because that would transform everything overnight because suddenly the demand would  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:20):**  be there.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:21):**  The producers would change because we wouldn't be able to keep up with the volume of demand  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:26):**  and it would drive innovation.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:28):**  That's what I would do.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:29):**  I would put that one question.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:30):**  Is the food I am growing, is it building soil or not?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:34):**  Grown on regenerating soils.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:36):**  Great question.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:38):**  Is the food I'm eating grown on regenerating soils?  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:40):**  Yes or no?  
**[0:46:41-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:41):**  I like the version of is it destroying nature or not?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:43):**  Because I think it's beyond the field as well.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:46):**  And you make the point about it's beyond the field.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:49):**  That's really important.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:50):**  So if you have a look at the New Foundation Farms website, we deliberately building or  
**[0:46:55-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:55):**  started the process of building a consumer brand.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:46:57):**  So everything that we're starting to do and talk about is targeted at changing the consumer  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:03):**  conversation.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:04):**  So we published a manifesto there.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:05):**  It's not our manifesto.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:06):**  It's the manifesto for a radically natural future for farming.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:11):**  Why?  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:12):**  Because we want to talk to the next generation and tune in to what they're looking for by  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:17):**  starting to help them understand what the answer is to the question, how do I eat in  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:21):**  a way that's more healthy and more aligned with creating a better world and a better  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:25):**  earth.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:26):**  And to end with, I mean, there's always dangers because I usually have follow up questions,  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:30):**  but a question inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:32):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:37):**  true?  
**[0:47:38-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:38):**  What I believe is that every single facet of the agri-food system can become regenerative.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:47):**  It can be super profitable and it can restore nature.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:53):**  And there is no excuse for us not doing that everywhere in every part of agriculture.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:47:58):**  Yeah, I don't think I should ask a follow up question after that.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:01):**  That's just the perfect ending of this conversation.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:03):**  Thank you so much, Mark.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:04):**  You'll be back a number of times on the show and we'll be unpacking all the different facets  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:09):**  actually of new foundation farms with a number of your co-founders over the next weeks and

**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:14):**  I'm very much looking forward to that, but I think it was a great kickoff of this journey  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:48:18):**  and I'm very much looking forward to keep following that and see how it unfolds.

**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:50:02):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:50:03):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:50:08):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:50:13):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:12):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:14):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:19):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:24):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:29):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:33):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:34):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:40):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:42):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:51:47-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:47):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:53):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:57):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:51:59):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:04):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:08):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:13):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:14):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:16):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:18):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:22):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:24):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-drewell#t=0:52:29):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

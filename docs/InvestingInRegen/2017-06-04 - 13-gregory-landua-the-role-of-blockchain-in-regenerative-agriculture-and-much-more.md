**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Gregory Landau, CEO of Terra Genesis International.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:19):**  We're going to talk about of course the opportunity impact investors have to get active in the  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:24):**  regenerative agriculture space.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:26):**  But most importantly in this interview we're going to discuss the role of blockchain, what  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:30):**  can smart contracts and a distributed ledger do for the regenerative agriculture space.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:36):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:43):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:44):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:48):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:54):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:07):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:12):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:17):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:21):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:24):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:28):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:33):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:37):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:54):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:57):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:01:58):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:02):**  I'm Koen van Zeeijen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:04):**  In the podcast of today we have Gregory Lambdaou, CEO of Terra Genesis International, a regenerative  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:09):**  design consultancy based in Idaho.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Gregory.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:13):**  Thanks for having me on the show.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:14):**  Thank you for coming.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:15):**  And to start with a personal question, what's your journey into regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:20):**  and why did you end up here?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:22):**  Well that's a great question.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:23):**  I think I went to school as an undergrad student in environmental science and at that point  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:33):**  and I think still that discipline is pretty focused on explanations of the problems of  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:39):**  sort of the planetary crisis of species extinction and global warming and environmental toxic  
**[0:02:45-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:45):**  ecology and at that point there was a lot of talk about the impact of aerosols and the  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:53):**  stratosphere and ozone depletion and other things.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:02:56):**  And I really, honestly I really just got tired of all of the doom and gloom and started sort  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:02):**  of my own exploration of what kind of solutions exist out there and how can humans through  
**[0:03:10-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:10):**  our economic activities be a force for health and balance on a global scale and in our home  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:21):**  ecosystems.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:23):**  And that search led me to encounter permaculture when I was quite young and start engaging  
**[0:03:32-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:32):**  with the art and science of designing human systems that increase ecosystem health while  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:40):**  meeting human needs instead of extracting value from ecosystems in order to meet human  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:47):**  wants is how I would sort of juxtapose the search that I was engaged in with sort of  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:52):**  business as usual.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:03:54):**  So from there it's just been a deepening exploration of how that search for how to meet human needs  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:03):**  and increase ecosystem health can appear and where the most strategic intervention points  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:10):**  are in the system to help the economy start to shift towards one that is really celebrating  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:18):**  and honoring all life in the way that the economy functions.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:22):**  And when you look at these entry points or where the most possible impact could be made  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:28):**  at the beginning you identified supply chains and you identified companies in that supply  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:34):**  chain.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:35):**  Can you explain why that is and what you actually do in those supply chains?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:40):**  Well so one thing to recognize is at Terragenesis we very rarely use the word the concept supply  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:49):**  chain actually.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:50):**  And there's a whole history of how that term came to be used in business.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:04:56):**  But the short version is that term basically represents an extractive mindset.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:02):**  A linear system.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:04):**  To yank and extract value in a linear way out of from sort of a pool of value and put  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:10):**  it in a place where it is of relatively more value.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:15):**  And so we sort of think of the value adding stream.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:20):**  So there's a stream where a so we speak about value adding streams and the potential of  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:28):**  engaging either at different points in that value adding stream or with the stream as  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:32):**  a whole with businesses is really enormously potent.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:39):**  So my passion and my quest early on was and still is in a way to transform as much of  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:46):**  the agricultural landscape to towards a landscape that can draw down carbon from the atmosphere  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:55):**  and uplift the farmers and communities that are the stewards of that landscape at the  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:05:59):**  same time.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:01):**  And so in order to do that we really need to be working systemically connecting to the  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:07):**  businesses that are purchasing ingredients and adding value to those ingredients before  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:12):**  they come to the end customer.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:15):**  And so really in order to change on a large scale land use especially agricultural land  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:23):**  use we need to be working with the businesses that are making the big purchases and that  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:29):**  are complexifying and adding value to that which they're purchasing.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:34):**  The ingredients that come from you know the Amazon rainforest or for the soy fields of  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:43):**  middle America wherever it might be.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:45):**  So as an entry point that's the leverage point you're using in this stream basically.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:51):**  And what do you do with these companies when I mean you have many examples obviously when  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:06:56):**  a company comes to you and say OK we want to stop looking at our supply chain as a chain  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:00):**  but as a circle or as a stream.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:03):**  Where do you start.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:05):**  So there's there's sort of a change from you know I oftentimes describe it from sustainable  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:11):**  supply chain is sort of a concept and people have a fixed idea of what that means.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:16):**  And then you know so oftentimes companies come to us with this sort of sustainable supply  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:21):**  chain business paradigm where they're looking to optimize for certain key metrics or indicators.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:29):**  And we're sort of taking them on a journey that leads them to the next step which is  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:33):**  what we would call the regenerative producer web which is in a producer web you're starting  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:39):**  to recognize what you just spoke to in your question which is oh this isn't a linear chain.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:44):**  And actually everyone in the network of value adding is adding value.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:52):**  There isn't sort of this strictly linear relationship.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:56):**  There's a more complex relationship.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:07:57):**  And in that so so working with companies to help them with their mindset shift from sort  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:03):**  of a linear we're extracting X value to OK there is a there's a web of reciprocity here  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:11):**  and we're playing a key role.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:13):**  How do we understand the role that the other members of this web are playing and grow their  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:19):**  capacity to do that better while we're growing our capacity to produce a better product for  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:25):**  our customers.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:26):**  So the way that that looks in a very tangible way is we engage with analysis and assessment  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:35):**  of the system of supply risk assessments opportunity assessments.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:41):**  We engage with the company to sort of invite them to be able to see an image of what the  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:50):**  ecosystem that they're purchasing ingredients out of could look like at its optimal health.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:08:57):**  And in order to do that with a business person it's sort of like a crash course in ecology  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:03):**  and oftentimes even sociology understanding the cultural dynamics.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:08):**  So we're really inviting our clients into a much deeper understanding of the places  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:14):**  that they're interacting with and making purchases from so that they can become a partner to  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:20):**  that location in generating healthier results for both the ecosystem and the clients of  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:27):**  the company.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:28):**  And I can imagine that's a process that takes much longer than the average client purchaser  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:35):**  agreement etc.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:37):**  What's the role of time in this in this space.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:39):**  Yeah we generally like you know of course it's important to sort of have a period of  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:45):**  courtship so that they so that we can all build trust in one another.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:50):**  So we usually engage with a discrete bit of work to do the assessment process and a few  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:09:57):**  key bits of education where no matter what happens they can have kind of a strategic  
**[0:10:02-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:02):**  roadmap moving forward that's highly valuable really rooted in the ecological social realities  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:12):**  of the places that purchases are being made.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:14):**  So there's a discrete engagement and that usually lasts you know somewhere around six  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:19):**  to eight months where there's assessment and education happening.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:23):**  But generally we're looking at sort of a three to five year timeframe because the goal here  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:29):**  is to grow the company's capacity to be thinking and acting regeneratively so that there the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:37):**  effect that they have on the systems that they're interacting with is to actually grow  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:42):**  the capacity of that system itself to evolve in response to climate change in response  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:48):**  to innovation whatever the dynamic needs are.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:53):**  And what that does is it creates a really robust and resilient relationship between  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:10:58):**  the company and the place where they're both growing capacity.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:01):**  So that also invites the customers of the company in an extraordinarily exciting journey.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:07):**  So there's sort of a lot of ways to see the value proposition of our work but as you were  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:14):**  noting it isn't a short term solution.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:17):**  In order to start to learn to engage with complexity and do so in a way that has regenerative  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:24):**  results it's a journey and it's building new business habits it's building new capacity  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:30):**  and really it's being able to see problems with new eyes so that the solutions that are  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:35):**  inherent with those problems can actually be identified and nurtured.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:39):**  And maybe that's actually one of the barriers.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:42):**  What are the barriers you see after being working in the sector for a while?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:46):**  What are the barriers to the regenerative agriculture sector to scale up?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:50):**  Maybe not scale up as we're used to in the software world but to reach more of those  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:55):**  hectares and many more of those farms and land stewards.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:11:58):**  What are those barriers that are currently holding the sector down and not making it  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:04):**  reach its full potential?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:06):**  Yeah well that's a great question and I think points to some of in fact points to some of  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:12):**  the solutions that software may actually offer.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:16):**  So for an ecological system to be healthy it needs to have biodiversity and your listeners  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:24):**  who are somewhat familiar with ecology or keep up with environmental news oftentimes  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:30):**  will have heard you know we're losing biodiversity at a rapid rate.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:35):**  Well that's not just in the wild lands of the world that's also in agricultural systems.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:41):**  So the enormous richness of heirloom crops has been diminishing as companies optimize  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:50):**  for yield and usually chemically fed yield.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:55):**  You know over 50 years or so of the Green Revolution there's sort of been this bottleneck  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:12:59):**  where the diversity the agricultural diversity of the world has collapsed.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:06):**  And that's because of the single big problem which I'm going to sort of speak about that's  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:12):**  limiting the spread of regenerative agriculture which is sort of the logistics of bringing  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:19):**  diversity to the marketplace.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:21):**  So we have a global marketplace that's built very efficiently to bring single crops from  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:30):**  large scale farms to into the commodities market and then from there spread it amongst  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:36):**  the diversity of businesses that then add value to the crop and create food or cosmetics  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:44):**  or medicines whatever it might be.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:46):**  We've basically forced ecology to match our abstract logistics and economic system.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:13:55):**  Instead we need to redesign the logistics and systems of exchange to match a healthy  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:03):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:05):**  And what that means is the potential here with this problem I think is in software that  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:13):**  allows distributed purchases into diverse agroecosystems.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:18):**  So if a farmer no longer has to optimize for a single crop in order to just sort of sell  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:26):**  bulk and have very low margins but instead could sell you know five or even ten different  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:34):**  crops off of the same piece of land and have those crops efficiently distributed to all  
**[0:14:40-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:40):**  of the different buyers in a way that that system of supply can aggregate at the appropriate  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:49):**  scales and then distribute at the appropriate scales.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:14:52):**  We would basically have a system of supply that can meet a healthy ecosystem where it's  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:00):**  at and in fact increase the health of the ecosystem and the farmer while engendering  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:08):**  a very vibrant economy.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:10):**  And is that the angle because I read some articles before the angle of where blockchain  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:16):**  and the distributed technologies or software we're seeing the birth of now come in and  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:22):**  could play their potentially vital role?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:25):**  That is my opinion 100%.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:27):**  In fact we're devoting substantial resources at this point to the development of agricultural  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:36):**  specific applications of blockchain technology because the potential to have a verification  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:42):**  system of the increase of ecosystem health right through key indicators like carbon the  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:49):**  drawdown of atmospheric carbon into soil and above ground biomass biodiversity.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:15:55):**  These are all things that we know how to monitor and can be embedded into a smart contract  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:01):**  and in a distributed ledger system.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:04):**  So when you combine that sort of layer with the ability for blockchain to track provenance  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:12):**  and create transparency through a value adding stream you have this enormously powerful tool  
**[0:16:19-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:19):**  for disrupting and transforming the way the entire global system of supply works and regenerate  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:27):**  that system of supply in a way that is in service to the health of the ecosystem.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:31):**  Now I don't know I know that there's a lot of buzz and there's a lot of excitement about  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:36):**  the blockchain both in investment circles as well as in development circles and even  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:42):**  in agricultural circles to a certain degree but I don't really know of very many other  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:47):**  projects that are really asking what's the highest use of the blockchain as a tool for  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:54):**  regenerating agro ecosystems in service to the health of the planet.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:16:58):**  And that's really the next big thing for Terogenesis International and what we're devoting our  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:04):**  coming year to in partnership with some of our existing clients and a growing pool of  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:11):**  investors who are interested in sort of pioneering that disruption.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:16):**  And if you can tell of course where would be the first application of this technology  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:22):**  in your eyes.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:23):**  Like if we speak in a year from now I mean you're devoting your time now to that and  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:28):**  your resources and focusing on that and if we talk in a year from now what would we be  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:33):**  discussing now in terms of blockchain and regenerative agriculture in an ideal scenario?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:39):**  Well I think in an ideal scenario we will have a robust proof of concept in beta already  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:47):**  running with several ingredients so that people can see how it works and some of the troubleshooting  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:17:55):**  and problem solving that inevitably will come up can sort of be underway and we will have  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:00):**  basically have a pretty powerful and robust information product based on the blockchain  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:06):**  that companies large and small and as well as in customers and producer communities can  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:13):**  all engage with in order to make decisions together about what does regeneration mean  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:21):**  in their shared context.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:23):**  And that's something that's very important to me is that we start to understand that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:28):**  regeneration isn't an abstract ideal.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:32):**  It actually has to be recreated in specific context.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:36):**  So a regenerative agriculture system that has to include the farmer, the businesses  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:43):**  that are engaging with it and the details of the geography, the culture, the context,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:50):**  the ecology.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:51):**  So every place actually is going to have sort of this unique expression and in one year  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:18:57):**  I am really passionately excited to see groups of stakeholders come together in a way where  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:05):**  the blockchain can sort of mediate and capture the conversation and agreements in order to  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:13):**  ask explore what's the highest potential expression of this agricultural system for this entire  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:20):**  group of stakeholders including the living world, including nature.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:26):**  And to ask a bit more technical question, how are you building a blockchain?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:29):**  I mean I've read a lot about it and but it's still not completely clear to me where do  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:33):**  you start from a vision that you just draw in the last few sentences to how do you get  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:40):**  concrete and where do you even start?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:42):**  Well that's a great question.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:45):**  Luckily we have a really great group of allies that have been pioneers in the development  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:52):**  of some of the large blockchain systems.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:19:55):**  We're currently working towards building our vision on the Ethereum platform for a variety  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:03):**  of different reasons, mostly pragmatic.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:07):**  It's the most flexible.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:08):**  Yeah there's such a robust development community right now and several of our allies are very  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:13):**  integral in that community.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:15):**  So it gives us the ability to sort of both know what we don't know and know who to talk  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:21):**  to about that.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:22):**  And I think that's key for businesses who are engaging with the blockchain because it  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:27):**  is pretty esoteric on a lot of levels as is regenerative agriculture interestingly enough.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:32):**  So we have these two sort of highly specialized skills and from my perspective really what  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:40):**  we're doing right now is we're sort of we're working on a project that can marry the technosphere  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:47):**  with the biosphere again so that the tools that we're using, this amazing technology,  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:20:53):**  are working in service to the health of ecosystems, not just extracting value for sort of a utopian  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:01):**  ideal that's disconnected from the health, the sort of basic functional health of our  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:07):**  planet and water and the carbon cycle and biodiversity but instead is interconnected  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:15):**  and interdependent with that health.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:18):**  And so to speak really directly to your question about how are we proceeding technically very  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:26):**  carefully and we're slowly building a team.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:29):**  So our expertise for years has been very grounded in our ability to work with communities and  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:36):**  to work with the soil and to work with the agro ecosystems and all the stakeholders who  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:42):**  engage with that.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:43):**  And so at Terragenesis we've sort of developed a capacity in design for complex ecosystems  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:49):**  and stakeholders and so from our perspective we're approaching the blockchain not as sort  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:21:56):**  of a holy grail but as another member in an existing and complex ecosystem that we're  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:02):**  inviting to the table to infuse the work that's already underway.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:07):**  So we're not looking at the blockchain and asking you know sort of what's the abstract  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:13):**  potential here, we're looking at the blockchain and inviting a conversation about what's the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:18):**  potential in our specific context.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:20):**  And to speak about a specific context can you walk me through let's say again we're  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:24):**  talking a year from now and I'm I was one of them or I'm still one of the people involved  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:30):**  in the pilot.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:31):**  I'm a cocoa farmer in Central America.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:34):**  Of course I'm completely regenerative so I have multiple ingredients that I'm growing  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:37):**  of multiple things that come of my land that might have value and maybe didn't have value  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:41):**  before.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:42):**  How do I engage?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:43):**  Does it work on my phone?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:44):**  What do I do to be part of this stream?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:48):**  Yeah so you're engaging on your phone basically or at a desktop computer at the internet cafe  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:22:56):**  down the road and you're engaging with a platform where you can actually see you know who is  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:03):**  enjoying the chocolate bar made out of your cacao.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:06):**  And you're able to with by engaging with your cooperative, the cooperative that you're a  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:11):**  member, you're able to go on and not only track global commodities prices but also make  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:17):**  decisions sort of informed financial decisions about together with the other with the buyer.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:24):**  You're able to make decisions about the sale price that are informed by the variables that  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:30):**  everyone has decided are important.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:33):**  Quality right so there's a contract about quality and you can test that.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:39):**  Land use is the land use really up to snuff?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:43):**  Are you producing multiple ingredients?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:45):**  Is carbon being sequestered into your agro ecosystem?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:48):**  And not just sort of enforcing things on the farmer but the farmer then gets to look upstream  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:53):**  and say oh is that chocolate business doing what it promised?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:23:58):**  Are they you know are they selling that chocolate bar with a story that's an integrity with  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:06):**  what's really happening on the ground?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:08):**  Are they using my photo fair enough?  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:11):**  Am I getting value for the extra layers of marketing that I supported them with, with  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:18):**  the tour and the photo and other things?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:20):**  So it starts to we start to be able to level the playing field so that the farmer is actually  
**[0:24:26-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:26):**  participating as a user in this market ecosystem instead of just as the sort of the foundation  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:36):**  of a pyramid where value is being extracted.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:39):**  And to ask this stupid question why is that possible now or in the near future with blockchain  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:44):**  and not with all the tools we already have on the internet?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:49):**  Well I actually think it was completely possible before.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:52):**  So why is it not done?  
**[0:24:54-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:24:54):**  So this is just sort of philosophical perspective and I perhaps am going to receive some hate  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:04):**  mail from people who are true believers in blockchain technology.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:08):**  We can handle that.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:10):**  But my belief isn't so much that blockchain is sort of a radical difference.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:19):**  It is that people because people believe it's a radical difference we're having conversations  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:25):**  that people were scared to have before.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:27):**  And so the enormous amount of attention going into the question about what a distributed  
**[0:25:34-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:34):**  economy means and how it could manifest in a way that is in service to not just centralized  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:43):**  sort of economic power but all of the participants of the economy is something that's happening  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:50):**  at an increasingly frequent rate and with higher and higher quality.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:25:55):**  So that discourse is generating the ability from my perspective for people to actually  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:01):**  believe that it's possible.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:02):**  Whereas before something about the conditions meant that most people would just eschew and  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:12):**  say no no that can't actually happen.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:14):**  We can't actually have that kind of a system.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:17):**  I do think you know just a caveat to what I said it's not just sort of the larger shift  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:23):**  in belief that's taking place although that's a big part of it.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:26):**  And I think it shouldn't be the reason why I'm focusing on it is because I think it's  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:30):**  too often times forgotten.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:32):**  I also think that there's some very clear that the power of a distributed ledger of a ledger  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:42):**  that is hosted by everyone not just a single entity who holds all of the cards is enormously  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:49):**  potent and opens up vast realms of possibility that didn't exist just 10 years ago.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah so maybe it's not the we didn't go from 20 percent to 100 or it didn't become 10 times  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:02):**  better or more potent because of the blockchain it did get.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:06):**  I mean there's a development in there that's unique.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:08):**  But because everybody believes it did get 100 times better we suddenly have discussions  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:13):**  investments attention focus.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:15):**  So it actually is becoming better and actually is becoming used which before was only a theoretical  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:20):**  discussion and maybe some research papers that we wrote about the distributed economy  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:24):**  and now actually people are doing it.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:26):**  That's my belief is that it's a combination in the synergy between that that there is  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:32):**  a better tool and it does exist and there are sort of proof of the proof is in the pudding  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:38):**  as they say right.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:39):**  That there are you know Bitcoin is a global phenomenon and the value keeps going up.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:46):**  There's attention there's a massive amount of attention in altcoins there's a massive  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:50):**  amount of attention to a theory and the Ethereum enterprise platform and it's growing.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:27:56):**  And that's bringing attention to the conversation you know just five years ago if I had just  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:03):**  outlined and five years ago frankly I was thinking about all of this stuff and working  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:07):**  on it and I may have said most of the exact same things if you would ask me those questions  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:12):**  just minus the ability to use the blockchain in a way that had you lean in and say oh wow  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:20):**  because I've heard it all over my social media what this guy is saying actually might be  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:25):**  true or it might be possible I think that's the difference.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:28):**  Exactly exactly it might be more than possible it might be a good investment.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:32):**  Because everybody from IBM to your your old hacker geeks friends are talking about it  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:39):**  so there's something there and that that makes it suddenly.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:42):**  That's right and so it's an enormously exciting time I think if we can invite the highly intelligent  
**[0:28:54-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:28:54):**  but somewhat abstract cyber community engaged with the blockchain to really be actively  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:04):**  engaged with how this technology increases the health of ecosystems agricultural systems  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:12):**  and the trade systems that connect humans to those systems will really have something  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:19):**  exciting to be talking about in a year from now.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:23):**  Which is not easy if you see most of the research or the money and investments are flowing towards  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:31):**  making bank transactions faster and just a few milliseconds because they earn on that  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:36):**  and so it's not looking I mean it's not connected to earth literally.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:40):**  That's correct.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:41):**  And I think it's absolutely essential but it's not going to be an easy stretch to get  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:45):**  IBM or whoever looking at ecosystem ecosystems and biospheres etc.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:52):**  They have to at some point anyway but we hope we do it a bit before that.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:29:56):**  Yeah I mean absolutely I agree I mean I think the potential here where I think we're really  
**[0:30:02-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:02):**  very much at a crossroads and the potential is that this technology is only used to optimize  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:12):**  the extractive economy more.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:14):**  But there's another potential and that potential is that this technology is used to engage  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:23):**  in an inquiry about how investment creates multiple forms of return multiple forms of  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:31):**  capital not just financial capital but the living capital that out of which all other  
**[0:30:39-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:39):**  wealth is born and how to actively create ways for us to be engaging and including the  
**[0:30:50-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:50):**  health and vibrance of that living capital pool into our systems of trade.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:30:58):**  And I'm not just as a disclaimer I'm not actually a big fan of just sort of monetizing ecosystem  
**[0:31:06-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:06):**  services because I think that the complexity of living systems is too much to be accounted  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:16):**  for in quotes.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:17):**  So we're really walking a razor's edge here.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:21):**  So I sort of I personally have this philosophical belief that we can't simply just sort of have  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:26):**  a quote unquote true cost economics and internalize all the externalized costs in the form of  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:32):**  ecosystem services and have sort of an economy that works perfectly.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:37):**  I don't actually believe that.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:39):**  However I do believe that some very pragmatic steps in moving forward using block chain  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:46):**  distributed ledger systems for trade and for accounting for ecosystem services is clearly  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:31:54):**  the next step for shifting the economy in a way that actually is serving the health  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:01):**  of the planet and not only needs to happen but already is happening.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:07):**  So there's a certain point here where sort of my personal philosophy is very likely to  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:13):**  be tested.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:16):**  But at the moment I think it's very it's very aligned with what sort of the imperative that  
**[0:32:22-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:22):**  is the exploration of how this technology can serve the communities and ecosystems that  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:31):**  are the foundation for all whether we believe it or not all of the wealth that's being exchanged  
**[0:32:37-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:37):**  in a millisecond in a nanosecond as financial capital liquidity actually sublimates and  
**[0:32:45-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:45):**  gasifies and turns into sort of this global omnipresent ether that makes transactions  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:54):**  instantaneous.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:32:56):**  That can only be supported with a very clear connection with the slower rhythms of planetary  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:02):**  health.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:03):**  Yeah at the end I don't know who did the quote but it's you can't eat money at the end.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:08):**  There's always and a lot of people live a bit of outside that biosphere or think they  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:12):**  live outside the biosphere until they stopped.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:15):**  But I think it's an interesting the true cost is an interesting example of extracting companies  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:21):**  thinking about their externalities and letting these reports being written and then usually  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:27):**  get really scared because they are actually making a huge loss if you even if you just  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:31):**  internalize a few of the externalities because most of them you simply cannot even measure.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:36):**  You get quite far right but already with only maybe half of it or a third etc.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:41):**  They are way deep in there in the red numbers if you start calculating that.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:46):**  So maybe it serves as a wake up call that their supply chain as they are still calling  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:50):**  that is in fact broken or at least not functioning if you look at the bigger picture.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:57):**  That's right.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:58):**  It's a huge step.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:33:59):**  It's a huge step and the companies and investors who invest and that's so that sort of true  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:05):**  cost and internalization of externalities is going to happen I believe because there's  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:12):**  growing awareness and growing pressure.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:14):**  It's sort of the writing's already on the wall.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:16):**  Companies aren't going to be able they'll find ways to externalize but many of the things  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:21):**  are externalizing right now will they will be forced to internalize and companies and  
**[0:34:27-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:27):**  investors who realize that that's happening that that that trend is underway and sort  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:35):**  of in the process of actualizing into the economy and the disruptive force that that  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:40):**  will create people who have the foresight to invest in regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:47):**  in the systems of supply and technology that support regenerative agriculture will be in  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:53):**  a very solid position for the new economy that's being born because those are industries  
**[0:34:59-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:34:59):**  where there are no externalities where the net benefit to the system is greater than  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:08):**  the cost and that I think even just as a hedge right that even there's a small probability  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:16):**  that what I just said is true it's worth investing significant amount of capital.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:21):**  So I fully believe that even if you know we could invest 10 or 15 percent of the available  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:33):**  financial capital that's buzzing around the planet right now in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:39):**  and the foundation of the regenerative economy in the next two or three years we would change  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:43):**  the world we would change the world it would completely transform things and and that to  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:48):**  me is a very attractive proposition to investors because if you're saying you know look we  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:35:54):**  need a group of you know five hedge funds and you know a hundred venture capital funds  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:02):**  and we want all of you to dedicate 10 percent of your assets to this project not our project  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:10):**  in specific I couldn't even metabolize that amount of capital but the larger project of  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:15):**  you know regenerating the agro ecosystem and the system of supply as the foundation for  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:20):**  a new bioeconomy and invested in the land base for that and the technology for that  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:27):**  and you know all of the other aspects the upskilling that's going to need to take place  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:34):**  and all of the myriad millions of different exciting business opportunities everything  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:40):**  from sharing economy eco tourism plays to real estate ventures I mean there's a lot  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:46):**  there that could be very attractive if just 10 percent of investment portfolio of like  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:52):**  I said you know five or ten hedge funds and a hundred venture capital groups we would  
**[0:36:57-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:36:57):**  have enough working capital to actually change the direction from you know pending doom of  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:07):**  our biosphere and our ability to live here where we have to go to Mars or something you  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:14):**  know in a futurist scenario to a vibrant earth where humans are actually living in a way  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:21):**  that's coherent with the health of the larger ecosystem and we can still go to Mars and  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:26):**  do all those other things so yeah we still have 90 percent left that's right we can pay  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:31):**  for a few rockets that we still have plenty of capital and I believe that eventually many  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:35):**  of much of that capital would cycle down will flow in as we'll show the different ways to  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:43):**  return not in an infinite growth economy that's based on extracting more value and producing  
**[0:37:51-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:51):**  more needless goods and marketing it but the new burgeoning economy of creativity where  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:37:59):**  the knowledge that is born out of this exploration shows a myriad of different returns on investment  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:05):**  and let's say we're in front of a theater full of smart impact investors or as all investors  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:12):**  including us think we're smart what would you say what would be the first step they're  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:16):**  all interested or excited after after this half an hour and they want to get in where  
**[0:38:22-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:22):**  do you start and what should you look out for well so of course give me a call I'm always  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:31):**  happy to chat but you know that aside in a sort of general pattern level I think the  
**[0:38:38-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:38):**  places to start are really where are you as an investor interested and passionate about  
**[0:38:48-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:48):**  what and what are the linkages with your existing investment portfolio to regenerative economy  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:38:57):**  and a regenerative agro economy because there's enough complexity here that you know you can't  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:04):**  just dive in to you know project X that's all the way across the world and expect to  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:11):**  have good venture returns you need to be investing in places where you have some ability to sort  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:17):**  of vet the potential for success because there'll be many good ideas out there but not all of  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:23):**  them will have a solid return because not all of them will succeed I mean that's why  
**[0:39:27-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:27):**  we're all in this in the end is because we love to gamble and be right so find the places  
**[0:39:35-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:35):**  where you can be right and concentrate on asking the question what does this sort of  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:44):**  sector whether it's commodities sort of bulk commodities or you know vegetables and grocery  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:39:53):**  or confectionery and cacao or cosmetics or real estate what does this place where I already  
**[0:40:01-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:01):**  have some understanding of the way the extractive conventional economy looks what might a play  
**[0:40:10-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:10):**  look like in the new disruptive distributed regenerative economy look like in this place  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:18):**  where I'm already excited about right do a little mapping and then start to look for  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:24):**  people who are active in those places and have conversations with them I mean that's  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:28):**  a very practical roadmap for engaging I think the most important from my perspective the  
**[0:40:34-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:34):**  most important place to engage right now actually is in the information side of this we need  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:43):**  to figure out how to monetize the knowledge economy around regenerative agriculture so  
**[0:40:49-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:49):**  that we can rapidly accelerate our research and development of agro ecosystems and that  
**[0:40:58-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:40:58):**  to me is is you know complimentary with this play into the blockchain are the two highest  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:07):**  leverage places to begin the conversation about regenerative agriculture investing so  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:12):**  what does R&D in regenerative agriculture look like it looks like investing in the potential  
**[0:41:19-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:19):**  to have model farms in every ecosystem across the planet that are basically highly monitored  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:27):**  and wired so that the practices both ancestral and indigenous as well as modern that increased  
**[0:41:35-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:35):**  biodiversity and increase soil carbon and increase the health of the the whole ecosystem  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:42):**  increase the quality of the products that come out of it can be monitored and then used  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:47):**  to extrapolate into this larger global system of value exchange you know people who invest  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:52):**  in that and companies who have that kind of capacity to share that information in a to  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:41:59):**  share that information in a distributed but monetized way with a global economy are going  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:42:05):**  to have enormous capacity not only to make big moves in the future but also to have a  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:42:10):**  steady income stream because everybody needs that information so those would be the two  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:42:16):**  places where where I personally would start from my vantage point.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:42:20):**  I want to thank you so much Gregory for for taking the time today and sharing your knowledge

**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/#t=0:46:28):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:35):**  always love to ask at the beginning.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:37):**  What brings you to planting trees all over the world basically?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:42):**  Good afternoon, everybody.

**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:44):**  At Landlife, I'm responsible for the technology department.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:49):**  And to answer the question for me was totally I rolled into this.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:53):**  I was just lucky to come in contact with the concept of planting trees in dry areas.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:02:59):**  My background is not as the gentleman on my right in Wageningen in arid agriculture or  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:05):**  in forestry, but it's in business administration, after which I worked for multiple corporates  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:11):**  and through contact with one of the founders of Landlife company, Edoard Sanne, I rolled  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:16):**  into planting trees in dry areas.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:19):**  So for me, it has been mostly on the job training and falling in love with traveling to all  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:25):**  these very weird but very interesting places and talking not in high glass buildings, but  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:31):**  on fields with farmers and thinking about what to plant where.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:35):**  So totally random in my case.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:39):**  So Larry, what has been your journey to this weird company?  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:42):**  That's an interesting question, but let me first start that I have in the background  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:48):**  at Wageningen Agriculture University, a background in tropical crop sciences.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:03:54):**  And actually I fell in love with desert climates and being in desert climates, I was very intrigued  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:00):**  to see how plants and trees are growing over there.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:04):**  And working at Landlife gives me the opportunity to put things into practice.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:08):**  And I'm very fond of that.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:09):**  I'm very proud of it too.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:12):**  And I'm working at Landlife company as head of research and development, giving me the  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:16):**  opportunity to work on methodologies as well as products which could advance tree growth  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:23):**  in desert areas, or especially here in dry lands.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:27):**  And also I can make use of my economical background looking specifically to the plant physiological  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:33):**  aspects of trees and to see how they manage under dry conditions.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:38):**  And in my perspective, you see trees which are spenders, you see trees which are savers.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:45):**  And those are same traits you see in human people when they are facing environmental  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:51):**  risks.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:52):**  Super.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:53):**  And Koen, last member who joined the team recently, what has been your journey?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:57):**  My journey up to now?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:04:59):**  Well, I'm a biologist, really deciding to be a biologist at the age of eight or so,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:06):**  or 10, something like that.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:08):**  I really wanted to know everything about plants and birds and insects.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:13):**  So I really studied biology to understand biology.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:18):**  Doing biology first in Groningen, then Wageningen, working on meadow birds and in estuaries and  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:26):**  lots of different projects.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:29):**  And then coming to trees, and trees are really fascinating organisms, standing on a single  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:34):**  place for centuries and having to cope with anything that goes by.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:39):**  So I have very much a scientific background.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:42):**  I'm working now as a professor at Wageningen University.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:46):**  I think done lots of research related to tree functioning, forest systems, climate change,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:55):**  now bio-economy and so on.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:05:58):**  And for me, this is a very conscious decision, really to say, okay, I've been working now

**[0:06:11-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:11):**  okay, it is really necessary to use trees, to use forests, to sequester carbon, to protect  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:19):**  biodiversity, to protect areas and soils, and to hand them over in a better state to  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:25):**  the next generation.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:27):**  So and let's say companies like this, I mean, the science and the government are not going  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:33):**  to do this.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:34):**  That is a too lengthy, too inefficient kind of process.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:39):**  So you really need, let's say, a kind of can-do organization.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:44):**  And let's say land life is very much a can-do organization, starting communicating with  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:49):**  businesses, getting the thing done.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:53):**  So that is really, really fascinating and the next step for me to bring, well, what  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:06:59):**  I can bring in this company, background in science and network and understanding of trees  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:06):**  and trees functioning and see to get this operational, well, in this surrounding.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:13):**  So that's my motivation.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:15):**  Coming back to Arnoud for a second, could you give us the last, I wouldn't say two and  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:21):**  a half year download because that's quite a bit, but a short update where Land Life  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:26):**  Company is now, what are your main focus points that maybe were different, let's say, three  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:33):**  years ago?  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:35):**  I'm just going back to the total beginning to stretch your question, Koen.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:41):**  We started focused on the Cocoon, a product that we use to protect trees and to grow them  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:46):**  in dry areas.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:48):**  This is probably 2014 and the first half of 2015 was purely on product development.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:07:54):**  Harry and I going to the Gama and the Praxis here in Holland to get stuff to improve the  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:00):**  product went obviously through a lot of iterations and then started in 2015 in the second half  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:06):**  to plant trees in the field and use the product.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:09):**  Many a time we've been high-fiving in Amsterdam after a lab test showed that we were either  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:13):**  water tightness or it could handle certain stresses and heat and then in the field obviously  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:19):**  you would get the in-situ situation of termites eating it or goats eating the tree shelter  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:24):**  or even baboons hitting each other with a tree shelter.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:27):**  We learned a lot from the field experience.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:30):**  As I said, we went through multiple revisions of the product and we feel, I think in 2017  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:38):**  that we really had something that we could apply in a lot of different areas, mainly  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:41):**  obviously focusing on dry areas.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:44):**  Then the last two and a half years we really went from a product oriented companies, basically  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:50):**  a seller of cocoons to an end-to-end reforestation company.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:56):**  What did that mean?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:08:57):**  That meant that we are a project developer from the nursery, basically from seed to the  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:02):**  nursery to the planting and to all the monitoring of a project afterwards.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:08):**  From a standpoint of accountability and transparency and project management, Landlife has moved  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:15):**  into that area, which is why now our clients pay us either for per hectare or per tonne  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:21):**  CO2 sequestered.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:22):**  So the business model really shifted from per cocoon to outcome-based finance-based.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:30):**  And how has this shift been?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:33):**  How difficult has it been, I think outcome-based is something many, many people in the sector  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:37):**  would love to do.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:39):**  What would be a tip or how has the journey been to switch more to those outcome-based  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:44):**  structures?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:45):**  Well, on the one hand, we were lucky that on a macro level, I mean, and Koen can attest  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:53):**  to this, but the climate has not been helping the world, which means that companies, organizations,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:09:59):**  foundations like ours have been lucky in a sense that there's a lot of policy being developed.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:05):**  Think of the Paris Accords and think of the shipping industry or the airline industry  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:10):**  that are now becoming more responsible for their CO2 outputs and that they need solutions.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:16):**  And yes, there's a big UN program called REDD+, which you probably covered many times in this  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:21):**  podcast and other types of CO2 sequestration, but nothing on the level that the world needs.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:29):**  And we'll get into that later.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:31):**  But also the way in which reforestation has been done is a pretty traditional industry.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:36):**  So it's planting trees.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:37):**  Obviously, the people on the ground know what species they want to use and they monitor  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:42):**  to an extent, but there has been nothing on a global level, not a lot of science being  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:48):**  done for the simple reason that there's not a lot of money to be made.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:51):**  So in agriculture, obviously there is a return.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:54):**  In timber, there's a return.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:55):**  So there's more research and development, I would say, in those areas than there is  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:10:59):**  in nature restoration.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:02):**  And that shift is happening.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:03):**  And to answer your question, we've been riding that wave towards the company we're becoming  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:09):**  and are planning to become on the basis that clients are interested in the outcomes and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:15):**  the way to get to these outcomes and to, in our case, plant at larger scale, lower cost  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:21):**  and at speed are becoming more and more important.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:24):**  And could you explain a key example or a company or project or client you're working with or  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:32):**  you have worked with and it's done that you could obviously share something to show that  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:36):**  end to end?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:37):**  Like what is a customer?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:40):**  What is one you would like to share to give an example of this process, this transformation  
**[0:11:45-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:45):**  from going from cocoon to selling end to end full reforestation project?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:53):**  Good question.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:54):**  So our clients before this shift were mainly, let's say, the city of Los Angeles or the  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:11:59):**  Mexican government or the Spanish government.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:02):**  So more on the government side, both local, federal and sometimes multinational in UNHCR  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:08):**  or the UN.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:09):**  The shift now and as example, I'd say corporates, we work for a Dutch company called Leaseplan,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:15):**  which has millions of cars around the world that they lease out to clients.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:20):**  And they are planning to become fully electric in 2030.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:23):**  But they realize that before 2030, all the cars that they have on the road are going  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:27):**  to be, yeah, they're going to be spending CO2.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:31):**  They're not going to be zero emission for sure.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:33):**  No zero emission.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:34):**  So yeah, their goal is to be fully electric in 2030.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:37):**  But up to that time and up to that time, all the CO2 that is expended, they want to sequester.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:43):**  So a company like that came to us and we could exactly work out what that means per car,

**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:51):**  And they wanted to plant trees and not only plant trees and sequester CO2, but also do  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:12:56):**  ecosystem services, engage the local community, but also their company.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:00):**  So we've had two trips now to Spain where there's local managers or managers from Amsterdam  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:04):**  coming and also planting these trees and working in that project.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:08):**  And they, they're a client and they pay us for the amount of CO2 we sequester.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:13):**  And you find the land, you find the species, you find the local contractors, et cetera,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:18):**  to basically do that.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:20):**  Yes.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:21):**  And because that is the setup, that is also why we are engaging in a process called data  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:27):**  driven planting, where we basically want to plant as much trees as possible in a planting  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:32):**  season.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:33):**  We want to do it at the lowest cost possible and at the lowest impact to nature.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:37):**  So you can imagine if you use excavators, but also people or pickup trucks, you go into  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:42):**  the land and you do tree planting, that there's a pressure on nature that you would rather  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:46):**  do once.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:47):**  And that is why we are keeping the cost down and expanding the scale at which we can do  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:51):**  this to make sure that there's also a profit for us.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:13:54):**  So there's a conscious choice that we made to become a private company.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:00):**  The goal is not to put Ferraris in our driveways, but it is to plant as many Tesla's, but to  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:05):**  plant as many trees as, as possible, but to do go and engage into these contracts and  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:11):**  build these machines and develop these machines that can do this at scale.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:16):**  We felt it was necessary to become a private company.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:18):**  Yeah, I think it's the, the restoration industry that you've referred to previously, but also  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:24):**  others that hasn't really existed.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:26):**  I don't think there's anything being even close to data driven planting or a company  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:33):**  approach to that, which could be good and bad.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:35):**  I mean, we can have a discussion about it obviously, but bringing the cost down of planting  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:38):**  and the success rate up in the gazillion trees we need to plant probably is a good thing.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:43):**  And what's the land like?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:44):**  Like just in the example of Spain, that's been, what kind of land are you targeting  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:50):**  in this case?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:51):**  Well, in Europe, that's mostly, so you can imagine for tree planting, it makes sense  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:14:56):**  to have a relatively level piece of land, as little rocks as possible, especially if  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:03):**  you go into the field with machinery.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:05):**  And in a sense for us, that's lucky that in Europe, there's a lot of abandoned agriculture  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:11):**  land.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:12):**  That's either used for animal husbandry or agriculture.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:15):**  Spain is a good example.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:16):**  We always joke that the villages in which we plant the youngest person is 60 or 70.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:21):**  And there's a lot of urbanization in Spain.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:23):**  A lot of youth has moved to the cities to get jobs, don't want to work the fields.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:28):**  So that's another reason why we come in with a lot of mechanization.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:31):**  But these areas are very much of interest to us because there's a lot of erosion going  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:36):**  on, mainly wind erosion in areas like Spain.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:39):**  They're doing nothing with the land and nature is not coming back unaided.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:43):**  So that's a big issue.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:44):**  I mean, we can debate with Kuhn probably that in 50 years or 100 years, trees will start  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:49):**  and there will be a primary species coming back.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:52):**  But to speed that up is why we plant there.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:15:55):**  So it won't rewild in itself in time to be a function for CO2 capture.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:03):**  That's probably, yeah.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:05):**  I mean, in the end, nature will come back.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:08):**  Or it becomes desert.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:09):**  It almost always does.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:11):**  Or it becomes, in this case, yeah.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:12):**  That's true.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:14):**  And to stay in Spain, but now switch more to the technical guys on the other side of  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:18):**  the table.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:19):**  I mean, how do you have been involved in that project probably from the beginning?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:22):**  What are the considerations when you find a piece of land or even choosing a piece of  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:26):**  land looking at the species of these big questions of what to plant, where and why, and in this  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:33):**  case also how, because you have to invent a lot of this machinery actually, because  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:37):**  there are not too many hands that can help you.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:39):**  What's the process there that you personally, but also land life company goes through?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:44):**  Well, we first start to assess soil and climate.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:49):**  It's sort of the combination of the agroecological zoning that we see what are the challenges  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:56):**  we are facing.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:57):**  But you're also looking at the current vegetation.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:16:59):**  We really like to work with indigenous vegetation and not to introduce species which may become  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:05):**  invasive.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:07):**  From there you already can work on a short list.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:09):**  And also when you're working in those areas, you also have to look at what landowners would  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:15):**  like to have.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:16):**  Because at the end of the day, we would like to have planting trees which stay there for  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:19):**  at least decades and want to make sure that the trees which we are planting will not be  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:24):**  cut down prematurely.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:26):**  So we also would like to add trees which have additional value for timber or other purposes,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:31):**  which makes it for the landowners interesting to maintain the trees on their lands.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:36):**  And those are sort of basic considerations.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:40):**  And based on what Arno has been mentioning on data driven planting, we are collecting  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:44):**  information on which tree species is growing on which type of soil under which kind of  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:50):**  land conditions that we can already select the best species in there.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:17:55):**  Also looking into tree provenances, which are genotypes which are ideally fit to that  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:00):**  specific area.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:03):**  And just something on scale.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:05):**  How many hectares are we talking about here?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:07):**  This is not a few trees on a small piece of land just in terms of just to for the public  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:12):**  to have an idea of size that we're talking about here.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:15):**  We're talking about hundreds of hectares to start off with.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:19):**  How many trees are there?

**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:25):**  per hectare.

**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:28):**  And when you do the site scouting and the type, do you also look at the carbon potential  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:35):**  of the trees?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:36):**  Yes, we do.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:37):**  Is there a big difference?  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:38):**  Because I'm relatively new to the reforestation sector.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:42):**  What are differences between one type and another one?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:45):**  Sorry, I see Koolen actually wants to ask.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:48):**  Well, the kind of magnitude is huge, clearly depending on local conditions, water, nutrients  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:55):**  and so on.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:18:56):**  But sure, at the low end, two, three tons can be stored.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:00):**  Two, three tons per?  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:02):**  Per hectare per year.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:03):**  Yeah, okay, sorry.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:04):**  But there's also quite a large difference in the maximum stock that can be stored there.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:11):**  So we have a growth rate and it can be high, but if the turnover is fast, then the total  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:16):**  stock will not be very high.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:19):**  So the advantage of dry and poor areas is that it can have fast stocks.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:25):**  For instance, in Spain, there's this whole oak system that used to have a copper system,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:31):**  a huge amount of carbon still in the roots in soil.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:35):**  So the above ground is not so high, the growth is not so high, but the amount of carbon that  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:39):**  you can store in the system is huge.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:41):**  Okay, can you explain that a bit?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:43):**  Because you mentioned the number of systems that I think we should unpack.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:47):**  All right.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:48):**  Yes, but you have, well, surely you have forest and forested systems where the trees grow  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:54):**  above ground and the faster it grows, the more carbon you store.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:19:58):**  But in the long end, let's say that the carbon is more secured in soil, surely, that's most  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:05):**  stable.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:06):**  So the carbon storage capacity of the soil is in the end, in the long term, surely a  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:12):**  critical component if you move towards landscape scale restoration, the scale is really important  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:18):**  there, is one of the components to consider what kind of soil and what kind of different  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:23):**  components store not only in rates, how fast it accumulates carbon, but what is the intent  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:32):**  pool that can be captured there.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:35):**  And is there a big difference then in types of tree, like the type of tree that release  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:40):**  the stores or enables this carbon to be stored in the soil?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:45):**  Is that very tree dependent?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:46):**  Yes, surely, because some trees, I mean, for the harder trees, if you're a home oak, stone  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:52):**  oak, it decomposes very, very slowly.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:20:55):**  So growth rate are very slow, but the decomposition is even much, much less.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:00):**  So at the end of the day, you store then much more of, let's say, the hardwood trees than  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:05):**  if you take poplar or willow and so on.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:07):**  It grows fast, but it's in the end.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:10):**  Because the storage happens when the tree dies and is being absorbed by the soil or  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:14):**  it happens through the roots?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:16):**  Both the roots as well as branches and foliage and so on, so that whole system, ecosystem  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:24):**  component is really crucial to take into account and also in your decision of species choice  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:31):**  in the local.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:33):**  And another thing, what you mentioned, scale.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:35):**  Scale is really important because you have, you really build in a forest, a kind of forest  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:42):**  environment.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:43):**  And the forest kind of creates its own environment in its sense.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:47):**  So tens and hundreds of hectares are good.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:50):**  At the end of the day, you really need to restate landscapes, catchments.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:21:56):**  So there you have, let's say, you build a fully functioning system and then you're not  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:01):**  only talking about trees, you do talk about trees, grasses, and surely the most of the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:08):**  carbon will be stored in trees, but this spatial component and how that entire landscape is  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:15):**  functioning in combination in what people accept.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:19):**  So the role of people there is surely crucial in what you can promise in the end of the  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:25):**  day to customers.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:26):**  It's not only the forest, but the local owners need to accept and feel ownership with what  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:35):**  you rebuild.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:36):**  If that ownership is not there, you're really making a kind of, yes, then in the end of  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:43):**  the day, what I often say, if you say, well, first I was just in Nepal and nobody is allowed  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:49):**  to use the trees.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:52):**  So in that sense, the value of the tree is the value of the match.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:22:56):**  And with lots and lots of fires there, people put it in fire and it burns because you cannot  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:02):**  use it.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:03):**  So that connection to the local people, there's lots of community forest and that landscape  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:09):**  you need to connect it.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:10):**  And then you can really build landscapes which are established and which are durable in the  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:16):**  long term.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:17):**  And as you, as a company are moving into landscape scale, how difficult is it to, there's a question  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:28):**  for three of you, let's see who answer first, but how difficult is it to pick the places  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:36):**  and what to plan where?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:38):**  Because it's so vast and you have so many variables.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:42):**  What's the process now?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:43):**  Let's ask first, when you go into a landscape, what's the process now?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:45):**  Is it very manual?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:46):**  Is it data driven?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:47):**  Are there software pieces?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:49):**  Maybe the operation, let's say maybe to finish on this, let's say ecological component, my  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:23:56):**  head, what I'm going to bring into one of the elements is resilience.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:01):**  So can we build resilience there?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:03):**  And you said, okay, the nature will restore itself.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:06):**  In many cases it will not.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:08):**  If you have a justification, as you mentioned, it's drying up, then this is self enforcing  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:13):**  process.

**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:20):**  a forest fully, let's say natural ecosystem, which is also bouncing back into the forest

**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:33):**  And one of the critical elements there is diversity.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:36):**  That is both in provenances, which are adapted not only to current conditions, but also future  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:42):**  conditions.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:43):**  So that is a challenge.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:44):**  How local do you get, given that the climate is going to change to future conditions?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:52):**  That's an element to tackle.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:55):**  What is tree species composition?  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:24:56):**  How do you distribute forest, non forest and watershed?  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:02):**  That adaptive capacity in the forest you want to develop at the landscape level.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:08):**  Well, that is, let's say, the technical challenge, engineering question.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:15):**  And then you have, let's say, the operational, how to find the areas.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:19):**  Yeah, you're in Spain, a good example is, and people often worry about that, but Spain  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:26):**  is actually the first European country that really has to deal with decertification.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:30):**  And then everybody thinks Andalusia and the south of Spain, yes, to an extent, but the  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:36):**  largest desert in Europe is actually to the north east of Zaragoza.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:40):**  So pretty much in the northern part of the country.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:45):**  And Spanish government's own figures, there's 10 million hectares of degraded land.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:50):**  Now degraded can mean different things.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:51):**  And there's different stages to that.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:53):**  But what's that in a percentage of total Spanish agricultural land?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:25:57):**  Is it 10%, 5%, 50%?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:00):**  Cool, that's a difficult question.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:02):**  I will find the details and put it in the transcript below.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:05):**  It is huge.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:06):**  I think it's...  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:07):**  It sounds huge, but I just have no idea of context.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:10):**  I just think of an area which you can mention afterwards.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:14):**  I will put it in there.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:15):**  I will find out and put it in the details.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:18):**  Yeah, but for us, it means years and years of work.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:20):**  Just to put it in a simple term.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:22):**  How many trees were that for?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:23):**  10 million hectares is a lot of trees.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:25):**  Now so we actually work there with the local government of the largest province, Castilla  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:32):**  y León, so Madrid to the northwest, which is a huge area for us, which is good.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:37):**  In place, there's a lot of abandoned agricultural land, as I mentioned, so a lot of opportunity  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:42):**  for us to plant.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:43):**  Most of it is publicly owned, which helps us.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:47):**  And there are laws in Spain that protect the forest.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:50):**  So things like you're not allowed to cut a forest, to the Nepal example.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:26:56):**  But here the Spanish government does a good job in discussing with the villagers what  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:01):**  do we want with this land?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:02):**  Can we plant trees here?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:04):**  Can we also plant nut types or can we do other types of, as Harry always says, you can't  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:09):**  eat CO2 credits.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:11):**  So what can we add to the forest?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:13):**  Can there be selective timber?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:16):**  Can we have jobs in the maintenance, in the fire protection, in the fencing, etc.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:20):**  So there's a lot of debate how you can embed this really with the local population.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:25):**  And then we get assigned several pieces of land and then our technology basically takes  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:30):**  over, to be honest.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:31):**  So we get several options.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:33):**  And then we use drone and satellite imagery to go back, look at vegetation that is there  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:40):**  now but also what used to be done on the land.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:42):**  Was there agriculture?  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:43):**  What kind of fertilizer was used?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:45):**  Was there animal husbandry?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:46):**  What kind of animals?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:48):**  And from there we take soil samples very simply.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:51):**  We take soil moisture measurements.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:54):**  And then we come back to the brilliant minds on the right of me and to our database, which  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:27:59):**  has more than a half a million trees and more than probably 40 projects in there.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:05):**  And we look at what type of trees we can plant there.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:08):**  This is also something that you discuss with local nurseries, but you look at the different  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:13):**  tree species that we can plant.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:15):**  And then we come up with things like what density do we want to plant?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:19):**  Is it a north facing slope?  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:21):**  So we need a certain species of tree or a south facing slope, which has to be more drought  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:25):**  tolerant.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:26):**  Is there salinity in the soil?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:27):**  What is the density?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:29):**  Do we have to plant in clusters, in lines?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:32):**  Do we need to do key line or contour planting to harvest as much water as possible if there's  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:37):**  rain events?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:38):**  Obviously, things like hydrology and climate, future climate models.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:44):**  And then Koen is also going to be there for the modeling and the simulation because the  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:48):**  client in this sense would also be what are his objectives?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:51):**  Is it habitat restoration?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:53):**  Is it straight nature restoration?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:55):**  Is it CO2 sequestration or a combination of ecosystem services?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:28:59):**  And then out comes a blueprint basically of how we want to plant.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:04):**  And then Harry and my job and land life operations job is how fast can we plant that?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:09):**  Because as both of the Wageningen minds say, scale is important.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:15):**  And a planting window, as we know in the northern hemisphere, is often spring and fall, but  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:19):**  only two months in spring, maybe two, one and a half in fall.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:23):**  And to maximize that, there are mechanization that we have to use.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:28):**  So once we plant, that's the last part of this is also the monitoring.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:33):**  So we learn from what we do.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:35):**  We have that.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:36):**  Just to interrupt, the 500,000 trees you mentioned, the database is your, those are your former  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:44):**  projects that you're monitoring to find out what's working in terms of setup, scale up,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:50):**  density, type, slope, et cetera, et cetera.

**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:54):**  It's your experience of the last years of planting trees.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:29:59):**  So in general, what you do is you have data like which nursery is a tree from, what kind  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:05):**  of soil type is there, depends if it's homogeneous or heterogeneous, of course.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:09):**  But there are some general items that are in the database, but then each tree, we have  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:15):**  a GPS log.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:16):**  So lat long, which is unique for a tree.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:19):**  Then we register the species, obviously the vigor rating, which is kind of qualitative,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:24):**  but it's a scale of how healthy a tree is.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:26):**  You can look at things like animal damage, branching, length of the tree, the diameter  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:31):**  of the stem, and you track that over time.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:34):**  And you can overlay that with a climate model to see what tree has done better, but also  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:40):**  things like we planted this type of tree in May, but also in February.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:45):**  What happened?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:46):**  What is the best period of time to plant that tree?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:47):**  Does it do better on a south facing slope or does it do better in a valley or on a slope?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:52):**  Or is it better for erosion or for CO2 sequestration?  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:56):**  So all those elements we gather.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:30:59):**  The first process is just by a handheld device, an app that we developed to register the tree.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:06):**  I was going to ask, how do you do that?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:07):**  Is it a drone that looks at the healthiness of the tree or it's one of you guys that says  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:13):**  this one like manual input into your app?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:17):**  How has the data been logged so far?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:20):**  Yeah, ground based is both.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:21):**  So one is manually and instead of going in the field with pen and paper, we have evolved  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:25):**  through several techniques, but now we have a very simple and quick and very accurate  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:30):**  GPS technique on a mobile phone or an iPad.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:33):**  But what we really want to do is, and what we have is on the machine, have a system to  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:39):**  register that which would go automatic and faster because you can imagine doing it by  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:44):**  hand.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:45):**  You can go in the field and it takes a while to do thousands of trees.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:48):**  With a drone, that whole game changes.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:50):**  So in-house, we are, so before us are again the Wageningen Mines, but we also have data  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:31:56):**  scientists and a GIS specialist, a map making specialist that are writing algorithms with  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:04):**  a drone to be able to capture every tree we've planted.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:07):**  Because at some point, about a meter and a half, two meters high, you can pick up the  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:11):**  tree by drone by photogrammetry technology.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:15):**  And when they're three to four meters high, you can pick them up with satellites.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:19):**  So at some point, the whole planting goes into the database automatically, but the first  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:24):**  baseline ground truthing is done by hand still.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:28):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:29):**  And then you come to the question, which types of trees?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:32):**  I mean, you start to see lines obviously, but are you at a point yet where you are comfortable  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:39):**  at making those decisions?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:41):**  I mean, is your data set and time big enough to say, okay, I'm promising, I'm selling this  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:47):**  type of, this quantity of CO2, and I'm fairly confident that we can deliver and the trees  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:52):**  are still alive and that that go?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:54):**  Or where are you in your journey in that?  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:32:57):**  Again, staying with Spain, and we've planted there since 2016.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:02):**  And in the northern, northwestern part of the country on a larger scale since 2017,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:08):**  we're fairly comfortable in knowing what species to use, where, what the density should be  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:13):**  and the clusters.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:14):**  But the using machine learning and artificial intelligence on the scale that we want is  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:20):**  probably a year to two years out.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:23):**  In other areas, I mean, the goal is at some point-  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:25):**  I'm going to come back in two years to check this obviously, because we're very interested  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:28):**  in who's putting the, who starts answering almost this question of what to plant where  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:35):**  and why and what kind of supercomputer can we use to at least answer part of that.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:40):**  But I think it makes a lot of sense, obviously, when your data set is big enough, you start  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:44):**  to see lines with the brilliant minds of Wageningen on the other side of the table to speed up  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:49):**  a lot of things, especially as larger projects come in.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:52):**  But you say one to two years, what's the biggest hurdle at the moment?  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:55):**  Is it software?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:56):**  Is it data?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:33:58):**  It's well, one is data, yes.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:01):**  So the amount of data that we need to do this has to be larger and especially on the machine  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:06):**  learning side, it's like teaching a computer to recognize a cat on your screen.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:10):**  You need a lot of images.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:12):**  The goal is at some point to be able to recognize a species, the length, the vigor, all from  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:17):**  the sky.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:18):**  So you need a lot of data to do that.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:21):**  For now, we're doing that mostly on our own projects.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:24):**  And as we are a young company and trees are not the fastest growers in the world, that  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:27):**  simply is a natural system that will take a little while.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:32):**  But as you can imagine, if we do three flights of a field per year, there's a lot of data  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:37):**  coming in, especially if it's 150,000 trees in one area, then it goes relatively fast.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:42):**  So the two years is maybe on the long side, because now Coen and Harry can go into the  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:47):**  database and already determine certain aspects of what to plant, what not to plant, what  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:54):**  to do in the fall, what to do in the spring.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:34:56):**  So there's already decisions that we take based on the data, but that is growing faster  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:00):**  and faster as time progresses and as the amount of data that we capture progresses.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:06):**  And I'm going to ask instead of the entrepreneur and the operation guy to the science guys,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:10):**  what do you think is the biggest hurdle to really get to that level to do hundreds of  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:15):**  thousands of trees and pretty well and accurately predict also with changing climate, like you  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:21):**  mentioned before Coen and Harry, it's a question to both of you.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:23):**  What do you see as the biggest hurdles from your work on selecting these and creating  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:27):**  these resilient first?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:31):**  Surely access to data and available data is crucial and it really is unique.

**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:42):**  but globally.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:43):**  So that means that even with short time series and for the coming years, we will have short  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:49):**  time series, then we have a huge environmental range and a large range in climate types,  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:35:57):**  in soil types and in treatment types.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:01):**  So because that environmental range is so huge, you hope and to expect that within years  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:09):**  we would be able to give an answer on your question.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:13):**  And surely we can connect what has been done elsewhere.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:17):**  So there is data available, not a lot compared to agriculture or whatever.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:23):**  But surely there are sites which have longer time series, where trees have been measured.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:29):**  We can look back in time if we sample trees and core them and do some chronological time  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:36):**  series.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:37):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:38):**  You cut a tree and you look at the tree rings.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:42):**  So how fast has it been growing at a particular site?  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:45):**  That can only be done at a head not comparable.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:47):**  You don't do thousands of trees there.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:49):**  But at least you get a feeling, hey, you can do tens and say, okay, this has been growing  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:54):**  there so fast.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:36:57):**  That is the kind of information you already can get.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:00):**  Now surely for the modeling, it is usually important because without data, you have no  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:05):**  use of whatsoever model and no use of whatever brain that you need the data.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:12):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:13):**  And another aspect there which is critical is diversity, as I mentioned.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:20):**  Diversity is a kind of risk management approach.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:24):**  So surely we cannot know now which species, which provenance, where to plant and to guarantee  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:32):**  growth by so and so much.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:34):**  But we can say, okay, if you have that level of genetic species diversity, maybe at landscape  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:42):**  scale ecosystem diversity, okay, at least a system is able to adapt to those conditions.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:50):**  And then we have a much more solid argument what it can deliver.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:37:55):**  And what is also increasingly clear is that biodiversity as such results in higher productivity  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:01):**  of the ecosystem.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:03):**  So you can say, okay, this tree is growing fastest.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:06):**  But if you combine, if you have a given diversity of species, then the system as a whole has  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:12):**  a higher overall average productivity.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:16):**  So those are then the aspects that you can show and bring on the table already now.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:22):**  I want to be conscious of your time obviously and ask a few final questions to the three  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:26):**  of you.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:27):**  If there would be one thing you could change overnight, you have a magic wand, you go to  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:32):**  the garden and say, I'm going to change X in the agriculture, land use, restoration  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:38):**  industry space.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:39):**  What would it be?  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:40):**  Where would we wake up tomorrow morning and we'll see what you have changed?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:43):**  You can think about it if you want, if you have something.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:45):**  What you need now is to know where you can work, where you can plant essentially, where  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:54):**  you can and are allowed to change the ecosystems.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:38:58):**  I think that's also a major operational hurdle, where is the soil, where is the area available  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:04):**  to work on?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:06):**  I think that's an operational hurdle to connect to people and to see where the purchase can  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:12):**  start.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:13):**  So a list of landowners open to restoration would be very, very helpful.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:20):**  Yes, at the scale of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of hectares.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:26):**  That is really important then to get to the operational phase at that stage, at that scale.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:35):**  I'm going to ask the same question to Harry, obviously.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:38):**  I really would like to see trees in purpose for mitigation of climate change, because  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:43):**  that's what's really needed to address at the moment.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:47):**  It's a serious problem and we have to move fast.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:50):**  That's what we're after in this company.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:39:53):**  And to do that, because I think a lot of people are getting on trees against climate change,  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:00):**  the bandwagon.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:02):**  What would you see, what would you hope, would you like everyone to be on that boat?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:06):**  Would you like every landowner to start planting?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:09):**  Would you like to have a special type of tree that grows faster and stores more carbon?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:12):**  What's your magic computer that answers all your questions?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:16):**  Well, different planting should give that answer.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:18):**  But clearly, like Kun mentioned, we have to look into biodiversity and there's no one  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:22):**  single bullet or not one single tree which can do the trick.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:26):**  But we have to get community involvement here that everybody realizes the necessity of carbon  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:33):**  sequestration.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:34):**  And Arno, the same question for you.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:37):**  What would you change overnight if you had all the power?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:41):**  I have the most boring answer, but it would be on the policy side.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:44):**  So there's a lot being done on conservation.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:47):**  The UN does a lot.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:49):**  But for a project like ours to replant trees, to plant trees, so reforestation and afforestation,  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:56):**  there's not a lot of policy around it.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:40:58):**  And it's difficult to see the direct benefits.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:02):**  There's huge benefits that we've listed a lot of here, but financially, it's still a  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:07):**  stretch.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:08):**  But if we would be able to, for instance, CO2 credits, if you could get ex ante instead  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:13):**  of ex post credits, and it's being worked on.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:17):**  But the EU, for instance, it's difficult to on the certification side to make that happen.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:23):**  That would be a real boost for not only land life company, but a lot of companies and potential  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:29):**  companies that are trying to start up in this space to be able to do a lot more of these

**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:52):**  being cut, a lot of mining being done.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:41:55):**  There's not a lot of trees being planted back.

**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:05):**  to tree planting compared to tree cutting down.

**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:11):**  But the area that we are starting up in, and we don't have a lot of competitors, I would  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:16):**  welcome more and more policy to make that possible to plant more trees.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:22):**  And the final question as the audience, let's imagine there's a theatre full of active impact  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:27):**  investors that are on the tree bandwagon, they're on regenerative agriculture and food  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:32):**  and soil restoration.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:34):**  What would be, obviously, without giving investment advice, what would be a place to start?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:39):**  Which book should they read, which documentary should they do, which place should they visit  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:43):**  to start thinking about how to put their money to work, which could be quite a lot, could  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:48):**  be a bit less, but most of us are also investors through our local banks, etc.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:54):**  Where would you start your journey if you're interested in reforestation and the restoration  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:58):**  industry?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:42:59):**  Well, it's a good question.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:01):**  And as I said, when we started the company, we were not struggling, but debating, do  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:07):**  we become a foundation?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:08):**  Do we become a stichting in Dutch or do we become a private company?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:12):**  And what is the business model?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:15):**  And as I said, we moved from making a product towards an end-to-end restoration.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:19):**  So it's a good and difficult question to answer.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:24):**  The easier part is where to look to see these kinds of things happening.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:29):**  Always I think from satellite imagery is the Dominican Republic in Haiti.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:33):**  The amount of deforestation done in the west side of the island is unbelievable.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:38):**  And from space you just see and all the erosion and water damage that happens there compared  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:43):**  to the Dominican Republic is amazing.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:46):**  But there's, I mean, mining sites all over the world where you can see what deforestation  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:49):**  does and timber, which is not controlled.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:51):**  So I don't think the public can imagine what the impact is, but I would say try to imagine  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:43:57):**  what the other side of that impact is.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:00):**  If you go from brown to green, if you have a brown piece of land and you plant trees  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:06):**  there, you do it in a smart way, what that looks like in five or ten years.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:11):**  And that is something that is now doable.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:13):**  It's possible.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:14):**  The technology is there to do this.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:16):**  So it will become an industry, what we're operating in, and it will become monetizable,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:22):**  if that's even a word.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:23):**  But it's, I mean, cities now in the US put amounts of money on trees in their streets  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:29):**  from a shade perspective, not having to use the air conditioning, the beautification.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:35):**  And it's always a difficult debate.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:36):**  Is it $500 this oak or $250?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:39):**  But that is becoming more and more commonplace.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:41):**  And I think the same will happen in nature restoration and just the amount that the bills  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:46):**  that countries have to pay for hurricane damage, erosion damage is becoming huge and insurance  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:51):**  companies are jumping into it.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:53):**  So I think this is becoming an industry and it's becoming a money making industry and  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:44:58):**  really money making for good.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:01):**  It's not just profit for profit.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:02):**  It's making profit off of trees.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:04):**  And I think in a few years, this will be an investable business.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:07):**  And exactly what shape or form, I don't know, but I have the feeling that that's going to  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:11):**  happen.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:12):**  So definitely keep it on your radar.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:14):**  And going back to the gentleman on the other side of the table, any ideas, books to read,  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:21):**  documentaries to watch, places to visit, if you are an active impact investor?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:27):**  Because you have seen many places, Harry, I know where to go to get the best sense.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:32):**  But I do think it is seeing places.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:35):**  It is really the thing.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:37):**  I mean, as an investor or as any person, it is really to do in many, many places.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:44):**  If you go to Africa, which has deforested where the soil goes into the air, where you  
**[0:45:50-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:50):**  see the impact of human there and the consequences of human society, then you really understand  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:45:58):**  that something needs to be done there.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:01):**  And I also am convinced that there is a return on investment there.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:06):**  If you put it there, it's on the long term.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:08):**  But if you bring in money and the consequences of return over a longer time, I'm sure that  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:14):**  that will be brought back to you.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:17):**  But looking at those sites and what happened there and what are the potential consequences  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:23):**  of not acting, I think that is really touch and feel.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:29):**  And then it brings into you, not in the reports.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:32):**  And with that, I would like to thank you.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:33):**  The three of you, it's the first time we do a live podcast with four people.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:38):**  And I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:39):**  I'm definitely going to check in in a year or two years in the software.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:43):**  And obviously on the planting in the hundreds of thousands of trees that you're planting  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:46):**  actually this year as well.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:48):**  So I will link a lot of the research and the things and links we've mentioned below.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:46:52):**  And I want to thank you all for your time today.

**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:47:03):**  millions and millions of productive trees.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:47:06):**  It won't be easy, but it's absolutely crucial.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/#t=0:47:09):**  If you found the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast valuable, there

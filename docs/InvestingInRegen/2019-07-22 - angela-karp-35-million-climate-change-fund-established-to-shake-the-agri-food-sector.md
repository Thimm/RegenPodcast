### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:30:04)
## Angela Karp, £3.5 million climate change fund established to shake the agri-food sector  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to a new short episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:04):**  Today I'm talking to Professor Angela Karp,  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:06):**  Director for Science Innovation Engagement and Partnerships at Rossamstad Research.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:11):**  We will talk about the Shake Climate Change Program,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:14):**  a £3.5 million climate change fund established to shake the agri-food sector  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:19):**  and make, and I really love this, agriculture part of the solution.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture,  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:28):**  Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:30):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:35):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:39):**  people, local communities and ecosystems, while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:47):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:49):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:53):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:00:57):**  start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:03):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:07):**  and I will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:11):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:14):**  there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:19):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:23):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:27):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:31):**  I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:34):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:39):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:44):**  Welcome Angela.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:45):**  Hello.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:46):**  And so I had the great pleasure of visiting the facility, I think about a month ago,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:51):**  and saw a bit more background of what's been happening in your research facility,  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:55):**  focusing on soil.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:01:56):**  But for the people who haven't done that or haven't come across your work and your name,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:00):**  what is Rothensted Research?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:02):**  So, Rothensted Research is a research station that's been, for the last 175 years,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:09):**  been studying agricultural sciences.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:12):**  We were founded by someone who was really interested in how to improve soils for crops  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:18):**  and crop production and discovered superphosphate fertilizers.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:23):**  And since then, we've been working on agriculture,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:26):**  and particularly towards sustainable agricultural systems.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:30):**  And this is quite a big step, what you've announced very recently,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:34):**  is the Shake Climate Change Program.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:36):**  Can you explain in a few words, I mean, there's a lot behind it,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:39):**  but why you're so happy you're making this step to an accelerator and a fund  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:43):**  and to really go to the entrepreneurial side of things?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:46):**  I think it's a very exciting moment because we know that the clock is ticking  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:50):**  and that we need to find solutions to climate change as quickly as possible.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:02:56):**  So, what's exciting about this program is it brings together the robustness  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:00):**  and the historical background of science,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:02):**  but into an arena where you have entrepreneurial thinking.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:06):**  And that will bring a speed and acceleration and sort of energy  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:10):**  and new ways of thinking that scientists don't necessarily bring.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:15):**  But the advantage is that when those new ideas come from the entrepreneurs,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:20):**  we have the technologies, the scientific expertise,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:23):**  and the whole pool of experts around us here to help test them rigorously.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:28):**  So what they're developing can be, you know, the sort of proof of concept stage  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:33):**  can be quickly evolved into something that we can,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:36):**  we know is going to really work when it goes out there.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:40):**  And I mean, I love that making agriculture part of the program,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:44):**  making agriculture part of the solution,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:45):**  I think it's why we're all excited about the sector,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:47):**  because it's one of those sectors where you not only have a huge negative impact  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:53):**  at the moment, but a huge potential to have a positive impact.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:56):**  And I think it's absolutely crucial.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:57):**  There's more attention for that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:03:59):**  So can you explain a bit what the program entails?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:01):**  What an entrepreneur maybe listening to this podcast,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:04):**  what he or she as a team or he or she as a person can see coming if they would apply?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:10):**  Sure. So the program is supported by a consortium that involves  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:15):**  Rothernsted, Cranfield University, University College London,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:18):**  and University of Hertfordshire.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:22):**  And we are all aware of some very powerful technologies  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:26):**  that could be brought to the fore here to help agriculture become part of the solution  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:32):**  and not just the problem, which is often what it seemed to be at the moment.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:36):**  So we know that agricultural practices result in emissions of greenhouse gases,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:42):**  release carbon from the soil and so on.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:46):**  But if you look at there are many steps in the agricultural process  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:50):**  where we could introduce new innovations, which would actually turn that right around.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:04:55):**  It could be in the soil practices, it could be in storage, it could be around transport,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:00):**  it could be novel ways of actually cultivating, for example, new machinery,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:05):**  there's lots of areas where new thinking could actually turn around this whole business  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:12):**  from being a cost, if you like, to the environment,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:15):**  to something which is actually helping us solve climate change.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:19):**  And the research center, I mean, I've seen that there's one room,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:22):**  actually there are multiple, I've seen one of them,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:25):**  where you can basically go back 175 years of soil samples,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:28):**  because you have to be doing research on the same estate of land basically for the last 175 years.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:34):**  What kind of value does that bring to or what kind of interest does it bring to entrepreneurs  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:40):**  that they can go back so far in time and see if certain things would have helped or worked,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:45):**  or how would that help entrepreneurs applying for the program?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:49):**  It's hugely helpful because we are able to cast out our look backwards in time,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:05:55):**  which helps us actually predict how things may have an impact going forwards in time.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:01):**  Because by looking backwards, we can see how agricultural systems have responded to interventions  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:08):**  in the past, to changes in the environment in the past, and how indeed agricultural practices have  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:15):**  resulted in changes in the environment around them in the past.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:20):**  So all of that can be brought to the front in terms of predicting what a new innovation  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:27):**  might mean in the future.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:29):**  We can use a lot of that data in modeling, in scenario building, and indeed we have  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:36):**  testing environments here on site.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:39):**  So for example, we have areas of land which have not had any cultivation for very long periods of time.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:46):**  We have areas that have been left fallow and then converted into grass or converted into crops.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:06:53):**  So we have many variations of testing environments in which new innovations could be tried out on.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:02):**  So for example, someone has a sensor probe, a new technique, has a way of applying a new process.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:09):**  We have a whole pile of experimental areas in which that could be tested out.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:15):**  And then our partners, for example, at Cranfield, they have other testing facilities.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:19):**  So do UCL.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:21):**  So in fact, and Harvard here, between us, we can enable entrepreneurs to use our data,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:28):**  regain from our understanding of agricultural systems, which is deeply rooted in a profound  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:35):**  understanding of agriculture, and go out and experiment and try out their innovations on the  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:42):**  farm, in fields, and in laboratory conditions, or using equipment, which is really geared  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:48):**  towards answering those types of issues.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:51):**  And I mean, you have basically an opportunity to test in a moderate climate.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:57):**  I mean, you're in the UK.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:07:58):**  Does that mean the potential applicants have to be from the UK?  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:03):**  Or what does that mean for innovations?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:05):**  Do they have to be focused on that type of farms that you can find in the UK?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:10):**  Or how does it work?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:12):**  So at least the foundation that's behind the funding for this,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:16):**  would like to see the innovations being developed and tested in the UK.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:22):**  We would like entrepreneurs, ventures to be based here for the period of time to demonstrate  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:28):**  how an impact could be had from their idea in the UK.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:34):**  But of course, that doesn't preclude the fact that it could have relevance globally.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:40):**  But we couldn't be supporting something that would be hugely specialized, say, for a  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:45):**  only African or sub-Saharan African areas.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:49):**  The focus would initially have to be on the UK agricultural systems.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:53):**  Yeah, that's clear.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:54):**  And obviously, the foundation that's behind that has a very strong roots in the UK.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:08:59):**  So it's an easy one in that sense.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:01):**  And there's a lot to do, obviously, in moderate climates.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:03):**  And if you look throughout Europe, I mean, there's an incredible need for this kind of innovations.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:08):**  And what does the program offer me as an entrepreneur?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:11):**  What are the faces?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:12):**  What do I need to do?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:13):**  What are the faces? What do I have to prepare for?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:16):**  What do I get when I want to apply?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:18):**  So the program is structured around four phases.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:23):**  And I think there are two ways in which it is quite different from many other accelerated programs.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:31):**  One way is that it's partially tailored in the sense that in some of the phases,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:38):**  we very much look at what the venture needs.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:41):**  And we draw from a pool of experts in order to make sure each individual entrepreneur  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:48):**  has the skill base that supporting them that's suitable for that innovation.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:54):**  So if I just talk you through those steps, you'll see that it becomes increasingly like that  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:09:59):**  as we go down the phases.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:01):**  So in phase one, it's a four day workshop where about 30 entrepreneurs will be invited.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:08):**  And we'll be working with them in a very quite intense program,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:13):**  helping them build up their ideas and then pitching to a group who will select them to move into the next phase.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:21):**  But we aim that by the end of those four days, all of those entrepreneurs will have benefited from being there.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:28):**  That they will have taken their ideas and built much better ideas by the end of the four days.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:34):**  And even if they don't make it into the next phase,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:36):**  they'll have had some gain from being part of that.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:39):**  And we'll also be trying to refer them to other programs where they may be able to take their ideas  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:44):**  if they're not successful in moving into the next phase.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:48):**  Bearing in mind that one of the big criteria will be what will be the impact on climate change.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:53):**  So it's not just about how viable that idea might be.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:10:58):**  In the second, so the first phase, I said it's 34 days, but in the second phase,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:02):**  we're running it over about two months.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:04):**  Two and a half months.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:06):**  And then there'll be some structured days of learning where, for example, an entrepreneur will come  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:13):**  and in the morning they might have a presentation and that could be anything from agri-tech, farming.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:18):**  It could be about financing, markets.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:22):**  It could be about risk or investment or how to build a good team.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:26):**  And they'll have some action learning associated with that.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:30):**  And then in the afternoon, mentors will sit down and work with them and work on an individual basis  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:36):**  and say, okay, how are you going to adopt that learning and take it up  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:40):**  and improve your business as a result of it?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:43):**  We will also have a look at the ventures that make it into phase two.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:48):**  And we will tailor some very specific learning for some of them, depending on what they need.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:54):**  So let, for example, let's suppose that one of them is working specifically in the field.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:11:59):**  And they're the only venture that is working in the livestock area.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:02):**  There's no necessarily point taking everyone onto a livestock farm or into some livestock experts,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:08):**  but we would try to organize that for that venture.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:11):**  So they get a real opportunity to talk to customers in that space, to test something out,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:17):**  to listen and understand what's going on in that sector.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:21):**  So in those two to three months, it will be a mix of structured and tailored learning  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:26):**  with the aim of trying to maximize the chance of every one of those 10 ventures  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:31):**  really improving their idea and their business idea, going out, talking to customers,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:35):**  testing it in different environments and really sort of soundproofing it with the sector  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:42):**  and almost being challenged by experts in the science so that they know that by the end of it all,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:48):**  where their weaknesses are, what they need to build on, who to go to if they need help,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:53):**  and they're in the best possible space at the end of that two to three months.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:12:58):**  They will then pitch to an investment panel who will choose about five,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:02):**  and those five will receive a seed fund of up to 140,000 with which to go forward then  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:10):**  and develop their venture.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:12):**  And here we are a bit different from other accelerators because we have then a prolonged aftercare  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:18):**  because we're aware that for many entrepreneurs, it's when you scale up and try to then move on  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:23):**  that often big problems arise.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:26):**  And we tend to provide them with the support so that if those problems are there,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:31):**  they'll always have a mentor.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:33):**  We can always bring in an expert.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:35):**  We even will keep a contingency fund should they need to pivot and do something else.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:40):**  And that prolonged aftercare, we will help them and mentor them and try to help them get the  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:44):**  investment they need to then move on and if you like move out of the program because they've  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:50):**  become so successful, they've been able to attract significant investment and move forward  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:57):**  by themselves.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:13:58):**  So that's the program that we have.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:02):**  So phase one is the intense course, phase two is the tailored structured learning,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:06):**  phase three is this period of aftercare, and then phase four, they move on to the next  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:13):**  phase.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:15):**  Phase four, they move out of the program, hopefully with great investment behind them,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:20):**  but we would ask them to become part of our alumni.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:24):**  So you will never lose them completely.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:25):**  They can always benefit from our ecosystem should they need it.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:29):**  It sounds extremely interesting, especially for companies or ideas or teams that are in  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:35):**  that early early stage phase and that need a lot of structuring a lot of very practical  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:40):**  decisions to make where their company is going to go in an extended 15, 20, 30 years as anybody  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:46):**  working in this space probably knows it's a long term game.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:50):**  We're playing long term games here, meaning that the beginning is so crucial as you have  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:54):**  to make some some very important decisions and you can get you can use all the help that's  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:14:59):**  out there basically.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:01):**  And we're also aware that the agri agri tech sector, you know, it's not necessarily going  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:06):**  to be quick and easy wins.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:09):**  It might be that you need to do field trials, for example, and you might only be able to  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:13):**  do one every year.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:15):**  So it's not it's not like working in, you know, other sectors where you can turn things  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:21):**  around necessarily really quickly.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:24):**  So we need to be there supporting them in those longer journeys, as well as some of  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:28):**  the the shorter, quicker wins, which, you know, a lot of people go for because they  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:34):**  can see a faster return.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:36):**  In agriculture, it is not necessarily going to be like that.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:40):**  And we're trying to change agriculture around what we're hoping for as a result of this

**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:52):**  People will be doing things differently, we hope, as a result of this programme, which  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:15:57):**  is going to, as we say, make agriculture part of the solution.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:16:02):**  And I will definitely link all the information below with all the questions also around the  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:16:06):**  convertible loan and how you invest and if you can apply and how you can apply.

**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/20/angela-karp/#t=0:16:26):**  time.

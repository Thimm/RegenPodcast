**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:13):**  What is the role of science and scientists in the regenerative agriculture revolution  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:17):**  and why are there so few peer-reviewed papers on Regen-ec?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:21):**  Why does it seem like advanced regenerative farmers are doing things which are absolutely  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:25):**  impossible according to traditional academia?  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:28):**  In this interview we dive deep into these topics and what to do about it.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:38):**  if the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:42):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:47):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:00:56):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:07):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:11):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:16):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:18):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:37):**  Today on the podcast we have an agroecologist, entomologist, farmer and beekeeper.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:41):**  He's the director of non-profit Regenerative Agriculture Research Center, the Egg Dices  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:46):**  Foundation, cutting edge research for transforming agriculture with regenerative principles and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:51):**  the owner of Blue Dasher Farm in South Dakota.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome Dr. Jonathan Lentgen.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:55):**  Hi, how are you?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:01:57):**  Very well and to ask you a personal question, why soil of all the things you could be doing?  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:03):**  You know I never saw myself as a soil guy.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:06):**  In fact I probably bucked against it for many many years.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:09):**  I was an entomologist and I was supposed to focus on insects and insects aren't soil.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:15):**  But it became real clear over time that all the soil scientists down the hallway from  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:20):**  me at the USDA, everything that I was doing was being affected by them and everything  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:25):**  that they were doing was being affected by my study group.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:28):**  And it became clear that we're at a phase in agricultural science where these discipline  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:34):**  specific sorts of questions that have driven agricultural science for so long, I think  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:40):**  that they're less relevant now.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:42):**  We need to figure out where all of our little sub-disciplines fit within the grander system.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:48):**  So entomology became agroecology.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:50):**  Who'd have thought?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:52):**  And then you left the USDA and you set up the foundation, you set up a farm.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:02:56):**  Can you describe a bit the different pieces there and how they interlink?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:00):**  Yeah so we have everything that the farmers were doing in this regenerative sphere was  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:07):**  really spectacular.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:08):**  I mean and they were doing things that's a science that couldn't happen right?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:12):**  Do you have an example?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:13):**  Yeah I mean growing cover crops in arid regions or in areas with short growing seasons.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:19):**  They were going no-till where oh no if you do that you're going to lose everything.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:24):**  They were diversifying their crop rotations, they were integrating animals into these systems.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:29):**  It's like every time we've done this scientific study on this research farm and everything  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:35):**  was controlled and it was like we totally missed the boat.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:39):**  These farmers had developed systems that were very successful but they were thinking about  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:44):**  it as a system rather than a component research.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:48):**  Anyways so I saw that this is the future of food production right?  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:52):**  So I tried to change the system from within the federal government.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:03:57):**  I was given an award by President Obama for being one of the top scientists in the country.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:03):**  Thought I had some political clout out there, thought I could make some changes.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:07):**  Big ships are hard to turn and so I ended up quitting.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:11):**  I said you know this isn't going to come from the government, this isn't going to come from  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:15):**  large universities, this is going to come from the grassroots and it's already happening.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:21):**  And science to support it needs to come from the grassroots too and we need to really yes  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:27):**  we need to rethink our food production systems but we also need to rethink a lot of the associated  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:33):**  aspects of society that are accompanying that change in our food system.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:39):**  And science is certainly one of those and that's kind of what we're really interested  
**[0:04:43-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:43):**  in focusing on is how we conduct agricultural science from this sort of paradigm shift perspective.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:53):**  Macroevolutionary scale is what we're talking about.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:04:56):**  These little microevolutionary steps and incremental steps in science.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:02):**  So what we did is we created Nick Dice's foundation, Blue Dasher Farm.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:07):**  We're revolutionizing how science is being done in order to drive a revolution in agriculture.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:14):**  Yeah there's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:16):**  You mentioned you believe region ag is the future of food production.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:20):**  Do you remember was there one specific moment that you I don't know a light bulb moment  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:24):**  was it over the years you remember when that really clicked?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:29):**  Well just interacting with farmers and beekeepers.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:32):**  So ranchers, farmers, beekeepers, these guys were doing things that I had never seen before  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:38):**  and that I was taught couldn't be done.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:40):**  They were growing traditional crops but they didn't have insect pests and so I said well  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:45):**  what's your pest management regime and they said we don't have one we don't have pests.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:51):**  And I said no no that's not supposed to happen right.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:54):**  Your pests are inevitable.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:56):**  You can't get away from these things.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:05:58):**  And they said no if you design your system right you don't have these problems.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:03):**  And I'm like okay.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:04):**  Seeing is believing just as much for scientists as it is for farmers which is a real problem  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:10):**  with our current scientific infrastructure because how often do scientists actually go  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:14):**  out to the field anymore.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:16):**  I went out to their operations what they said was true.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:19):**  So guys like Gail Fuller and Gabe Brown and more locally even with farmers that were doing  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:25):**  some spectacular things.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:27):**  For me that was the turning point.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:29):**  It's like I can't go back to supporting a broken system like this anymore.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:34):**  I need to use my research and what skills I have for the future and the future is regenerative  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:40):**  ag.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:41):**  And you decided to not only set up a foundation but also a farm.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:45):**  Can you explain a bit the work of the foundation of this macro revolution you called it and  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:50):**  why there's a farm and a foundation and what's your work your focus currently in terms of  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:06:55):**  getting the academic world to the regenerative agriculture world or the other way around.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:00):**  Yeah so what we've said is one of the central problems is that we're evaluating scientists  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:05):**  based on a cluster of metrics that separate us from the people that we're trying to help.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:12):**  Why do we feel success is related to whether or not you jump to mid management level versus  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:18):**  being in a cubicle for your whole career.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:21):**  What the hell does that mean.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:22):**  What a pointless thing right.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:23):**  What it means something to you when you're in that system.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:26):**  And that's the same thing that's what happened in science.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:28):**  I mean we were evaluated based on how many scientific publications that you get in the  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:34):**  peer reviewed literature which is great but if they're impenetrable to normal people that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:40):**  you're trying to help how many grant dollars you've gotten you know how many millions in  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:45):**  competitive grants how many students graduate students you pump through the puppy mill in  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:51):**  order to turn them off.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:53):**  And none of this is helping farmers obviously.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:07:55):**  On that list of things that we were assessing ourselves by what do farmers care about.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:01):**  None of them right.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:02):**  None of them.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:03):**  But the only way that you get a job in science is by adhering to that current bureaucracy.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:09):**  And so it's agricultural science is just in the self perpetuating rut.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:14):**  We can't get out.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:15):**  And so the first step in the process is it's like well you know I mean we've got some scientific  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:20):**  credibility we've worked within that system we've demonstrated that we know it and are  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:24):**  good at it.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:25):**  Now I'm going to quit and I'm going to start something totally different and hopefully  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:30):**  we can make some serious changes.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:33):**  So the first step in that process is that the scientists have to become far.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:37):**  We have to walk a mile in their shoes because right now the scientific questions that we're  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:42):**  asking that are supporting a broken agricultural system are too often they're completely disconnected  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:49):**  from the kinds of questions that need to be answered from a practical perspective.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:54):**  So your farm is in South Dakota.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:56):**  Can you describe it a bit.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:57):**  What are you farming.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:08:58):**  Well what we did with Blue Dasher is we took the rule book we looked at it and then we  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:02):**  threw it out the window.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:04):**  The traditional rule book.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:06):**  Right.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:07):**  At this point it's small but it's got a lot of enterprises stacked on top of each other.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:14):**  And that's what I think our regenerative farm is supposed to do is have those enterprises  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:19):**  integrated vertically.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:21):**  So what do we do.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:22):**  We raise sheep.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:23):**  We raise honey.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:25):**  We raise prairie.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:26):**  We raise wetlands.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:28):**  We raise chickens for meat and egg production.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:32):**  We're looking at other forms of meat production here that we can integrate in.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:36):**  We have an orchard for perennial fruit production.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:41):**  And then we also have both annual and perennial field crops that are kind of all integrated  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:47):**  in with a native unbroken prairie which if your listeners have never experienced the  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:53):**  prairie that used to range across North America it's a real gem.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:09:57):**  And there isn't many little pockets like Blue Dasher farm left anymore.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:01):**  Less than one percent.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:03):**  Wow.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:04):**  And then how does it connect to the academic because you could have just started adjust  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:08):**  between brackets.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:09):**  You could have just started a farm and say OK I've seen the experience of many of the  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:14):**  farmers.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:15):**  It seems to make a lot of sense.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:16):**  I put my academic hat on the wall and that's it and I will just become a farmer and step  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:21):**  away from the academic world.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:22):**  But you did it.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:23):**  Right.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:24):**  And there's a lot of days sometimes I wish I could pick one hat to wear but I don't.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:28):**  So the research facility is right here on Blue Dasher farm and we have a scientific  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:33):**  staff that's located here.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:35):**  This is the first in what is becoming a national network of these centers for regenerative  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:41):**  agriculture research.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:43):**  So we're looking at expanding into Colorado and California in the next year maybe Iowa  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:49):**  and just starting to extend our reach.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:51):**  The whole idea is that something that's missing.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:54):**  Well what we would like these to be is sort of the scientists have to become a part of  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:10:58):**  the agricultural community again not in some ivory tower but actually a place of learning  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:04):**  where people can go and be a part of it and then we can also be a part of that community  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:09):**  where we get to know the farmers in our region and help them directly with their problems.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:14):**  And what are some of the problems you've been tackling at the farm?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:18):**  How to manage vegetation without tillage or agrochemicals.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:23):**  So we're farming our annual crops directly into perennial warm season grasses which is  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:28):**  again one of those rules that we threw out the window and now we have to figure out okay  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:32):**  why do we do what we do and how do we make it work.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:35):**  So we're using two tools that are really well adapted to our environment which are fire  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:40):**  and grazing and of course vegetation competition in order to control vegetation not eradicate  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:48):**  it like which is often the goal of vegetation management but rather how do we push it down  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:11:55):**  at key points to allow us to take our revenue earning crop off of the field.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:01):**  And you mentioned it was small the farm.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:03):**  What's the size which should we imagine as this?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:05):**  53 acres but half of that is unbroken prairie and wetlands and we're working with those.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:11):**  As an integrated system.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:14):**  And in terms of research to bring it up you published a number of papers or you published  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:18):**  a paper where we connected over in 2018 if I'm not mistaken focused on the profitability  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:24):**  of regenerative farmers versus non-regenerative farmers which is one of the few studies I  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:28):**  know that actually came up please let me know in the comments if you know of any others  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:33):**  that really connected that profitability which obviously all investors but also all farmers  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:39):**  always talk about.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:40):**  Can you describe a bit the background of that study and then we get into the results?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:45):**  Well we received a research grant to study cover crops and their effects on insects.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:51):**  It was a meant to be an on-farm study so we went out and we talked with some of these  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:12:56):**  regenerative farmers I don't know that they knew they were regenerative farmers at the  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:00):**  time because that word really wasn't floating around much in the US yet.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:04):**  How did they call themselves?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:05):**  Soil farmers?  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:06):**  How did you connect to them?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:07):**  I don't know.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:08):**  I don't know.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:09):**  I mean they were they were no-tillers, covercroppers you know that kind of stuff but regen really  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:16):**  became a thing and people rallied behind that term for sure.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:22):**  Okay so we said okay well you guys are the leaders we want to learn from you.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:27):**  You guys have an amazing farm in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska which is  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:32):**  kind of a heart of this transition zone between corn soybean land and rangelands and they  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:39):**  said yeah yeah we want to participate and so we said okay great well we're the scientists  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:44):**  and so we're gonna come out there and what you want to do then if you're gonna participate  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:48):**  is you have to have you're gonna plant this cover crop at this particular time and you're  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:52):**  going to have four replicative plots and then you're gonna leave half of those without them.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:56):**  I would have loved to see their faces.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:13:58):**  And they're like what the hell is this?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:00):**  What are you talking about?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:02):**  We don't use Roundup.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:03):**  We can't use that.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:04):**  What species of cover crop are you talking about?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:07):**  I mean do you want us to and when do you want us to sow that one and I'm like okay this  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:11):**  is getting this is a cluster you know I mean this is where this is a total nightmare.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:16):**  It's falling apart but what was really falling apart is that those guys were leading this  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:21):**  cover crop charge at the time and we were losing what was special about their farm and  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:27):**  so that's when I changed the whole focus of our research program.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:31):**  It's like what we're doing is wrong.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:33):**  We're losing what's special about these farmers and these farmers are the actual leaders not  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:38):**  the scientists and so what we've said is we said farmer point us to the corn phase of  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:44):**  your rotation and we'd like to study that and they said okay that's no trouble and then  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:49):**  we said okay point us to your the corn phase of your neighbor who's a conventional farmer  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:55):**  who's been successful at that conventional farm.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:14:58):**  They said no problem and so we went and we studied those and we got a totally different  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:03):**  picture of anything that anybody's ever demonstrated within I think the peer-reviewed literature.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:10):**  We got a systems level study with best management practices that were defined by successful  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:17):**  farming operations as opposed to what scientists have defined as best management practices  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:24):**  in a laboratory or on a research farm and then it's got a regional focus instead of  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:30):**  just one little pocket.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:32):**  So that model of study is kind of a part of this whole idea of how it is that we approach  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:40):**  agricultural science where we need to be considering these systems and how do you define those  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:45):**  systems also becomes a real challenge because it's not traditionally done very well.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:51):**  Everything has to be very controlled so we're losing the relevance by controlling everything  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:56):**  in our scientific questions.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:15:58):**  We're gonna unpack that piece a bit but what were the outcome, a few of the outcomes that  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:03):**  would say what surprised you the most?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:06):**  I mean you've seen a lot of things prior to that study but what would be a few of the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:11):**  big surprises coming out of, apart from the fact that you get to change your whole setup  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:15):**  of your study but it was probably a humbling experience.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:18):**  Right.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:19):**  The number one insect pests were 10 times more abundant in the insecticide treated corn  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:25):**  fields.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:26):**  And that wasn't supposed to happen.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:28):**  No, because they were treated.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:30):**  Right, right, right.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:31):**  That's why we buy this stuff.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:32):**  It's a good investment, right?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:34):**  Ten times, not even 10% or ten fold more abundant of insecticide.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:39):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:40):**  I mean similar numbers in other cropping systems now.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:45):**  It's just like, it's a total fallacy.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:48):**  Everything that we learned about integrated pest management, it was doomed to fail from  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:53):**  the beginning when it was conceived back in 1959.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:16:56):**  It was doomed to fail because what it said was, went into IPM, which is the way that  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:02):**  people apply pesticides and things like that.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:06):**  They said, here's a broken system that's going to have pests and here's how to manage them  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:12):**  better.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:14):**  And what they should have been asking is why are there pests to begin with?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:18):**  And that's what these farmers did on these regenerative corn fields.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:22):**  Another thing that was pretty surprising is that the yields were uncorrelated with profit.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:28):**  And this is something that we've been suspecting for quite some time.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:33):**  Farmers don't have a business plan.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:36):**  There's no business plan on most farms in the US.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:39):**  No, they only talk about yields.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:40):**  They only talk about yields.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:41):**  I mean, they're regenerative guys and girls definitely talk about margins and profits,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:45):**  et cetera, because they're comfortable with that.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:48):**  But it always surprised me, as somebody that doesn't come from farming, like you would  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:51):**  never ask the question, I've probably said it a million times on this podcast, to a factory,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:17:55):**  like what's the maximum you can squeeze out of in terms of bicycles or in terms of phones?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:00):**  Now you would ask, what's the optimal in terms of costs, input, output to see?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:04):**  I mean, you're not going to do 24 hour shifts if it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:07):**  You're not going to input, et cetera.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:09):**  But somehow in farms, we only ask, what's your yield?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:12):**  That's it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah, that's crazy.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:14):**  And down at the coffee shop, too.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:15):**  I mean, nobody's talking about.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:17):**  Of course.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:18):**  Yeah, that's the one thing we compare.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:20):**  But they weren't correlated.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:21):**  So what's going on there?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:24):**  Well, what my conclusion is, you can grow 300 bushel corn if you really want to, but  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:31):**  it's going to take a lot of input costs.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:33):**  And that's not good farming.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:35):**  It's really poor farming, but you still have the best yields in the county.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:40):**  And that's what matters to the farmer.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:43):**  Again, what metrics are we assessing our success by within these different fields?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah, I said something like the regenerative fields, and I would like to touch upon that  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:51):**  a bit later, had a 29 percent lower grain production, but 78 percent higher profits  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:57):**  over traditional corn production systems.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:18:59):**  That's again, significant, a lot, et cetera.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:02):**  But at 29 percent, because I hear some people now saying we're actually approaching, like  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:08):**  we're outperforming, approaching, even if you just look at corn, et cetera, on some  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:11):**  regenerative fields.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:12):**  Do you see that, too?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:14):**  Is this because we looked at part of the system and not that they're holistic?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:17):**  Does this include the grazing that they might do afterwards as well?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:20):**  How should we look at the 29 and not be scared?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:22):**  OK, it's almost 30 percent less.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:23):**  How are we going to feed the world?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:25):**  Which is something we hear all the time, obviously.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:27):**  Yeah, I mean, right now, 67 percent, I think something like this of the arable land in  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:34):**  North America is devoted to crops we don't eat.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:37):**  So if you want to feed the world, grow food.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:41):**  It looks pretty simple.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:44):**  Number two, you know, I mean, hunger is not correlated to how much corn we're producing.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:50):**  If there's hunger issues around the world, it's either a distribution problem or we're  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:56):**  producing the wrong kind of thing.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:19:58):**  So you're saying the 29 percent less is not something to be frightened about or to go  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:03):**  into some kind of, oh.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:04):**  No, no.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:05):**  And then the last thing on that is some of the top yielding farms in this study were  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:12):**  the regenerative farms.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:13):**  So it's possible.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:14):**  It doesn't have to be.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:15):**  But that's not their metric of what they're optimizing for.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:19):**  I think that's true.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:20):**  I mean, they're focusing on the profitability of their operation.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:24):**  But it's also true that we're on the front edge of a movement right now.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:29):**  And there's a lot more variability in yields and production.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:33):**  How many farmers were there in that study?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:36):**  Twenty or something like that.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:38):**  I'd have to go back and think about it.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:41):**  But not 200.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, it's definitely right.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:44):**  It was one of the first studies.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:46):**  And it's still the only one I've seen at this level and the system level.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:50):**  You were mentioning some other you're working on some others.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:52):**  Can you share a bit on that?  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:55):**  Our strategy at Ecdysis is, I mean, we're trying to change the world to regenerative  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:20:59):**  food production using science as much as we can.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:02):**  And part of our strategy is to find key systems, food systems around the country that can have  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:08):**  knock on benefits or affect sort of agricultural communities.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:13):**  And so we're working, we did the corn study that you're referring to.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:17):**  We're working in rangelands in the southeastern US and rangelands up in the northern plains  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:22):**  of the US and Canada.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:24):**  We're working on cash grain systems through from Manitoba all the way down to Kansas.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:30):**  And how did you pick those?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:31):**  Because they are large acreage, because huge issues?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:34):**  What's the framework to decide?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:36):**  So we look at what are some of the dominant crops that can either profit wise or acres  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:42):**  wise in a particular region.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:45):**  And the hope is that when we turn that crop, that the rest of the fantasy is that.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:52):**  And when you say region, is that bioregional watershed?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:55):**  What's the...  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:56):**  Eco regions, I guess.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:21:57):**  So the goal is to, I mean, we divided the US into a certain number of these eco regions  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:04):**  based on climate, based on rainfall, temperature, and then growing conditions more or less.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:11):**  And then markets, but they probably drive a lot of those as well.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:15):**  Almonds in California would be another example.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:18):**  And that one we're just wrapping up.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:20):**  That would be interesting.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:22):**  And that's coming?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:24):**  So that one's going to change California agriculture, fundamentally change it.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:27):**  And agriculture in California is, that's one of the biggest agricultural states in the  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:32):**  US in terms of financially.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:35):**  And probably the world by itself.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:36):**  I'll bet you're right.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:39):**  I know.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:40):**  I mean, in terms of economy, it's the seventh in the world if it would be a separate country.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:43):**  So in terms of agriculture, it would be, I wouldn't know, somewhere around the 10th maybe.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:48):**  And it's, yeah, if you drive through California, you see the negative impact mostly of what  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:54):**  agriculture has been.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:22:55):**  Especially if you read the earliest descriptions of how California used to be, or you look  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:00):**  when the first European settlers came in, what kind of abundance there was.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:04):**  Obviously as a managed system, because the landscape had been managed, but you can see  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:07):**  how quickly that has turned into pretty much a desert.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:11):**  It's a desert now.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:12):**  And water is becoming a really central issue that only regenerative ag can solve.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:18):**  More pipes.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:19):**  No, no.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:20):**  I saw the signs.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:21):**  I was driving through California in October and yeah, you can see the desert and the water  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:24):**  and it's quite depressing, honestly.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:27):**  It was a real eye opener for me.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:28):**  We work a lot on bees, honey bees, and most of the nation's bees during the summertime  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:33):**  they live by us, right?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:35):**  And then during the early in the year, we ship most of the nation's bees out to California  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:42):**  to pollinate tree crops, especially almonds.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:46):**  So anything that I'm doing to try to save the bees up in South Dakota is completely  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:50):**  negated when they get hosed down by every agrochemical under the sun in California.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:23:55):**  It's a miracle they still come back sort of alive when they come back to you after the...  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:00):**  No they don't actually.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:01):**  No, they don't.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:02):**  That's the problem is that they don't.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:05):**  Sometimes they're dead hives walking, but they're dead.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:09):**  And so it became real clear that we need to start working on agriculture out in California.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:14):**  And you're saying this study is going to change California in agriculture?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:18):**  Right.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:19):**  Without giving away too much, how do you see that happening?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:22):**  Why would you say that?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:23):**  It was a very similar study design to what we did in rangelands and what we did in the  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:27):**  corn study and what we're doing in the cash grain systems.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:30):**  We just found the most progressive regenerative almond producers, and there wasn't many, but  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:36):**  we found them.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:37):**  And then we did a fence line comparison with conventional almond producers right nearby,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:43):**  or even literally right across the path from the regenerative guys.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:48):**  And the regenerative guys are implementing things like perennial ground covers and plant  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:53):**  diversity.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:54):**  They're abandoning all agrochemical use.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:24:57):**  They are increasing compost, compost teas, and then they're integrating animals back  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:04):**  into their orchards.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:06):**  We found six times higher biodiversity in the regenerative almond orchards.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:13):**  And by biodiversity, what do you mean?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:15):**  Primarily insect life in terms of...  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:17):**  Six times.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:18):**  Six times the life.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:19):**  I mean, when we talk about the insect apocalypse and the biodiversity losses of the planet  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:24):**  it's facing right now, that's huge.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:27):**  That's money in the bank.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:28):**  Every one of those insects is worth revenue.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:32):**  We don't know how to value it yet, but it is.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:34):**  And it shows in the profitability of the farm system.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:38):**  Soil organic matter is 30% higher.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:40):**  So carbon sequestration was higher in these almond orchards.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:44):**  That's a huge, what we're talking about, sort of incentivizing carbon sequestration models  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:51):**  and things like that.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:52):**  Water use probably a lot lower.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:54):**  Water infiltration rates were six times higher in the regenerative almond.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:25:59):**  That will change California ag.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah, because now it's like concrete underneath the trees.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:05):**  Not only that, but there's no water to be had, or very little water to be had, especially  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:11):**  in certain regions, and they're planning on taxing what they have.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:15):**  So whenever it comes from the sky, you should hold on it as long as you can, which means  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:19):**  infiltration.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:21):**  But then, I know, go to yields because that's key as well.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah, so at this point, I mean, with the data, we haven't analyzed everything yet, but it  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:29):**  looks like yields are about equivalent in the two systems.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:33):**  Profit was twice as high.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:35):**  Profit twice as high.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:36):**  Flavor?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:37):**  I mean, you must have tried them.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:38):**  So we have nutrient density that we're still running, and then we'll also have, yeah, taste  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:44):**  comparisons and things like that.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:46):**  What are you using for the nutrient density?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:49):**  So we are thinking about nutrient density a little bit differently.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:54):**  We've thought a lot about this over the last few years, about how to measure this, and  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:26:59):**  we're coming at this from an ecological perspective.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:03):**  So right now, everybody's like, oh, it's density, density, density.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:06):**  It's like, density of what?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:08):**  I mean, what are we looking for here?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:10):**  Because within the ecological sphere, we're not interested in density.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:13):**  If you have too much density of one particular nutrient, it's called a pest or one particular  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:19):**  insect or something.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:20):**  So you're looking at an overview or the right composition.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:24):**  So what we're interested is using diversity indices for assessing nutrient diversity and  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:31):**  nutrient content of these different foods.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:35):**  And so we're applying similar ecological principles to looking at the relative abundance and the  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:41):**  number of different nutrients that are available within these different foods.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:45):**  And then we can generate indices that are based on that.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:48):**  Ultimately, we're going to have to evaluate which of these indices are best correlated  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:27:55):**  with our response variables, which is, at the end of the day, human health, right?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:00):**  And your microbiome.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:01):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:02):**  Those are 50-year studies, right?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:03):**  Yeah, what can you absorb?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:07):**  It's great if it's...  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:08):**  And how are you measuring the nutrient availability and thus also partially density?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:15):**  What are you using currently to figure it out in these elements?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:18):**  We're using very inexpensive soil analyses or plant nutrient forage quality things.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:26):**  That gives us a huge range of micronutrients for very inexpensive.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:31):**  The farmers can do themselves.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:33):**  They are doing it themselves.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:34):**  They're just not using it for this.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:36):**  And then we're taking that information and generating indices that then we can compare  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:42):**  with, well, hopefully some things that are meaningful to the customers.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:47):**  And what are some differences you see to the regenerative grown almonds and the neighbor?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:52):**  We don't know yet.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:54):**  The study is still steaming.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:55):**  It's so hot, it's still steaming.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:57):**  We're still working on it.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:28:58):**  To just describe the... because for anybody that didn't have the chance to travel in California,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:04):**  how would you describe a bit visually, obviously, as we are in a podcast, the difference between  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:07):**  the neighbor and a regenerative farm?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:09):**  How does an orchard look like if you stand and you have that fence that you normally  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:13):**  have or a road and you see left and right?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:16):**  What's the visual differences that you can see basically the difference between regen  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:19):**  and non-regen?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:20):**  To the right is your conventional almond orchard and it's absolutely sterile.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:25):**  There's dust.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:26):**  It's grown in dust.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:27):**  It's not soil anymore.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:29):**  And the only thing that's growing are almond trees.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:33):**  The almond trees themselves are probably yielding as much as we think that a conventional orchard  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:39):**  can yield based on chemotherapy that's keeping these trees alive, but it's a sterile environment.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:46):**  And then right across the path to your left is a regenerative almond orchard and under  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:50):**  the ground is...  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:52):**  It feels cool because the plant cover, there's 10, 15, 20 species of plants growing underneath  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:29:59):**  it.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:00):**  There's life in that orchard and it feels alive.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:03):**  It's a place you want to be.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:05):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:06):**  That's exactly it.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:07):**  Thanks for that.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:08):**  I hope everybody could travel a bit too, especially as we're in a period where we're not allowed  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:13):**  to travel at all, to travel to a regenerative versus non-regenerative one.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:18):**  So when is the study, I mean, it's steaming hot.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:20):**  When is it coming out or when is it scheduled to be out?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:22):**  This is work that was done by Tommy Fenster and he's getting his master's degree with  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:27):**  this study.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:28):**  He's writing his thesis right now and we'll be submitting those papers for publication  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:31):**  and open access journals over the next probably six months or so.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:38):**  So this year we'll be able to see the show.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:40):**  My hope is that there'll be 2020 papers.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:43):**  We really need to get this out.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:46):**  So this is another rabbit hole probably.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:48):**  What do you see the role of science in RegenAg ideally?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:53):**  In a supportive role, scientists need to be students again.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:30:58):**  We need to learn from the experts and take that knowledge to help to validate what they're  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:04):**  doing because right now and within regenerative ag and it becomes very difficult for investors  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:09):**  to think about this because it's all anecdotes, right?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:12):**  It's like, oh-  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:13):**  Where are the peer review papers?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:14):**  So and so, he did great things, but there's no data behind it, right?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:18):**  And there's no instance of, yes, it worked on that particular farm, but is it going to  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:23):**  work someplace else?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:24):**  And so science can help with that.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:26):**  And that's what we've been using our science for.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:29):**  The other way that we're using science to help fuel this revolution is to help provide  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:35):**  scientifically proven roadmaps for transition.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:39):**  Because right now there's a lot of early adopters in this, but that's not the majority of farmers.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:43):**  And we need to make it as simple and transparent for those farmers to transition their operations  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:50):**  towards a regenerative model so that we can remove some of the risk that's associated  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:54):**  with that.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:55):**  And the fear and the uncertainty.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:57):**  So what would a roadmap look like?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:31:59):**  So yes, again, this is rethinking how we do agricultural science.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:04):**  So our strategy is, you know what?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:08):**  It's so funny because I've had developed this plan for almonds now and we're doing this  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:13):**  in cash grain systems for general mills.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:15):**  They're trying to transition their supply chain to a regenerative one.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:20):**  Yeah, Mary Jane, the podcast, I would say a year ago, but I'm probably getting the date  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:25):**  wrong.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:26):**  Anyways, we're doing some of the science behind the biodiversity assessments for them to help  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:29):**  with that.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:30):**  Anyways, so I was just asked to provide what's next for the almonds.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:35):**  Like, wow, we're going to do this transition.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:38):**  And so I had to write up what exactly experiments are we doing?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:43):**  And so I'm like, okay, well, I think we're going to have these treatments, right?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:46):**  We need to have treatments and we're going to do this and we're going to have cover crops  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:51):**  here, but maybe we need to only allow certain power crops.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:56):**  And then maybe we'll have another treatment where they're integrating animals, but I wonder  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:32:59):**  which species it should.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:01):**  And I'm like, holy cow.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:04):**  I just went back in time to the corn study again.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:07):**  It's like the other study.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:09):**  And I'm like, what am I doing here?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:12):**  And so it's a reflex.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:15):**  That's what I was trained to do, control everything.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:18):**  And so what our strategy is, is yes, we can provide some guidelines, but what we're doing  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:25):**  is the farmers are going to be transitioning.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:28):**  There's going to be a lot based on this almond study right off of the bat.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:32):**  A lot of our control orchards or some of the control orchards are already transitioning.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:37):**  So it's like, well, we can't use those guys again.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:40):**  Because they see the neighbors.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:41):**  I mean, you just described it visually as a place you want to be versus a place of you  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:45):**  don't want to be.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:46):**  And then they hear the profitability.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:47):**  And I think a lot of them would logically, they would jump on it.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:51):**  Obviously it's not so easy and you're stuck in a system we all created, but you're saying  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:56):**  that many are starting to move.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:33:58):**  And just as a story, we had one of our conventional orchardists come over to the regenerative  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:03):**  guys and we were sitting at the table and we showed him the data just on the pests.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:08):**  And he looked at the data and he's like, I don't believe this.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:11):**  I don't believe it.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:13):**  What you're telling me is that I did everything right.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:17):**  I mean, I followed the university's recommendations.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:19):**  I sprayed five times last year.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:23):**  I sprayed insecticides and I have the same number of pests as my neighbors who didn't  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:28):**  spray at all.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:29):**  I don't believe it.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:30):**  I don't believe what you're telling me, but that guy just transitioned or has just started  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:36):**  to transition 125 acres of almonds over to regenerative this year.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:40):**  That's a lot of insecticides.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:42):**  That's a lot of insecticides.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:43):**  A lot of insects that we need.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:46):**  Tens of thousands of dollars per year.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:49):**  That's another position.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:50):**  That's bringing, keeping a son on the farm or a daughter on the farm kind of money.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:56):**  Wow.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:57):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:34:58):**  So what made him, I mean, I'm assuming it's a him.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:01):**  That's also interesting, but that's for another discussion.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:04):**  What made him, let's say it's him from, I'm not believing this data and he could have  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:08):**  thrown it out and just ignored it.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:09):**  What made him make that step?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:11):**  I think it was the science.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:14):**  I think it was.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:15):**  So it was a reflex of saying, I don't believe this.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:17):**  And then.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:18):**  I think it was.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:19):**  I mean, initially he's like, I mean, he had to throw everything out that he thought was  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:23):**  right.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:24):**  He's been fooled.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:25):**  He had been fooled.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:26):**  And lied to for a long time.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:31):**  By the scientists, by the industry, by everybody.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:35):**  And I'm not saying that that was an intentional, you know, anybody.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:40):**  Well, some people probably was, but now we know better or we should know.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:45):**  And that's, I mean, we were discussing internet before we're in a different world compared  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:48):**  to 40 years ago, 20 years ago, even 10 years ago.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:51):**  I mean, I have daily farmers find your study and find your TEDx talk, go online and find  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:35:58):**  other people, find people even nearby in some cases that are, yeah, they threw out the rulebook  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:03):**  and started from zero.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:05):**  Yeah, that's crazy.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:06):**  And that's, I mean, that's where no strings attached research also comes into play and  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:11):**  that credibility.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:12):**  Can you describe that a bit for the listeners?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:15):**  Where's your funding coming from?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:16):**  What's the model?  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:17):**  Because otherwise if you are connected to the old system of academia, et cetera, you  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:23):**  have strings attached.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:24):**  Right.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:25):**  So one of the first things that we did is that, you know, science as being all of the  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:30):**  studies out of these large institutions are being strongly influenced by where the revenue  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:36):**  is coming in from.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:38):**  And the revenue is coming in from in agricultural sciences, from large seed companies, from  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:42):**  large chemical companies.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:43):**  I mean, shoot, they even have, you know, naming rights on the buildings for grant out loud.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:50):**  That's like, it's crazy in the US right now.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:53):**  And so we said, no, anybody on the production side, we're not interested in taking their  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:58):**  money.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:36:59):**  So our revenue comes from competitive grants and it comes from donations.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:06):**  It comes from education.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:08):**  So when we give presentations or workshops or things like that, we ask farmers pay for  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:14):**  their education and then from farm revenue.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:17):**  So we kind of have to walk the talk.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:20):**  We've been faced with this issue of large food companies and things like that approaching  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:26):**  us because they want a general meals, for example, but others have as well.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:31):**  And how do you deal with that with the potential criticism of, yeah, but you're connecting  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:36):**  to these giants and don't dance with the devil, et cetera.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:40):**  It's really challenging for us because our integrity and our credibility are paramount.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:46):**  I'll go broke before I sell out.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:49):**  I'm not willing to sacrifice that on a personal level.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:52):**  I mean, and I dealt with that at the USDA in a major way.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:55):**  For anybody listening, that's a whole different interview we can do.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:37:59):**  You can definitely Google, you'll find a lot on that, but we're not going to dive into  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:02):**  that now.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:03):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:04):**  I don't have a firm rubric yet.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:08):**  I go by, does the company actually invest in this?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:12):**  Are they committed to this?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:15):**  And if they are, we want to help them in some way.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:19):**  So if it's a multi-billion dollar food company and they're dumping $4 million into regenerative  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:26):**  ag for their beef production or something like that, BS, right?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:31):**  I'm not buying that.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:33):**  Regenerative washing.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:34):**  Right.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:35):**  That's what it is.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:36):**  But for other companies that want to change their supply chain and they're working with  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:39):**  farmers already and a demonstrated interest, to me, I feel more comfortable with that.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:46):**  If Monsanto walked in tomorrow and said, we're really committed to this whole regenerative  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:52):**  ag thing, it'd be like, here's the door.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:54):**  To the soil.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:56):**  Here's the door.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:58):**  We're committed to soil.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:38:59):**  Right.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:00):**  So if you can share, just to have an idea, what does a study like the grain study you  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:06):**  did in 2018, what does it cost?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:08):**  Just to have an understanding of the budgets needed to do things like this.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:13):**  Is it a million?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:14):**  Is it 10 million?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:15):**  Is it 200,000?  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:17):**  What's more or less the range if you can give a range obviously?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:20):**  Can we do a study on a shoestring?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:22):**  Yes.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:23):**  Do you want to?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:24):**  No.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:25):**  We can't.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:26):**  I mean, we're at the scale now.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:27):**  So for the cash grain system for a three-year project, it's probably going to run 1.5 million.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:35):**  For the three-year transition study on almonds, and that accompanies an additional validation  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:42):**  in the Southern range of almond production, that's going to be 1.1 million.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:48):**  That's what we're thinking about.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:49):**  It's a miniature.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:52):**  Nothing.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:53):**  I mean, it's a lot of money for anybody listening.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:54):**  It's not that I don't have it on my bank account.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:39:56):**  But compared to any research budgets, it's really a drop in the bucket.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:00):**  It's a drop in the bucket for the potential benefit.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:03):**  And with a huge potential impact.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:06):**  Oh my God.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:07):**  I mean, look at almond.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:08):**  How many hectares of almonds or acres of almonds is there just in California?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:11):**  Oh God, I'd have to look that up.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:12):**  It's the dominant.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:13):**  It's the dominant.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:14):**  That and rangeland are the dominant agriculture.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:17):**  The dominant, yeah.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:19):**  Vineyards have quite a bit of acreage, but almonds trumps it by a long shot.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:23):**  One soybean farmer.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:24):**  I mean, we did a neonic study that showed that neonic adenoids, that's an insecticidal  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:29):**  seed treatment that's on a lot of crop seeds.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:32):**  So basically just for anybody that thinks, what is he talking about?  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:36):**  What does that do in practice if I'm a farmer?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:39):**  Doesn't do anything actually.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:40):**  And that's the problem.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:41):**  What should it do?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:42):**  How do you use it?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:43):**  Let's, let's refresh.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:44):**  It's supposed to go out there to help control insect pests on your crop.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:49):**  So it's basically, it's like you dip the seed in it.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:53):**  Yeah, it's like a seed coating.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:40:56):**  Anyway, so we did some studies and showed it doesn't work.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:00):**  And so I told some farmers that, and they were like, so we stopped using neonics this  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:05):**  last year based on your study.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:08):**  You saved us $10,000 last year.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:11):**  In one year.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:12):**  One year.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:13):**  I mean, that's one operation, one year.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:16):**  I think, yeah, the potential impact of the financial side of things is just astounding.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:22):**  So almonds, if we can double the profitability of, oh my God, the millions, hundreds of millions  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:30):**  of dollars that would come out of that for.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:34):**  Billions of insects that suddenly.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:36):**  Annually.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:37):**  And maybe some of your bees come back actually alive.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:41):**  That would be.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:42):**  Right, right.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:44):**  Oh, knock on benefits for the community.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:46):**  I mean, the health services, all of these different elements of society that would benefit  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:53):**  from just changing climate change for Brian Outland.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:57):**  Pretty profound, pretty profound.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:41:58):**  It's a drop in the bucket.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:01):**  In terms of leverage and potential impact, it's enormous.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:04):**  Just to shift gears a bit, because I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:08):**  I like to end with a few final questions.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:10):**  What would you do if you would be in charge of a $1 billion investment portfolio tomorrow  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:15):**  morning?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:16):**  You wake up and you had a billion to invest, which could be partly philanthropy, partly  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:22):**  investing.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:23):**  I mean, it's your portfolio.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:24):**  How would you approach that?  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:26):**  A billion dollars is a lot of money, isn't it?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:28):**  That's why I asked the question.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:31):**  Hard to think of that scale.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:32):**  Well, certainly from our perspective and we're thinking about changing the world through  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:36):**  science.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:37):**  And so I'd like some of that to be devoted to creating this national or even international  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:43):**  network of how we conduct agricultural research from a paradigm shift.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:49):**  And we have that entirely laid out.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:51):**  The whole business plan is already thought through.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:53):**  So it's one of those things that's just waiting for a billion dollars.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:42:57):**  So that would be two, 300 million?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:00):**  What would be the range?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:01):**  Probably so.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:03):**  I'll bet that's about what it would take, at least on a-  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:05):**  In the short, but then it would pay for itself.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:08):**  So that's where I would put it and rethinking our entire scientific infrastructure around  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:13):**  agriculture and investing into that because the knock on benefits of that would fuel society's  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:20):**  health and vigor for the next five, 10 generations.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:25):**  What a great investment, use of money.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:28):**  And then if you could, I mean, we're taking off your investor hat.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:32):**  Unfortunately, the fund didn't work out, but if you could change one little thing or one  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:37):**  big thing actually in the agriculture industry from a sustainability point of view, what  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:41):**  would it be?  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:42):**  If you could wave a magic wand and one thing would change, what would it be?  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:45):**  Golly.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:46):**  I mean, that's a difficult question.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:47):**  I mean, that's kind of what would I do?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:49):**  What does the food system of the future look like in 50 years?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:54):**  No more agricultural subsidies except for disasters, making farms, businessmen again.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:43:59):**  That could change overnight with your magic wand too.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:01):**  Yeah, it sure could.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:03):**  Creating this model that we're trying to create for helping integrating these rural communities  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:08):**  again, farming smaller and smarter instead of larger and simpler.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:13):**  Why do you say integrating the communities again?  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:16):**  Because they have been completely disintegrated.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:19):**  Right.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:20):**  Rural communities in the US are the basis of our entire economy.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:24):**  Whether we like to think about that or not, it's absolutely true.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:27):**  I think in many places we don't like to think about it, but it's, we argue most of Europe,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:32):**  unless rural economies does agriculture, because that's pretty much the same thing, unless  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:37):**  we get that to work.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:40):**  All the rest is sort of...  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:41):**  It's just a foundation, right?  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:42):**  I mean, that's the foundation of everything.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:45):**  Which we now figure out as we suddenly all scramble to figure out who do we know that  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:48):**  grows food.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:50):**  We see an empty shelf for the first time in our lives in a supermarket.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:53):**  For many people, I'm not saying, I mean, obviously if you're calling in or listening in other  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:44:57):**  countries that might be something you see often, but here absolutely not.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:01):**  And suddenly, like who has chickens and who has that and who has a big vegetable garden,  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:05):**  et cetera.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:06):**  We're learning the fallibility of that industrialized food system right now.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:10):**  It's pretty astounding.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:11):**  And this is why, I mean, for this crisis is exactly why we founded Blue Dasher Farm and  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:18):**  Ignisus Foundation was this crisis was coming.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:21):**  We saw it coming for the last 10 years at least, and we needed to be here and ready.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:28):**  And now that it's here, we're kind of like scrambling.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:30):**  It's like, all right, get the information out there.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:32):**  We got to start putting out these fires.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:34):**  It's kind of, yeah, it's escalated.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:36):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:37):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:38):**  It does.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:39):**  It does.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:40):**  At least gets us more dialogue.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:41):**  I mean, I mean, subsidies come up very often in these final questions, if something could  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:45):**  disappear or animals outside or something like that.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:50):**  You know what we need to do, what I would do if I had a magic wand.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:54):**  And we've been talking about this in the lab with the scientific team quite a bit, forcing  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:45:59):**  everybody to take off their shoes and walk around outside and feel the connection.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:05):**  You know, winter is long in South Dakota.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:07):**  I don't know if you've ever been here, but it's long in South Dakota.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:11):**  And me and my partner, Christina, we're walking out on the prairie and I've been so stressed  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:18):**  out with Corona and how am I going to keep a Dicis afloat and all of these different  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:22):**  ideas and those research has to come out now.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:25):**  And the farm is starting to wake up.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:27):**  And I went out to the prairie and we looked at the earliest flowers called the Pask flower.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:32):**  And it's just beautiful on the prairie.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:34):**  And I laid down in the prairie and I just looked at that and I felt everything melt  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:40):**  away.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:41):**  That connection with the natural world is a part of us.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:45):**  And it's so fundamental and spiritual and emotional and physical and everything is connected  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:52):**  to it.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:53):**  And we are missing that as a species right now too often.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:56):**  So if I had a magic wand, that's my answer.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:46:59):**  That's what I pick.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:00):**  Go out, take off your shoes on a lively farm.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:04):**  Let's say I'm a live farm because otherwise you burn your feet.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:06):**  Yeah, I think it's a perfect place to end this conversation.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:09):**  I hope it's not the last time we connect.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:11):**  I definitely will be checking in on all the research you're doing in publishing.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:15):**  And thank you so much for your time today, John.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/02/jonathan-lundgren#t=0:47:17):**  And it's been a pleasure.

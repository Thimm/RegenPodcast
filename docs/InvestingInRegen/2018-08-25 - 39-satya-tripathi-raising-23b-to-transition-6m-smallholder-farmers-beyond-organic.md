**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:18):**  agriculture, aiming to take a whole region in India with 46 million people of chemical  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:24):**  fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, all financed by climate bonds.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:29):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:32):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:37):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:38):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:42):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:48):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:52):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:54):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:00:58):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:01):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:06):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:10):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:14):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:18):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:22):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:26):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:31):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:36):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:40):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:42):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:48):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:51):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as a dependent matter.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:56):**  I'm Koon Vasaheen, your host.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:01:58):**  Today I'm talking to Sacha Tripathi, chair of the board of Sustainable India Finance  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:02):**  Facility, a partnership between the United Nations Environmental Programme, World Agroforestry  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:08):**  Centre and BNP Paribas.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:09):**  It brings long term finance to projects and companies that stimulate green growth, increase  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:13):**  resilience, reduce greenhouse gases and improve rural livelihoods.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:17):**  Among them is a project which we'll discuss extensively today, a climate bond of 2.3 billion  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:22):**  dollars to finance the transition of six million smallholder farmers to zero budget natural  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:27):**  farming in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:29):**  As you can imagine, I have a lot of questions on this.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:32):**  Welcome Sacha.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:33):**  Thank you Koon.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:34):**  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to working on connecting institutional  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:40):**  investors to landscapes, to soil, to smallholder farmers?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:45):**  I think at UN Environment, I lead the work of the organisation on Agenda 2030, which  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:02:53):**  is more popularly known as the Sustainable Development Goals, the 17 goals and the 169  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:00):**  targets.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:01):**  And while there's a lot of discussion about indicators, benchmarks, measurement, the resources  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:11):**  are the biggest question, in my opinion, that unless we can find the money that it takes  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:17):**  to achieve the SDGs, the rest of it is just process.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:22):**  And process doesn't interest anyone and certainly not the people at the bottom of the pyramid.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:30):**  And that's why what we are doing through the Sustainable India Finance Facility is play  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:35):**  the role of a catalyst.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:38):**  And I'm delighted that three of the world's leading institutions have come together.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:43):**  UNEP is the world's environmental authority.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:47):**  The World Agroforestry Centre is the world's leading research facility on agroforestry  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:52):**  and related matters.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:54):**  And BNP Paribas is the largest bank in Europe.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:03:58):**  And I'm so delighted that they just won the Euro money best bank of the year 2017 on sustainable  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:08):**  finance.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:09):**  So, we have the right partners coming together with the right intent to make a substantive  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:14):**  difference to the lives and livelihoods of people, because that's at the core of the  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:19):**  climate challenge.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:21):**  You need to have the right kind of livelihood options available to people that takes care  
**[0:04:28-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:28):**  of health, nutrition, education, and both family and community prosperity, which will  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:38):**  then create the kind of resilience we need to deal with the bigger climate questions.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:43):**  Hence the Sustainable India Finance Facility.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:46):**  When you look at this project, which in terms of size, in terms of ambition, seems really  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:52):**  unique and extremely interesting, obviously to me.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:55):**  Can we dive a bit deeper into how did it came about?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:04:59):**  Why this state, Andhra Pradesh, and what is exactly the goal of this project on zero budget  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:06):**  natural farming?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:07):**  So when did this start and where are you now in the process?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:13):**  Let me start by giving you a little bit of a rather preface it a little bit on what we  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:19):**  are doing in India.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:20):**  Please.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:21):**  So there are three big ideas we're working on.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:25):**  The first is, of course, the zero budget natural farming project in Andhra Pradesh.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:31):**  The second is dealing with the air quality in North India and also the other countries  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:39):**  in the region.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:40):**  But we are primarily focused on India as the Sustainable India Finance Facility, but it's  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:45):**  going to benefit the neighboring countries as well.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:47):**  Once the air quality issue is dealt with.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:51):**  And then, of course, we're looking at water as a very, very scarce and valuable resource  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:57):**  for a country like India.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:05:59):**  And much of the water bodies are completely contaminated and unusable, even for agriculture,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:09):**  let alone human consumption.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:11):**  So we focused on these three big issues, sustainable agriculture, water and air.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:21):**  And then, of course, we're working on big ideas on all these three axes.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:28):**  Let me start with the zero budget natural farming.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:31):**  This is something that has been around for a while.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:33):**  Some call it regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:36):**  Some call it geochemical farming, where you don't use any synthetic chemicals.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:41):**  So this is how we farmed before chemical fertilizers came about.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:47):**  And although initially they were seen as a lifesaver because it increased yields and  
**[0:06:54-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:06:54):**  fed the billions, but a few decades down the line, six, seven decades to be precise, we  
**[0:07:02-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:02):**  know now that it has led to rampant use of synthetic chemical fertilizers around the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:13):**  world and more or less destroyed the landscapes across the planet.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:19):**  Not to mention the chemical runoffs into groundwater because nitrates are water soluble.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:24):**  So they're all over the place in our groundwater.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:28):**  And then with the concentrations rising, with every passing crop cycle and of course the  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:35):**  chemical runoff into the oceans, which affects life in water literally in 70 percent of the  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:43):**  planet.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:44):**  So there are huge challenges there.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:47):**  And in India, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the chief minister is a champion in his own  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:54):**  right.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:07:55):**  And he decided in 2015 that while there's a lot of clamour in India for farm loan waivers,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:06):**  perhaps for the right reasons, because the farmer is trapped in a vicious cycle of debt,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:12):**  penury and death.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:15):**  So he said, okay, the immediate urgency is to get the farmers some farm loan waivers  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:21):**  so that looks after their immediate needs, but this can't be a solution.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:26):**  This is more a Band-Aid.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:28):**  We have to look at long term solutions with three goals in mind.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:32):**  And the first was, of course, reduce the input costs so that the farmers don't have to acquire  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:38):**  unsustainable debt, improve the yields and make it healthy.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:45):**  And that's what they did with this zero budget natural farming program.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:49):**  It started in 2015.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:51):**  It's led by a champion called Vijay Kumar, who is at the heart of India's efforts to  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:08:59):**  develop women's self-help groups, starting in Andhra Pradesh, but then across the country.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:06):**  He's the person responsible for leading the efforts that set up the self-help groups in  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:13):**  Andhra Pradesh with 11.5 million women.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:17):**  So you have the right leader at a political level.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:21):**  You have the right leader at a program level.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:25):**  And they have done absolutely outstanding work in the sense that so far they have rolled  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:31):**  out zero budget natural farming to 165,000 farmers.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:36):**  As we speak, the new agricultural season has started and by September there'll be up to  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:45):**  300,000 farmers.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:46):**  And then with the next crop cycle, the winter one, there would be up to a half a million  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:54):**  farmers by March 2019.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:09:58):**  And then that's when we stepped in.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:00):**  We started the discussions in 2017.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:02):**  Eric Solheim, the head of UN Environment, was in Andhra Pradesh meeting with the chief  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:07):**  minister discussing minute details of how we will collaborate and how we will partner.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:15):**  And then we started the work and we are partnered with some of the world's leading research  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:21):**  institutions and others to bring scientific certainty and accuracy to the program because  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:28):**  the fact is that the results speak for themselves.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:32):**  And what are they?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:34):**  What's like an example?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:35):**  I mean, it's always nice to hear the before and after, but a typical smallholder farmer  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:40):**  that is in the process, what's the impact?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:43):**  Yeah, to give you an example, there are tens of thousands of cases where the input costs  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:48):**  have gone down by 80% because you do not use synthetic chemical fertilizers anymore.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:10:55):**  It is purely natural farming and they use cow dung and cow urine as the base and they  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:02):**  use the local variety of cows because one of the guiding principles of zero-budget natural  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:08):**  farming is that all ingredients, including seeds, must be local.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:13):**  Nothing comes from outside, so that protects the integrity of the ecosystem and the regenerative  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:19):**  cycle.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:20):**  And then what they use is cow dung and cow urine of the Bos Indicus variety.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:28):**  Because that's key to have a local variety because it interacts with the soil in a very  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:33):**  different way than an imported one from the Netherlands, for instance.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:36):**  Exactly, because they're all part of the cycle, they consume the same things and they excrete  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:41):**  and so it's a part of the regenerative cycle.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:44):**  And so they use cow dung and cow urine in about 200 different botanical substances,  
**[0:11:50-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:11:50):**  neem, all kinds of beneficial botanical substances, and they make different mixtures which can  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:03):**  be simply, in simple terms, put across as a process of bio-inoculation.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:09):**  So this is not organic farming because organic farming is a process of farming where you  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:14):**  substitute one form of fertilizer for another.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:18):**  So you're basically taking away a chemical fertilizer and using a natural fertilizer,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:23):**  but you're fertilizing the soil nevertheless.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:27):**  Here it is not that.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:28):**  Here it is bio-inoculation, preparing the soil, preparing the seeds to interact with  
**[0:12:33-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:33):**  each other, and then through a complex process of engagement throughout the crop cycle, there's  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:45):**  integrated pest management.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:47):**  But at the same time, there are concoctions that you use to prevent any pest infestation  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:12:58):**  and it has proved amazingly resilient to normal pest attacks and all throughout the last three  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:08):**  years of roll-out that has been going on.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:12):**  So to summarize, the input costs drop dramatically, the outputs increase marginally, anywhere  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:21):**  between 8 to 28 percent depending on the crop and the integrity of the effort you have undertaken.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:29):**  And then last but not the least, there's solid evidence that water requirements for agriculture  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:37):**  drop by almost 50 percent, which is something again we are working with the UNEP DHI Water  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:44):**  Center to document and scientifically establish that this does indeed improve resilience and  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:54):**  efficiency in water use for agriculture.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:13:58):**  And what about the nutrients in the food?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:00):**  Is there a significant difference between the chemical-based ones and the non?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:07):**  I mean, I'm assuming yes, but as you are monitoring everything, are you also monitoring this or  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:13):**  will there be something for the future?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:15):**  We are monitoring this and it will be much more extensive in the future.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:21):**  And I can tell you that there is a big difference.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:25):**  And the difference is not as much in nutrient, but more in the chemicals that you find in  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:34):**  food grains and vegetables and fruits as opposed to natural farming.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:40):**  Here you don't find any chemicals.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:43):**  So that's the difference.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:46):**  So it's more the absence of toxics than it is maybe the increase of nutrients?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:50):**  I wouldn't say there is an increase in nutrients, but that's something that's a more long-term  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:54):**  study.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:56):**  We haven't seen any significant drop in nutrients.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:14:58):**  So that's very encouraging.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:03):**  But then again, there's all kinds of theories to contend with.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:10):**  I think to be fair to those that are practicing it and the scientific community, in my view,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:18):**  this is a more long-term process that would unfold.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:23):**  So we have instituted studies already that will continually monitor this over the next  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:29):**  several years.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:31):**  But then we would really know what really happens.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:36):**  So for the time being, there's no nutrient loss.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:40):**  That I can tell you for sure, but then it has just started.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:43):**  So you can't really say that conclusively unless you have substantive data over numerous  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:52):**  crop cycles.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:53):**  Yeah, and there's a discussion going on in the regenerative agriculture space, which  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:15:59):**  is slowly getting more concrete on the interaction between very lively soil and healthy soils,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:06):**  produce, and then your gut system.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:09):**  But I haven't seen too much research coming out yet.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:11):**  I know some people are working on it.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:13):**  That it's not necessarily even the nutrient increase, but actually that your body is able  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:17):**  to access the nutrients just as the roots of the plant is able to access the nutrients  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:22):**  in the soil because it's much more healthy.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:25):**  Maybe there's a connection there as well between healthy soil, healthy produce, and thus healthy  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:29):**  gut and healthy people.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:31):**  But that's something that's very on the edge of research at the moment.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:34):**  But this, of course, could be an excellent case also to see the long-term health impact  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:38):**  on the farmers, not just of the less chemicals they have to use, but also of their diet changes.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:45):**  Completely agree.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:46):**  I have actually come across these studies you are mentioning, and I'm really eager to  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:16:54):**  see more research happening in this space because this is not rocket science.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:02):**  The fact that if you live within a healthy ecosystem, your body is healthy.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:09):**  It's the same way if you are in a chemical infested area, you pick up all kinds of problems  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:17):**  because your body is processing all those harmful chemicals.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:22):**  And body, like any other living creature, has limited ability to deal with these foreign  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:28):**  influences.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:30):**  And that's why it was really exciting to see.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:34):**  And we would actually welcome anybody that is doing these research to come together with  
**[0:17:39-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:39):**  us, and we'll provide access to all the data and the farmers and the practices because  
**[0:17:47-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:47):**  our vested interest is in finding a solution, not pushing a particular type of idea.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:17:59):**  And the fact that we are working with BNP Paribas and numerous other partners to invest  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:06):**  $2.3 billion into this program to facilitate a smooth transition of the program to 6 million  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:13):**  smallholders, the whole idea is not as much the fact that this benefits smallholders and  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:21):**  it's a good thing to do.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:22):**  That remains.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:24):**  That's the primary goal.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:26):**  But what we think is that this could become the floor or the baseline for amazing research  
**[0:18:34-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:34):**  on a variety of areas, including human health, regeneration of coastal ecosystems.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:43):**  Andhra Pradesh has the second largest coastline in terms of provinces in India, 900 kilometers  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:51):**  of coastline.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:52):**  So what happens when you stop all the chemicals running off into the ocean?  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:57):**  What does it do?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:18:58):**  With the ecosystem and the local climate and the interaction with the sea?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:03):**  I don't think, absolutely, I'm pretty sure nobody has ever done this at this scale, meaning  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:07):**  we need to monitor it.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:09):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:10):**  And not just humans, you know, other species.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:13):**  What happens to fish?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:15):**  What changes in their ecosystem?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:20):**  So there's a lot that can actually come out of it.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:23):**  And it could possibly give us a solution that the world at large could benefit from.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:29):**  Because one of the things that hasn't happened, and I think this is crucial to note, that  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:35):**  although there's a large body of people and thinkers and policymakers who are convinced  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:42):**  that we need to do the right things and we need to turn around before we just drop off  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:49):**  the cliff.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:51):**  But the solutions have just not been there at scale or at a system scale that people  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:19:57):**  could adopt in full knowledge of the outcomes.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:02):**  Because once you have that, then I think the right thinking policymakers, politicians,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:08):**  leaders, the world over, then have something to really choose in full understanding of  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:15):**  the risks and rewards.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:17):**  And then they would be able to take that quantum leap and change things around.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:22):**  Until then, what you hear is that you need external infusion of nutrients in the form  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:30):**  of synthetic chemical fertilizers to be able to grow food with the right nutrient base  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:35):**  that benefits humans.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:37):**  And that's the existing science.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:40):**  And of course, there's a lot more debate now than there was possibly 30, 40 years ago.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:46):**  But then the fact remains that an alternative at system scale hasn't been presented with  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:51):**  all the evidence.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:53):**  So I think the biggest benefit that will come out of the scale out of the JetBNF program  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:20:58):**  would be not just the fact that it benefits 6 million smallholders and by extension,  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:04):**  the 54 million people in Andhra Pradesh province of India, or the 1.3 billion people in India  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:11):**  itself and the rest of the world, but more importantly, present a system scale alternative  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:19):**  that communities and countries can benefit from.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:23):**  And I mean, there's a lot to unpack in there, but let's do it step by step.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:28):**  Because many are working on a thing, there are quite some projects and programs to work  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:33):**  with smaller farmers, smaller groups, like larger groups, etc.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:36):**  But many stop, I guess, at maybe 160,000 that the program is currently reaching.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:43):**  Yes, they will get to 500,000 by March.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:47):**  But then somehow, and I would love to know how that happened, the crazy idea came to  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:21:52):**  raise 2.3 billion dollars in a climate bond, not in a grand, but in a climate bond to finance  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:00):**  the speed up.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:02):**  How did that process happen?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:03):**  And what were you thinking, because it's such a large amount compared to anything else in  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:08):**  regenerative agriculture, and you're going after institutional investors, which are not  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:12):**  known to be the first mover, so it is extremely bold.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:16):**  How did it go from 160,000 to 5 to 6 million and the idea of getting institutional impact  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:24):**  investing capital involved?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:25):**  Well, you know, when we started discussing with the government of Andhra Pradesh, two  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:31):**  things were most striking when we talk to the farmers, the energy is absolutely infectious.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:39):**  They're proud of what they're doing.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:41):**  And I'll just give you an example.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:43):**  We recently launched the scale out in a big ceremony in Andhra Pradesh on the 2nd of June,  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:52):**  just before the World Environment Day that India was hosting this year, the global event.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:22:59):**  And there were about 8,000 champion farmers that had travelled from different parts of  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:06):**  the province.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:08):**  And when I say champion farmers, they didn't decide they are the champions.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:11):**  Their villages voted and decided that these are the best farmers from our village, they'll  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:15):**  represent us.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:16):**  So you had somebody from literally every village of the province.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:20):**  And so we had 8,000 farmers in that gathering.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:24):**  Of course, there were world leaders and others who were also present.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:28):**  And then one of the distinguished visitors was asking me, you know, this is really surprising  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:37):**  that to see the almost classroom, high school classroom, right discipline among the farmers,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:44):**  they're sitting there, they're not moving, they're clapping at every word that comes  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:47):**  out.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:48):**  They're smiling.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:52):**  It's difficult to pull it off, even in a small classroom.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:55):**  How is this possible here?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:23:57):**  And I was telling the gentleman, I said, sir, you got it entirely wrong.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:00):**  This is their show.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:03):**  We are the people that have come here to watch.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:08):**  They are there because they are proud of their achievements.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:12):**  And the world has gathered here to felicitate them and appreciate their work.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:18):**  So why would they even consider walking out and not being attentive?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:23):**  And he said, my God, you actually hit it on the head, because that's what it is.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:29):**  And that is why, and there were almost 50% women farmers there, and they were the most  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:35):**  energetic and enthusiastic.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:38):**  And so, you know, it goes down to the fact that it's about people.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:42):**  And when people are ready to make a difference, they do.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:47):**  And so that's the first thing that we found was most infectious, as manifested on the  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:53):**  second June launch event.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:24:55):**  And we saw that ourselves at a scale of thousands of farmers.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:00):**  And then the chief minister, I asked him actually, when we started the conversation, so why are  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:08):**  you doing this?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:10):**  This is too big.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:12):**  And of course, we all want it to work, but there are always risks.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:18):**  When you're dealing with even 160,000 farmers, that's a good number, but not 6 million.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:25):**  Six million is a lot more, you know, because you're just at about two and a half percent  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:30):**  roughly.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:31):**  And then he said, you know, no, this is not about scoring some brownie points.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:38):**  And Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister, is an amazing human being.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:43):**  His enthusiasm is infectious, as is aspirations for his people.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:49):**  And that's when we were convinced that this is the right kind of province to really step  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:25:56):**  out of our comfort zone and make it happen.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:00):**  And his point was simple.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:01):**  He says, you know, if we are not serving the people in the right way, what are we here  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:07):**  for?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:08):**  What exactly are we doing as leaders?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:10):**  And he said, I see a great opportunity and the UN environment can be a great partner.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:17):**  This was even before Sustainable India Finance Facility was set up.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:20):**  So please help us make it a reality.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:25):**  And then, of course, we asked, what is your ambition?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:27):**  He said, everything.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:29):**  All six million small holders should convert.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:32):**  And so then we started working on the details.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:34):**  And then, of course, we started discussing with our partners, or together with whom we  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:41):**  had set up the Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility in 2016.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:47):**  And it is also a fact that a few months later, UN Environment and BNP Paribas came together  
**[0:26:55-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:26:55):**  to sign a $10 billion MOU to bring sustainable finance to projects and ideas across the planet  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:03):**  with significant social and environmental impact.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:09):**  And so we had a lot of things happening after those conversations with Chief Minister Naidu.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:18):**  And then we thought that, you know, it's something worth doing.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:24):**  And this is something, this is a borrowing that the government is, this is not a grant.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:32):**  And we have started looking at different ways and means with which you could actually make  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:40):**  this cost neutral.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:41):**  And I'll give you a quick example, not that we have agreed with anyone on this, but we  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:45):**  are working on studying the potential and the possibilities.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:51):**  And the idea is this.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:52):**  India currently spends roughly about $12 billion on fertiliser subsidies every year.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:27:59):**  And give or take a few, about a billion dollars is spent in Andhra Pradesh alone as fertiliser  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:06):**  subsidies.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:07):**  So in terms of a simple arithmetic, because this form of agriculture completely oviates  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:12):**  the need for any synthetic chemical fertilisers and pesticides, that's a guiding principle,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:18):**  when you are completely scaled up to system level.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:23):**  You're going to save about a billion a year.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:26):**  In perpetuity.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:28):**  So only that would be enough.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:29):**  I mean, you need to scale to 6 million farmers more than enough to pay back in less than  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:34):**  three years, obviously.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:35):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:36):**  And so, but of course, you would have a scaled rollout.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:40):**  So it would be a phased rollout.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:43):**  And obviously, it will take a little more than three years.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:45):**  So we've targeted five years.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:48):**  So we start around April 2019.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:51):**  And then we end in 2024.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:52):**  So that's basically what it is, the scale out.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:28:55):**  But the savings in this case, because it's a climate bond to a state to a province in  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:01):**  India, so it's not to a company or to a project, it's to the state and it specifically will  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:07):**  only be used to scale up this programme.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:09):**  But in any case, the savings will be probably so large that the cash flow to pay back this  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:19):**  bond is going to be there.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:21):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:22):**  And it will become cost neutral to everybody.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:25):**  It will become cost neutral to the state government because technically the money is being spent  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:30):**  now.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:31):**  So you're just you're going to save and you're going to pay back.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:35):**  And then the central government, which pays for the subsidies, will end up saving a billion  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:41):**  dollar every year.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:44):**  They'll start saving already from this year onwards.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:49):**  But come 2024, they'll be saving a billion dollars with all cost inflation added in perpetuity.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:57):**  So it's a win win win for everybody.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:29:59):**  And that's just yeah, just a fertiliser.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:02):**  Except and I'm going to ask the devil's advocate question, except for the fertiliser industry,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:06):**  how much pushback are you and lobbying, dirty campaigning, etc. are you expecting from an  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:14):**  industry that's taking 20 billion a year in India?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:17):**  I can imagine they're going to play the poor people are not going to eat.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:21):**  This is horrible for farmers, horrible for anybody, carbs quite strongly.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:27):**  What are you seeing there?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:30):**  I look at everything a little positively.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:34):**  I understand the challenges.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:36):**  I'm not starry eyed.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:40):**  But the point is that I think there are several crucial points to note here.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:52):**  I have a positive take on this.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:54):**  And I look at the fossil fuel industry.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:30:58):**  I look at countries that have been fully dependent on fossil fuels.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:02):**  They're playing dirty.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:03):**  Yeah, they're playing just like the GMOs.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:06):**  They're playing very, very dirty.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:07):**  They did.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:08):**  They've been playing dirty for a while.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:11):**  But now they see the writing on the wall and most of them are changing.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:15):**  You look at a lot of the oil companies worldwide.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:19):**  They're going big into wind, solar and biogas.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:26):**  So they're diversifying their portfolio because you are not a serious business entity if you  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:32):**  don't see the challenges and the risks to business continuity.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:36):**  So what would you say to a leading fertilizer producer?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:43):**  What could be their role in India where zero budget natural farming is the norm?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:52):**  I would urge them to see they are in business.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:31:56):**  They are not in the business of selling a particular thing because a business can be  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:02):**  any business.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:03):**  It doesn't have to be a particular product being sold.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:09):**  As we have seen the evolution of the fertilizer industry, not every kind of fertilizer was  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:14):**  being produced in the 30s and the 40s and the 50s and the 60s.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:18):**  As agriculture has grown, we have seen more pronounced needs in a certain segment of the  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:25):**  fertilizer industry and then those have been met by adding capacity and all.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:32):**  If you look at India's case, I'm coming back to a country level, India imports a lot of  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:42):**  its fertilizers.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:43):**  So if you look at urea and diammonium phosphate, which is more popularly known as DAP, these  
**[0:32:51-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:32:51):**  are the two most widely used fertilizers in India that a lot of it is imported.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:01):**  And this is why, and last year if you look at the third quarter of this financial year  
**[0:33:12-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:12):**  in India, which is between October and December, the by 66 percent.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:21):**  Even if case of Andhra Pradesh, which is a very big agricultural state in India, but  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:28):**  at the same time uses about one-twelve of the fertilizers used in the country.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:35):**  So even if it goes to zero, India is in a big way because India is currently importing  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:41):**  all that.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:43):**  So they stopped importing and it improves the current account, the balance of payments.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:51):**  So from India's perspective, it's a win-win at several levels.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:55):**  And absolutely not defending the fertilizing industry.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:57):**  I think it's adapt or die.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:33:59):**  And if they don't see this writing on the wall, like the energy companies saw or fossil  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:04):**  fuel companies saw 10 years ago, it's their business risk.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:08):**  But I know that they're going to push.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:11):**  They will not go under or change that.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:17):**  I fully agree with you in that analysis.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:21):**  But my limited point is that from India's perspective, they're importing a very large  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:28):**  amount of fertilizers every year, although they have a goal to produce everything within  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:33):**  the country in a few years time.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:36):**  But the fact remains that they're importing a large percentage of the fertilizer required  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:41):**  in the country from abroad, and which puts a strain on their balance of payments and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:47):**  the current account deficit and all.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:49):**  So this helps the country as well at multiple levels.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:54):**  Yeah, no, sure.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:34:56):**  And let's shift gears a bit and look for a second on the bond and the cooperation with  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:02):**  BNP Paribas.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:04):**  So it's 2.3 billion, but you're cutting it in tranches.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:07):**  Can you talk a bit about how it would look like and when more or less you're planning  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:12):**  to do?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:13):**  Of course, you're working on it.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:15):**  What can we expect when?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:16):**  When are you going to fundraise?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:18):**  Well, the target is to get to the market around June 2019, because that's when the funds are  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:30):**  required.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:31):**  The government has its own funds with the support of the government of India, the central  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:38):**  government.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:40):**  And so they have their own resources to get to half a million farmers by March 2019.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:47):**  So they don't need any resources before the next agricultural season, which is around  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:35:55):**  July 2019.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:00):**  So the idea is to go to the markets around June 2019, because as you so very well know,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:07):**  it takes a long time to create the structures, to do the credit rating, to bring the right  
**[0:36:12-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:12):**  actors together, to find a bit of blending so that the costs remain within reasonable  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:24):**  limits.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:27):**  And of course, that helps create the impact and achieve the higher goals.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:33):**  Our thinking is that we'll be raising the money in three different tranches because  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:39):**  the program is such that there are no subsidies being given.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:44):**  This is basically the cost of handholding because it's a very intensive program.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:49):**  So you have to train people, you have to help them throughout for multiple crop cycles so  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:36:55):**  that they not only understand what it is, but become adept at it.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:00):**  There's also part of the program is research and science to establish it as strongly as  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:07):**  possible as we go along and make course corrections if and as needed.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:13):**  Then there's the education element because you need to prepare the next generation of  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:17):**  farmers.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:18):**  And in that, we're working with a whole lot of partners, including the Prince's charity  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:25):**  in the UK, the Prince Charles.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:30):**  And so we're working with a large number of partners worldwide.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:34):**  The Global Alliance for the Future of the Food is a very valuable partner and so many  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:40):**  others.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:41):**  So the idea is to prepare everybody as we go along.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:44):**  So there are technically no subsidies, but there's a lot of costs of rollout, of ensuring  
**[0:37:51-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:37:51):**  that there's no rollback and that the farmers are helped all through the process, not just  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:00):**  in the first crop cycle, but perhaps into the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth crop cycle  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:06):**  so that they all become experts in their own champions farmers.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:13):**  They all become champions in their own right.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:15):**  And this is the most important part of this program is that it is a farmer to farmer extension.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:21):**  And you'll be surprised, Sonny Verghese, who's the president of the World Business Council  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:27):**  on Sustainable Development, he was at the launch of the scale out on second June in  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:33):**  Bijawada.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:34):**  He was there with the top management of Olam International.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:37):**  As you know, Olam is one of the world's largest agribusinesses and we're looking forward to  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:42):**  collaborate with them and the excitement is mutual.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:47):**  So Sonny, in his speech, mentioned that even at 165,000, this is the world's largest farmer  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:55):**  to farmer extension.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:38:56):**  And I can't even imagine what will happen when you get to 6 million.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:01):**  I'm very curious on impact, obviously, on people, but also on the ecosystem.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:05):**  What changes locally on the climate are what happens with droughts and rain?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:11):**  Because you're at such a large scale that you're probably going to influence not only  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:16):**  the microclimate above the land of the individual farmer and not maybe even above the village,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:22):**  but actually probably at a state or a region level, which is quite interesting because  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:28):**  we've never seen that.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:29):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:30):**  And no one has ever seen that.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:32):**  And then, of course, I mean, we have already seen significant changes to the microclimate  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:36):**  because it's been going on for more than three years now.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:41):**  And in some places, seven, eight crop cycles have passed by.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:45):**  And to give you a quick example, a normal healthy soil is supposed to have roughly about  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:51):**  70 earthworms per cubic meter of soil.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:39:57):**  And here in many places, we've done the counts and they're up to 120.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:04):**  It's amazing what happens when you let the soil heal itself.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:07):**  And of course, the skeptics would say the science doesn't agree because where's the  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:13):**  nitrogen, where's the phosphate?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:15):**  And I fully respect and sympathize with those questions because that's what they know.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:21):**  So that question is very natural because here there's a science that we perhaps certainly  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:28):**  knew a hundred years ago, never understood, but knew.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:33):**  And so we need to bring understanding to that knowledge and a more grounded scientific understanding.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:39):**  And then that's what we're working on with the World Agroforestry Center, with the University  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:49):**  of Essex, with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:40:55):**  So we're partnering with some of the leading institutions in the world to see how best  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:01):**  to establish, observe and establish the science and share it worldwide.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:07):**  Absolutely independent studies with nothing to have to do with the program implementers  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:13):**  other than the fact that they provide access to the data.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:16):**  And who are you targeting in terms of investors?  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:19):**  I can imagine with this amount, so you say three tranches, so about 750 million, it's  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:25):**  mostly institutional investors as most of the climate bonds are so far.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:30):**  Are you targeting high net worth individuals and family offices?  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:33):**  And maybe even because democratization is always a big piece in the discussion on impact  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:39):**  investing and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:41):**  What are your thoughts on where to raise these tranches?  
**[0:41:47-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:47):**  I think my answer is all of above because you really need everybody to come on board,  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:41:56):**  the pension funds, the insurance funds who have a very long term view of these matters.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:03):**  And the recent years has seen a spot of these funds taking a lot of interest in structures  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:12):**  with climate and social impact.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:15):**  Then, of course, there's a lot of philanthropies who have their own investment arms.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:23):**  And there again, there's a huge opportunity because some of these philanthropies that  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:31):**  are doing outstanding work, they keep both of it separate.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:34):**  So investment and arm goes ahead and makes money.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:37):**  Which is the fundamental tension in impact investing.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:40):**  I mean, everybody saying bring them together because you're doing more harm with your investment  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:44):**  arm that you can clean up with your...  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:48):**  So you put it so eloquently.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:50):**  And so here is an opportunity.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:51):**  They can do both and with very little risk because it's a quasi sovereign that is borrowing.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:42:56):**  So it's not like you are giving money to some corporate entity, which could turn out to  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:02):**  be a fly by night operator or somebody who is very articulate in putting across everything  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:09):**  you want to hear, but doesn't deliver the goods.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:12):**  Here, that is not the case.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:13):**  Here is a potential client that has shown its intent and integrity, put its money where  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:24):**  its mouth is, would have taken the program up to a gigantic scale already with 500,000  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:32):**  smallholders by March 2019, after which we are intervening.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:37):**  So this is not things happening in a vacuum.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:41):**  These are things happening from a solid platform of performance, of genuine achievement.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:49):**  That's in the public domain for anyone to go and see and inspect.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:54):**  This is not some lab tests that we are...  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:43:59):**  You hear those a lot.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:01):**  That suddenly five years later you find out that all those wonderful scientific papers  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:06):**  were based on dodgy data and all.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:08):**  Here, that is not the case.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:09):**  This is about people.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:11):**  It's out in the open.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:12):**  Everybody can go and have a look as to what transformative changes are happening across  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:17):**  the landscape.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:19):**  And so I think this should give potential investors a great degree of confidence.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:24):**  A, that it is a provincial government with a track record of performance.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:31):**  Mind you, Andhra Pradesh is growing at more than 10% of GDP consistently, which is bigger  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:39):**  than the national average of India or the global average by a mile.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:45):**  And they have a very good administration.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:47):**  They have a history of performance.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:50):**  This province has been at the heart of India's IT revolution that has helped not only India  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:56):**  but the rest of the world.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:44:59):**  And this chief minister was at the heart of that IT revolution.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:02):**  So he's been around for a long time and is a politician whose commitment to people and  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:10):**  sustainability is above board.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:13):**  So I think at all levels, this adds up to a great investment for anyone who's looking  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:19):**  to make an impact.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:20):**  And what would be the biggest risk for this project?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:25):**  What if you could wave your magic wand and change one thing from the risk perspective  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:31):**  if you have to play the devil's advocate card?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:34):**  What would you see as over the next years as the biggest risk?  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:42):**  I think I think there are pros and cons.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:43):**  I think the biggest risk is that they have an election coming up in March next year for  
**[0:45:55-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:45:55):**  the state government and the chief minister and his party will be up for reelection.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:02):**  And so that is a risk.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:05):**  And this will be a subject, obviously?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:07):**  This is a subject.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:08):**  I think one would be extremely naive not to take note of the fact that the political champion  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:17):**  is up for reelection.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:20):**  So I'm in no position to speculate, although depending on who you speak to, people would  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:27):**  tell you that the ruling party is most likely to win.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:31):**  There will be those that might say that that's not the case.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:34):**  So we stay out of the politics.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:36):**  That's not what interests us.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:38):**  But it is indeed a potential risk that the political champion may not be around to do  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:47):**  this.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:48):**  But that's one part of the risk equation.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:53):**  The fact that it would have already gone up to half a million farmers with benefits for  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:46:58):**  everybody to see is something that makes it an unstoppable force.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:06):**  And we have spoken to politicians across the spectrum in the state and in the country.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:14):**  And there's a huge movement forward in recognizing the potential of what is happening.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:20):**  So no matter who's in power, I don't think it presents much of a risk.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:26):**  This will go on.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:27):**  So that's the first.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:28):**  So there's a pro and the cons.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:30):**  But keeping that in mind, we also decided not to go to the market before the elections  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:35):**  are over.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:36):**  So we would also like the elections to be over.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:39):**  And depending on who's in government, we would revisit the commitments and then we will go  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:46):**  to the market.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:47):**  So we've taken these things into consideration before deciding when to go to the market.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:53):**  And I want to be conscious of your time because we are on top of the hour.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:47:57):**  What would be not investment advice, but if you imagine that there's an audience, a  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:05):**  theater full of impact investors that are into regenerative agriculture and would like  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:08):**  to do more and move their capital, etc.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:12):**  What would you say?  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:14):**  Definitely look at this offer, obviously, and follow this.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:17):**  But where would you give your advice to look specifically?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:21):**  Where should they learn?  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:23):**  What could they learn from this specific, quite bold and already iconic project?  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:29):**  Where should they pay most attention to in terms of their impact investing practices?  
**[0:48:35-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:35):**  Well I think this particular investment opportunity presents a huge palette of possibilities from  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:44):**  the perspective of a very discerning sustainability focused impact investor.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:50):**  This is about land.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:53):**  This is about landscapes.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:55):**  This is about ecosystems.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:48:57):**  This is about the microclimate, the macroclimate.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:01):**  This is about all species.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:03):**  This is about biodiversity.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:04):**  This is about people.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:06):**  This is about human health.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:08):**  This is about oceanic ecosystems.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:11):**  So this is, in summary, this presents an opportunity.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:16):**  There's all kinds of impact investment going on.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:18):**  We're talking about saving the coral reefs.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:21):**  We're talking about saving the oceans.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:22):**  We're talking about saving the species and what have you.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:28):**  Here is an idea that saves everything.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:31):**  So you don't need to take your pick.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:33):**  Everybody, no matter what their interests, can come together and find their results within  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:42):**  the bigger scheme of things here.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:44):**  And I think that is why it is such an exciting possibility in terms of, now if you take the  
**[0:49:49-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:49):**  Rio Conventions just to present you a legal case, the three Rio Conventions, the CCD,  
**[0:49:58-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:49:58):**  the CBD, and the UNFCCC, climate change, biodiversity, and against desertification, this takes care  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:08):**  of everything.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:09):**  So there has seldom been investments that really at this scale target everything in  
**[0:50:16-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:16):**  one go.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:18):**  And this could perhaps be the solution that we are all looking for.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:21):**  This is certainly worth investing and the risks are minimal because it's the government  
**[0:50:26-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:26):**  that is borrowing, a government with a very impressive track record that is borrowing.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:33):**  And as I mentioned, we are working on studies and research on the fertilizer piece that  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:39):**  could make it completely cost neutral, both for the provincial government and the national  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:43):**  government in India.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:45):**  So technically you're not paying back, it is cost neutral and you're saving a pile and  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:52):**  it benefits tens of millions of people at the very minimum, the 54 million people who  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:50:56):**  live in Andhra Pradesh, but the rest of the country and the world.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:01):**  So it's a no brainer to me.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:02):**  You really don't have to make a case.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:05):**  The smart investors would see it for what it is.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:09):**  I want to thank you so much, Sache, for taking the time.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:12):**  I know it's very early where you are and you have a very busy day and busy days ahead of

**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:18):**  Just to be clear, we're not giving investment advice.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:20):**  You should always make your own due diligence, but I'm very much looking forward to following

**[0:51:54-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:51:54):**  landscapes and many millions of acres together with smaller farmers.

**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:53:06):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:53:10):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:53:15):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:15):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:17):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:22):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:26):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:32):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:34):**  Thank you.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:35):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:36):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:43):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:45):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:50):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:54:55):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:00):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:02):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:07):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:10):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:15):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:16):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:18):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:21):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:24):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/21/satya-tripathi/#t=0:55:26):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

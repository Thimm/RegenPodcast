**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:14):**  Why focusing on soil carbon levels isn't nearly enough when it comes to the goals we  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:19):**  seek.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:20):**  Investing in soil carbon sequestration will not create a healthier world for our grandchildren.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:24):**  It will simply create healthier soils.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:27):**  So join me in this conversation with the co-founder of Kistagrand, which after a decade since  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:31):**  she started working in soil health is getting much, much deeper and asking the fundamental  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:36):**  questions around us as a keystone species and the role of regenerative food businesses  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:41):**  in creating the conditions for landscapes, watersheds, and all living and nonliving beings  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:46):**  to thrive.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:48):**  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  
**[0:00:56-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:56):**  mattered.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:00:57):**  Where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:02):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities, and ecosystems  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:07):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:11):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:14):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:17):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear, and consume.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:22):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:26):**  attention to the dirt, soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of Kiss the Ground, who is now  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:01:58):**  leading ReNourish Studio.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:00):**  Lauren, welcome.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:01):**  Thanks, Cohen.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:02):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:03):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up working in, above, and around  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:08):**  soil?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:10):**  I think that there are several things that led to at least co-founding of Kiss the Ground  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:15):**  in this path that I've been on for almost a decade now.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:20):**  One of them is when I was growing up, I was really frustrated and concerned about global  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:26):**  warming.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:27):**  I grew up in the 80s, mid-80s in West Virginia, and we used to make climate change posters  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:34):**  and as kids think about being activists for the climate.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:41):**  So I went to school for international studies, really hoping that I could change the world  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:47):**  to thrive more through policy.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:50):**  And when I was 20, I studied abroad in West Africa.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:02:54):**  And when I was there, I just saw what international aid work looked like and what kind of global  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:01):**  scale philanthropy looked like.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:03):**  And I realized that that wasn't a path for me and that there had to be another way to  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:08):**  work on shifting the conditions that lead to our current reality.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:14):**  And so I didn't know what I wanted to focus on, but I knew that I wanted to focus on just  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:21):**  having life thrive.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:23):**  And so, yeah, it took me many years to find food, but I tried a lot of different things.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:30):**  I moved to New Orleans post-Katrina, and that was a really interesting time because a city  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:35):**  was rebuilding.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:36):**  So there was all this explosion of growth and ideas and kind of imagination and a lot  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:42):**  of young people moved there.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:44):**  And the advantage as a 21-year-old was you could do anything.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:47):**  So if you wanted to build a house, great, pick up a hammer.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:51):**  If you wanted to work on energy efficiency, great, work on that.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:54):**  So I did that for a couple of years.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:03:57):**  And then I got pregnant, which is probably a large turning point in life as well as in  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:02):**  my food journey.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:03):**  Was that the trigger for food?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:05):**  Was that the trigger to focus on food more?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:08):**  I mean, for sure you were eating, I mean, New Orleans is not known to be eating badly.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:13):**  I mean, it sounds silly, but it was probably one of the first points I really deeply considered  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:17):**  what I put in my body because when you're growing a life, you suddenly think about that  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:22):**  immediately.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:23):**  But it led to – I moved to California and it led to really deep questions around where  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:31):**  does our food come from.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:33):**  And that led to permaculture design certificate and really being in communities that care  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:39):**  deeply about food and so many questions about what makes food healthy and what doesn't.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:44):**  So I guess this is a very long answer to your question, but for me, I was kind of always  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:51):**  seeking what was my role in systems change going to be and then had this experience of  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:04:59):**  becoming a mother that really focused in on food.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:03):**  And then, yeah, new Ryland and Finian through community in Venice, California and Ryland  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:09):**  went to this conference in New Zealand where he heard Graham Sate speak about soil carbon  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:16):**  sequestration and he brought him to speak in Santa Monica in this bunker.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:22):**  And there were probably a hundred of us who attended this lecture and Graham is a super  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:28):**  smart human who has so much information in his brain and he never stops talking.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:32):**  So he spoke for like hours and hours and hours and everyone was just like jaw dropped and  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:38):**  maybe kind of a little eyes glazed over.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:41):**  This is amazing and what is this brilliant human talking about?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:46):**  Like a bucket full of information thrown on you.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:49):**  Exactly.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:50):**  And he spoke about soil carbon sequestration and how soil works and yeah, microbes and  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:05:58):**  you would imagine that would be part of your permaculture design course or something.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:03):**  Was it the first time you connected, let's say you're worrisome for climate with your  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:09):**  interest at that point in food?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:11):**  Was that at first that suddenly, I wouldn't say light bulb moments, but suddenly that  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:15):**  connection came because I had the same when I read a book specifically or a chapter specifically  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:19):**  on grazing and carbon, I never imagined soil as a carbon scene, but I didn't do a permaculture  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:24):**  design.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:25):**  And I liked food, but it never went that far and suddenly it clicked and was like, ah,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:30):**  okay.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:31):**  So there is a whole different part, like underground that could serve as part of the solution and  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:35):**  not just a small, making, make it a smaller part of the problem.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:39):**  Was that that click or was it just too much information in the bunker too?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:42):**  It clicked a few days later.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:44):**  Probably both.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:45):**  No, it was a big click and I think, I'm not sure I would have articulated it quite this  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:53):**  way at the time, but the click for me was much deeper than just soil sequesters carbon.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:06:59):**  The click was, I've been told my whole life that what I can personally do in the face  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:06):**  of climate change is be less of a human.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:09):**  Like don't ride to work on a bike.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:14):**  Don't do that.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:15):**  Recycle, eat less, waste less.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:19):**  Enjoy less.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:20):**  Kind of like, don't live, like live less has always been the prevailing message.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:27):**  And what really clicked was this deep sense of hope that actually in becoming more of,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:35):**  not more of a human, but in altering my role as a human on the planet and being a human,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:43):**  that actually can be what would balance our climate.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:46):**  And that's a very different narrative.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:48):**  Right?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:49):**  Like by eating and by tending the earth and by using our natural role as humans.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:07:57):**  Like we're the only species that runs around and can plant trees and can graft trees and  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:02):**  can make a tomato from some weird tasting thing all the way to these amazing heirloom  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:08):**  tomatoes over breeding and many years.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:12):**  We are a keystone species.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:13):**  We're the species that, yeah, we're a keystone species.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:15):**  And yeah, so that was the click.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:17):**  It was like, what?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:19):**  And that unlocked so much hope that hadn't been unlocked before.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:23):**  And then like, I don't know the origin story of the book and then the movie or the documentary,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:29):**  which obviously if you haven't seen it, I mean, stop listening now and go and watch  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:32):**  it now.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:33):**  Like, no, stay here, stay here with us and then watch it.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:36):**  But like what happened though?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:38):**  There was this bunker full of information and information overload.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:41):**  Like what were, what happened after that?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:44):**  How did you start thinking differently in the keystone species or one of the keystone  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:49):**  species thinking like, how did you, how did you walk out of the bunker differently than  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:53):**  you walked in and then what did you do with that new energy and new hope?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah, I'm actually working on writing an article about this right now, looking back after almost  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:04):**  a decade of work.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:05):**  I think what we did was we tried everything.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:10):**  So there was so much energy.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:12):**  You know, friends gathered in Ryland's living room.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:15):**  We gathered every Monday night for several hours and we just went to work.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:22):**  And the thing I wish we had done in retrospect is...  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:26):**  Film that.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:27):**  Document that, that would have been interesting.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:31):**  How do you follow small groups of activists basically trying to change the world?  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:35):**  Sorry, I interrupted you.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:37):**  What did you wish you would have done?  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:38):**  Yeah, I think we did document some of it.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:40):**  And that would be fun to pull out.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:42):**  But what I wish we had done is challenge our theory of change.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:47):**  So we, what I think we did is went into activist mode.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:52):**  And I think that we've been taught a pattern of what an activist is and how we do that.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:09:57):**  And so we just did that without thinking, yeah, so if, if our deep insight is around  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:04):**  humans are a keystone species, what is the way to go to work on that?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:09):**  And what's the way to go to work on that that's effective?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:11):**  And was that the insight of everyone?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:13):**  Because maybe many were at the, Oh, Oh my God, soil is such a big carbon sink.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:20):**  And was it, were you all aligned on, okay, this is, this is bigger than that or beyond  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:25):**  that?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:26):**  Yeah, that's true too.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:27):**  I think that my personal journey and my insight was really deeply around keystone species.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:35):**  I'm not sure we all saw it in the same direction, but we had so many conversations about it.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:41):**  So it was definitely up.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:42):**  We weren't, it wasn't like I was over here thinking, Hey, we're a keystone species and  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:46):**  everyone else was like, soil can sequester carbon.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:48):**  Let's go.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:50):**  We, yeah, we had tons of conversations about it.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:54):**  You know, thought about launching campaigns.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:10:56):**  I still think we should launch this one because it's, well, I'm a nerd, so I think it's cool.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:00):**  But we thought about launching a campaign to lobby the change of the definition of nature  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:07):**  in the dictionary.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:09):**  Cause it's, it's literally defined as separate from humans.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:13):**  Which is hilarious if you look at biology, but yeah, it's like, it cannot be further  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:18):**  from the truth.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:19):**  Like we, but like most of us is actually, it's not us.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:23):**  Like if you look at DNA coming from your parents, like you're 60, 70, whatever the percentage  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:27):**  is other organisms and other stuff that, I mean, somebody called it like you're a very,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:33):**  very well-organized school bus basically for other organisms.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:35):**  That's that's what we are.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:36):**  And we're mostly not us if even us is a, is a specific term.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:40):**  So yeah, it's, but that would be very interesting, but it would be very specific.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:44):**  But yet you went to a book and a documentary very specifically on soil health, but very  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:49):**  deeply on the whole message as well.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:50):**  Like when did that, I mean, you were in a media landscape, obviously in California,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:55):**  like where did you say, okay, how do we, what's the,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:11:57):**  Was that the decision, how do we reach the biggest audience possible and as strongly  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:03):**  as possible, or was it one of the many tries that sort of stick and okay, let's, let's  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:07):**  go in that direction?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:09):**  Our first response was we started planting gardens.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:12):**  And I think that that is a really natural response and a response that's very important.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:17):**  Right?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:18):**  So it's like you hear about this thing, it totally changes your perception of hope around  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:24):**  the climate and then the, what you can do is like, oh, maybe you should plant something.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:31):**  Which you also do, by the way, there's not a message against that.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:34):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:36):**  And so that was one of our first responses is we started planting gardens.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:40):**  We planted one that was a pop-up, which is kind of a hilarious notion.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:44):**  So it was on a vacant lot that ended up getting developed and we thought we had a year or  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:49):**  two and we had three months.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:51):**  So we planted this very short-lived pop-up garden.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:12:55):**  And then we planted another garden that's still there on city land and it covers a whole  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:02):**  block of Venice Boulevard.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:05):**  And that was my first project in Kiss the Ground as I was the garden manager.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:12):**  So we went first to gardens and then we originally incorporated as an LLC or an S-Corp or something  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:21):**  because we really thought, I think it was LLC, we really thought we were going to create  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:26):**  a business selling microbes or selling inoculants.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:30):**  And we wrote all these initial sketches of business plans around compost.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:36):**  And then someone offered us a donation and said, hey, if you become a nonprofit, we'll  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:39):**  give you this cash.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:42):**  Probably the origin story of many foundations or many nonprofits.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:46):**  But it's, yeah, let's set up a structure to absorb that.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:50):**  You said at the beginning, I wish we spent more time on our theory of change and how  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:54):**  to change that.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:13:56):**  This feels like you were doing, not, I wouldn't say whatever came up, but more or less whatever  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:00):**  came up or what worked, trying a lot of different things.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:03):**  In your alternate scenario, how would have that been different if you would have spent  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:08):**  more time on the theory of change of acknowledging human beings as one of the keystone species?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:15):**  We worked on what I think is kind of the activist path that's been set out before.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:22):**  Walk us through that path.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:24):**  What is the activist path?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:27):**  So how do we tell the most people?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:29):**  How do we tell people in positions of power so they can make a change kind of top down?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:34):**  How do we work on the system, putting pressure or encouragement kind of from the outside?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:40):**  So we weren't farmers.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:44):**  Some of us are in the business of food.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:46):**  Rylan's a restaurant owner, but we weren't working inside businesses.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:50):**  We were kind of working from the outside in.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:52):**  And I think that's a pretty typical kind of activist theory of change of how change happens.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:14:58):**  And so then media became media and education became the very clear pathways and then the  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:05):**  short like what you can do list.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:07):**  Right.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:08):**  Because then you ask people to take actions in their own life.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:12):**  And I think the assumption is all those small actions will add up or reach a tipping point.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:18):**  And then you start with a small action and it leads to a long road.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:24):**  It sounds like you're I wouldn't say not believing that happened.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:27):**  But that like in the last 10 years that that didn't happen.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:31):**  Is that is that a fair conclusion?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:32):**  I mean, it's been on the map.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:35):**  We see I mean, soil health is I wouldn't say everywhere, but surprisingly, the common now  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:41):**  on the Joe Rogan podcast on Indian soil health gurus, etc.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:47):**  Like it's being pushed to a certain attention level.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:51):**  I think if you do, like track Google search, you would see soil suddenly being a thing.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:15:58):**  But it didn't change 50% of agriculture land or something in the last 10 years.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:03):**  Like it's still very I mean, if you look at deep regen farms or regen farming practices,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:08):**  it's still a very small percentage of farming that has been complexifying over the last  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:14):**  decade.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:15):**  Yeah, well, the other thing we did is we talked about it as something simple to do, right.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:21):**  And boiled it down to something simple because the idea is something simple is digestible  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:27):**  or maybe easier to implement.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:29):**  But you know, if we if we implement five soil health principles all over the world, which  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:36):**  is essentially what's being positioned right now in common discourse, meaning cover the  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:40):**  ground changes, cover the ground, integrate animals, complex rotations and the like, reduce  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:47):**  chemicals.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:49):**  If we actually do that, we're probably going to sequester more carbon, but we aren't going  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:54):**  to change our food system really at all.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:16:58):**  And we're not going to work on the conditions that are creating all of the carbon in the  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:05):**  atmosphere.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:06):**  We're not going to work on shifting our role as a human species.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:10):**  We're not going to work on watersheds or why people have such differing access to food.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:18):**  We're not going to work on nutrient density.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:21):**  Symptoms, not roots.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:23):**  And when came this realization?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:25):**  Like was it from the beginning for you in the journey or is it something that came over  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:29):**  time over the last decade?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:30):**  Like this is nice.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:32):**  Certainly came over time.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:33):**  We need to go deeper.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:35):**  Yeah, it certainly came over time.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:38):**  And I don't want to discredit the work that we've done, right.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:43):**  So I get to sit here and analyze what happened over the last almost decade because we worked  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:50):**  on creating a movement.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:51):**  And so I get to sit here from this perspective of a lot of people around the world are talking  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:56):**  about soil.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:17:57):**  We sat in a living room in Venice and said, what would it look like for the soil conversation  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:03):**  to be equal to the energy conversation?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:06):**  And I think we've almost achieved that.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:08):**  So I don't want to belittle what we've done.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:11):**  But if I were to look back and start fresh, what would have happened in a decade if we  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:18):**  had looked at the conditions that create soil degradation in the first place and what shifting  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:26):**  our role inside businesses could look like?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:29):**  I think that we'd be in a very different place right now.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:32):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:33):**  How would it look like?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:34):**  Because we cannot go back 10 years in time, obviously.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:36):**  I didn't even know if that would be fun or not.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:38):**  But let's say that we don't run parallel scenarios, or at least not to our knowledge, to our current  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:43):**  knowledge maybe.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:44):**  So we're now in 2022.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:46):**  I mentioned at the intro, you're leading the Renourish Studio.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:50):**  Walk us through what is the Renourish Studio and how is it, I wouldn't say attacking, but  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:54):**  working on those issues in a different way because the issues are still the same.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:18:59):**  But you want to go to the root causes and you want to work on the root causes and not  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:02):**  on the symptoms.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:03):**  So walk us through what Renourish is and definitely we'll put the website in the show notes below,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:09):**  if you want to find out more.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:12):**  So we're launching essentially a three-year cohort.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:15):**  This is a program of Farmers' Footprint.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:17):**  So we're working in collaboration with Farmers' Footprint to do this.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:23):**  Essentially we're going to work on evolving food business models because we really want  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:31):**  to work on root causes and we really want to shift the way business is focusing.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:38):**  So right now business focus is quite a bit on the financial bottom line.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:42):**  I think we can all agree on that.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:45):**  And the more I work with farmers, I see that the finances is this thing that's so, it feels  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:19:53):**  unmovable, like something we can't shift and we're just always trying to work around it.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:00):**  Let's shift with, let's shift soil carbon on farm with a sustainability initiative.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:07):**  Let's get government funding to do that.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:09):**  But we're not touching the business model.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:11):**  And so in the studio, we're going to work on actually regenerating our thinking, which  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:17):**  sounds maybe like a think tank and likely sounds unproductive because it sounds like  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:22):**  you're just going to sit around and talk and think all day.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:26):**  But I've come to really deeply believe that we have to disrupt the way we're currently  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:32):**  thinking to actually see new potential.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:36):**  And so we're going to do this in a very, yeah, we're going to do it in a very structured  
**[0:20:39-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:39):**  way and we're going to learn from living systems and understand how living systems function  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:48):**  and then what it looks like to pattern our thinking or choose to pattern our thinking  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:53):**  after it.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:54):**  So we're going to become really conscious about how we're currently thinking and what  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:20:58):**  it would look like to choose to think from a different angle.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:02):**  And then we're going to look at potential, not from my projection of what I want to see  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:08):**  in the world, but from a system level potential.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:13):**  So how can whole systems evolve?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:16):**  And so we're going to work on our thinking and then ultimately our goal is to set a new  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:21):**  pattern for food business models.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:25):**  And because that's the entry point and how it's for you, the entry point, the food, you  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:30):**  mentioned it twice now, the food business point sits sort of in between us as a consumer  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:35):**  or the like where we eat and then compost, obviously.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:39):**  And we have to talk about nutrients at some point as well, but that's not for this podcast,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:43):**  but it's between that farmer, between the land and us.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:46):**  And there you see the biggest potential if we shift thinking there, if we shift fundamentally  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:53):**  to more regenerative thinking, both sides can really, like all the different sides around  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:21:58):**  it can really benefit from the nutrient density to the land, to the watershed.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:02):**  So we have to change food companies or we have to change companies that process, touch,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:07):**  think, work, move food.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:11):**  And when I talk about food businesses, it's everyone in that cycle, right?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:15):**  So a farm is a food business, a processor, a handler, a retailer, a food brands, a compost  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:22):**  They're all going to be in the co-op.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:23):**  They're all going to be part of the studio in different shapes and forms, basically.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:27):**  So you want that diverse, it's not going to be 10 caterers or 10 farmers.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:33):**  It's going to be a mix of those.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:35):**  In the US for now, you're still looking for more.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:37):**  So if this sounds like very interesting as we're unpacking this, definitely get in touch.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:42):**  And so it's a three year program.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:44):**  Can you walk us through like what are the different phases?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:47):**  Of course it's structured and it's still also depending on the cohort, what's going to happen  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:52):**  in year two and three, but what do you see as this?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:54):**  Why is it three years, first of all?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:22:56):**  And because it seems like a long and a short time at the same time, like it's a big commitment.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:02):**  Walk us through the time of this cohort and what it means.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:06):**  Are you meeting in person?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:07):**  Are you meeting only online or is it a big conference?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:11):**  What's the commitment I'm signing up for if I would?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:15):**  Yeah, so I think to have something meaningful come out of this, we definitely need a few  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:25):**  years together.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:26):**  It's structured so that in year one, we're really working on our own personal thinking,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:33):**  always putting our business front and center, but working on building capabilities to think  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:39):**  from a living systems perspective in our own lives.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:44):**  And then year two, we're going to be working on building capabilities with our business  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:47):**  teams.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:49):**  And then in year three, we're going to build capabilities with stakeholders because no  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:53):**  business works in isolation.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:54):**  We all work with many, many stakeholders.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:23:58):**  So we're essentially going to go around three times and we're going to meet every few weeks  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:03):**  on Zoom for two hours and then three times a year in person.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:09):**  So those in-persons are much more experiential on land.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:14):**  We're going to an old growth forest, a hotel that's creating the conditions for the evolution  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:21):**  of a town.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:23):**  We're going to go to a farm that's really working on rebuilding a place through the  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:28):**  business of farming.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:30):**  So yeah, we're going to visit all these places as well.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:34):**  And what do you hope?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:36):**  I mean, this is difficult.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:37):**  They're all difficult questions.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:38):**  What do you hope that happens to the cohort?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:41):**  I wouldn't say what you hope to get out of it because that's not a fair question and  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:46):**  not an interesting one.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:47):**  But what do you hope that the cohort goes through sort of obviously on a personal, but  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:52):**  also on a company level?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:55):**  What kind of gears would you hope they shift through?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:24:58):**  How would we see, how would you define success for this first program?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:03):**  I think success looks like actually being able to disrupt our thinking and see something  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:11):**  entirely new that isn't from the view of kind of continuous improvement.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:18):**  So super tangible example, the light bulb was not a continuous improvement of a candle,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:26):**  right?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:27):**  So we weren't like making a better candle, making a better candle, making a better candle.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:30):**  We actually saw something new that could be brought into existence.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:37):**  And so I think success looks like actually being able to see the present moment and the  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:43):**  conditions of how our food system works and our role in it and our role as business people  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:50):**  in creating thriving places to see it differently.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:25:55):**  And then we're not going to sit around and talk and see new things and then write a big  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:00):**  work plan and hope to implement it in 10 years.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:04):**  This is very much learning by doing.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:06):**  So every session we're going to be implementing something or working on implementing immediately.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:11):**  Because when you shift your thinking, it's immediate, right?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:15):**  You don't have to really wait for anything else.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:17):**  And so success also looks like really getting to the implementation, right?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:23):**  So it doesn't just work to see something new, but we actually have to figure out how to  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:27):**  implement that and make it work in our businesses.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:31):**  I'm not talking about businesses not making money.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:34):**  I think this only works if we are making money.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:38):**  But we are talking about working in a very whole way instead of working on our business  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:43):**  and making money over here and then saving a pile and doing philanthropy over here and  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:49):**  creating chaos on one side and trying to clean it up on the other.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:26:53):**  We have to bust through that and just see how can kind of like the question of how can  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:01):**  our role as humans as a Keystone species actually heal the climate?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:06):**  How can being a human and being more of a human connected to a landscape heal our crisis?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:13):**  How can being in business actually create the conditions for life to thrive?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:19):**  It sounds like it's a big question, but I really believe that in a small group we can  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:24):**  do it.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:25):**  I want to unpack the small group a bit, but would it be almost fair to say that companies  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:30):**  are Keystone species as well or a collection of Keystone species as they're such a huge  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:35):**  impact on our planet and they take that role seriously?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:40):**  A day, it's not a day.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:41):**  It's us that are running the companies.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:43):**  But if you would make them a thing, then they, I mean, we all know that the negative Keystone  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:48):**  species or the negative effect of these Keystone species and it's time we explored a positive  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:53):**  one if that's possible or at scale or is that pushing it too far?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:27:58):**  Yeah, it's a really interesting question.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:00):**  Like a company becomes an organism if it's run well for a very long time, like the ends  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:05):**  and the end hill.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:06):**  I don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:07):**  Yeah, I know it's just a thought.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:08):**  And I definitely want to think about it.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:09):**  I think about it.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:10):**  But I do think, again, when we're working kind of asking the system to live up to new  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:18):**  ideals, like when we're working as activists saying, hey, everyone, every business, please  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:24):**  make soil health a priority.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:26):**  We're kind of asking for the system to rise to the occasion.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:30):**  And businesses have a way that business functions.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:37):**  And so instead of asking them to add a sustainability initiative that invests in soil carbon, like  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:44):**  how do we fundamentally change the way business happens?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:47):**  And it's just shocking to me how many people think that that's impossible, right?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:53):**  But everything's made up in the world.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:55):**  Everything has been made up by humans.  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:58):**  So why not?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:28:59):**  Why not change it?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:00):**  So why not change that?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:01):**  And that comes back to the small group because we've had examples in the past of small groups,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:06):**  very collaborative of individuals shifting culture quite rapidly.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:12):**  So let's talk about that and why you decide to do this as a cohort with 30 or 20 or 30  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:20):**  businesses or people and not as a massive movement as Kiss the Ground was and is still.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:26):**  When do you stumble upon the track record of small groups shifting culture, which is  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:30):**  what we need in this case, as we made it up anyway?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:34):**  What made you arrive to that conclusion that actually it could be 30 and a few years and  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:39):**  if you do it well, it can shift culture?  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:41):**  A lot of the way I'm currently working comes through a community that I'm a part of.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:46):**  So my personal disruption came through working with Carol Sanford and working deeply in her  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:52):**  community for many years.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:29:54):**  And in many ways, I believe in the theory of change that she puts forward in the world.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:00):**  In which ways you don't?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:02):**  I'll put some links in the show notes below, by the way, for anybody interested in Carol  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:07):**  Sanford.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:08):**  Yeah, the way Carol works is having us deeply consider and evolve our own thinking.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:14):**  So she's not an expert and she's not saying these are the ways to do it, come do it this  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:18):**  way.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:19):**  She's working us through disruptive ways to disrupt our own thinking and try it on and  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:25):**  decide.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:26):**  So I'm playing with this theory of change and more and more I believe in it.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:31):**  But the idea is that change doesn't happen by like the most people doing something.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:40):**  It's a stubborn minority, as Taleb used to say.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:45):**  It's not a majority, but no, it's usually a small, tiny group sometimes.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:51):**  So how does change happen according to that theory?  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:30:54):**  Change happens through a small group shifting a story or a pattern.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:01):**  So a really good example of this is the way marijuana legislation changed in the United  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:09):**  States.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:10):**  So it was illegal.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:13):**  You could go to jail for 30 years for being a dealer or a grower.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:17):**  It was really, really a big deal.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:21):**  As a kid, you're taught that like only gangsters smoke weed.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:26):**  It was criminalized.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:29):**  And a narrative started to emerge, likely mostly from herbalists or holistic health  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:38):**  professionals around this plant is medicine.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:44):**  And that narrative shifted an entire cultural conversation very, very fast.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:52):**  And then we had medical marijuana, and then we had licenses to grow from medical marijuana.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:31:57):**  And within less than a decade, we had legal marijuana.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:01):**  Which if you said that 15 years ago, you would be called crazy for sure.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:06):**  Like that would never happen, never so fast, never in, I mean, not in the US, like anywhere  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:11):**  else, but not here, etc. because the war on drugs was still, is still, but especially  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:16):**  marijuana was still very, very strong.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:18):**  So there's a precedent there.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:21):**  But there's also many, many times it didn't work.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:23):**  Like we tried to shift the narrative and somehow we're still stuck with fossil fuels.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:28):**  Like that's like, how do we make sure this one works?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:31):**  Or how do we create the conditions for the best chance that this shifting the keystone  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:36):**  species, if we have to summarize it like that, it's much deeper, obviously, the keystone  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:40):**  species like to make a significant group, a significant minority of people aware of  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:48):**  that thinking like we are the keystone species, and it's time we take that role seriously.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:52):**  I don't think that the intervention always has to be around shifting a narrative.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:32:57):**  The example I gave that was, but it's setting a new pattern, right?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:03):**  So if business can shift the way it's working to using the resources that flow through it  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:13):**  to actually enable the conditions for regeneration of places, which is the question we're asking  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:19):**  in the studio.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:20):**  I like the flow part.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:22):**  If we can, because there's resources flowing in and out of the business all the time.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:26):**  That's really what a business is, right?  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:28):**  It's transactions that...  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:30):**  It's a flow station.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:31):**  No, that's not the right word, but yeah, it's a collection of flows basically, if you really  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:37):**  summarize it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:39):**  Right.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:40):**  And right now we have a pattern of how those flows can and do kind of flow in and out and  
**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:47):**  what capital needs to do and what investors need to do and the transactions between businesses  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:54):**  and farmers or the transactions between a farming business and a processor.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:33:59):**  We have all these assumptions about how the system needs to work.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:02):**  It's all made up.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:04):**  So we can reimagine every single one of them.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:06):**  There's no rules or laws in any of those.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:09):**  So that's what you're inviting people to do.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:11):**  What if you look at every single flow or every flow that doesn't exist or every new flow,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:16):**  but yeah, what would every single decision you make or every single thing you touch start  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:22):**  nourishing a place?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:24):**  And how do we consider it from a whole place, right?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:27):**  Because looking back again, soil carbon is really important, but it's not the whole of  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:37):**  a thriving system.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:38):**  A thriving place, a forest, for example, it's not just soil carbon, it's biodiversity, it's  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:45):**  all the plants, it's the interaction between them, it's the water cycle, it's the nutrient  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:50):**  cycle.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:51):**  It's so many things, right?  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:34:52):**  And when we work in the single solutions, single problem, single solution mindset, we  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:00):**  miss so much.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:01):**  And it's not actually how life works.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:04):**  Life doesn't work like a machine, but a lot of us are thinking from a very mechanical  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:10):**  mindset.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:11):**  Do you see the attention now for soil potentially leading more people into this deeper thinking  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:18):**  or the risk is if we don't?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:20):**  I wouldn't say immediately, but when they immediately share this deeper holistic thinking,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:26):**  people might see it as an easy solution.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:28):**  Let's just get soil health back in order and we're fine.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:32):**  Or because I don't know, I'm on both sides.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:34):**  I think it's a great entry point.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:35):**  I got very interested in this because of carbon and then got down the rabbit hole and I sometimes  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:40):**  feel it's inevitable people go down the rabbit hole of soil health and go into the inequality,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:45):**  the nutrient density, land ownership, all of it, but also many stay on the surface.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:50):**  So I'm thinking like, what should we make the rabbit hole a bit bigger so it's easier  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:53):**  to fall in?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:54):**  Or we sort of assume people will go down anyway because it's inevitable.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:35:58):**  You start asking deeper, deeper questions when you get into soil health because it's  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:01):**  such a deep topic.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:03):**  Like what do we do?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:05):**  We need to actively make sure they start asking deeper questions or it's sort of the topic  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:10):**  is deep enough that people inevitably go down.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:13):**  Like what have you seen?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:15):**  Yeah, I think if I look at what's happened in the last several years, my original assumption  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:21):**  was we make it simple.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:23):**  We talk about an entry point and then it grows.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:27):**  It certainly patterns my experience.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:29):**  Right?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:30):**  Like I started from-  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:31):**  We wouldn't have this discussion now.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:32):**  It wouldn't go deep.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:33):**  We wouldn't have them deep.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:35):**  I shared my journey and it went from kind of smaller moments to a much deeper thinking.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:43):**  Now I see billions of dollars being invested in very simplistic soil carbon-  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:53):**  Schemes.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:54):** ... initiatives.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:36:55):**  It's such a missed opportunity.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:01):**  Do I think that we would be having different conversations and seeing different investments  
**[0:37:06-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:06):**  if we had talked about systems as a whole and what are the conditions that create them?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:13):**  100%.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:14):**  I think we'd be in a different conversation now.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:16):**  It's a perfect bridge.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:17):**  How would you invest a billion dollars?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:22):**  We didn't set this up, but it was too nice to let it go.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:24):**  Then I want to go to the whole complexity.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:27):**  Let's see what you answer and decide and where we go from there.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:32):**  Let's say you're waking up.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:33):**  You don't have to answer to any investors.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:35):**  It's your money.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:36):**  You won the lottery, let's say.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:38):**  But it is an investment.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:39):**  It could be very, very long-term if you wanted to.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:41):**  You set the terms.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:42):**  It could be any way.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:44):**  It doesn't have to be in agriculture, food, or soil, obviously.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:49):**  How would you put that money to work?  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:51):**  Yeah, I definitely don't have a plan laid out, so let's start there.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:37:54):**  I think that there are people all over the world who are thinking about systems in a  
**[0:38:01-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:01):**  whole way and thinking about and working towards what's their role in evolving the health of  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:12):**  their place.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:13):**  I think starting with identifying people who are thinking in that way and really deeply  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:19):**  working in their place to evolve its health, that's one place to start.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:26):**  I also think that we really need to shift the role of an investor.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:33):**  I think we often think about, especially in philanthropy, your role is to be a gatekeeper  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:39):**  and decide what's worthy and not.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:43):**  Investors, it's usually that plus how do I get a return, very simply.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:49):**  We're ignoring that investors are part of our system and a really big part of our system.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:53):**  In the studio, we're inviting investors to join us because that's part of food business.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:38:58):**  What's an investor's role in a system and how do we...  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:03):**  Which flow are they part of and not?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:06):**  Yeah, the role isn't just to show up and write a check.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:11):**  It's how do we work together to figure out the best way to flow money so that it delivers  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:18):**  value along the way.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:20):**  How does a river move and deliver nutrients and deposit things and pick up things and  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:27):**  how does it create more health along its journey as a flow of a river?  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:34):**  How does money flow and do that same thing?  
**[0:39:37-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:37):**  Yeah, I think shifting the role of investor to working with is a different context.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:46):**  Going back to your question.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:47):**  I think identifying a ton of smart people who are thinking in whole ways about their  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:39:55):**  places and really doing that work on the ground and going to work with them and considering  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:01):**  how can we put this money to its best use to deliver value along its journey.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:06):**  I also think we really need to be investing in infrastructure.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:12):**  I also wear a hat with White Buffalo Land Trust and I work with farmers in the Central  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:16):**  Valley of California on crop specific projects.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:19):**  I'm working on a soil health almond project and one in cotton.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:23):**  Cotton is a rotation crop with wheat and tomatoes and onions.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:27):**  Yeah, especially in cotton, infrastructure is a huge problem.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:32):**  Processing, spinning.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:34):**  In many crops.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:35):**  Domestic manufacturing.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:36):**  Yeah, many crops it is.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:37):**  We just had an interview with Dan Miller of Stewart and I think we talked most of it on  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:42):**  local meat processing.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:45):**  Without that, we can do all the amazing holistic management we want, but if it cannot even  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:50):**  be processed because there are no slots or it's seven hour drive, yeah, we're sort of  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:54):**  done.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:55):**  It doesn't and that's only the tip of the iceberg.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:40:59):**  There's so much more relocalized or localized or whatever the word is processing needed.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:07):**  In terms of nutrients, in terms of keeping flows local, in terms of freshness, et cetera,  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:14):**  it's absolutely essential.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:16):**  And from the moment, okay.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:18):**  And I only mention it as an example of here on the one hand I'm saying, let's not work  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:26):**  from a problem solving, problem solution mindset.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:30):**  And the other hand I'm saying, let's invest in processing, which could be from that mindset.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:35):**  But I do think we need to stabilize a few things in our system before everyone can be  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:41):**  really thinking about whole systems and how do we evolve them?  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:46):**  There's a bit of stop the bleeding that needs to happen.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:49):**  And so there are places to invest where we can do that and places where investment would  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:56):**  unlock the potential for things to happen.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:41:58):**  So if grazing isn't happening in a holistic way because there's no processing facilities,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:06):**  like yeah, that's a place to invest.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:08):**  And I mean, imagining a billion dollars would, I wouldn't say run out, but we'll be put to  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:13):**  work relatively quickly.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:16):**  It sounds like a lot of money, but it isn't at the same time.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:20):**  And so if you wouldn't be investing, I'm sorry, we took away your fund at the moment or your  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:27):**  holding company or whatever structure, every green structure you would probably choose.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:31):**  But you could change one thing overnight in the food and agriculture system, but literally  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:36):**  anything could be better taste, global consciousness, Keystone species thinking.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:41):**  That's another thing.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:42):**  But still, what would you change if you had that magic wand?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:45):**  But only one thing, don't ask for three.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:46):**  I mean, I have some people on there saying, yeah, we'll change this, this and this.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:49):**  The question was one.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:50):**  Yeah, you get a magic wand that creates you three.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:55):**  Yeah, it's not all of it.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:42:59):**  Yeah, I wish I had thought about it more deeply before, but.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:03):**  The first thing that comes to mind is often very interesting.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:07):**  Yeah, I think that if I had a magic wand, I would awaken deep gratitude into how about  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:20):**  how sacred food is.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:22):**  To me, food is our most intimate relationship of connection.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:27):**  It's what makes us or reminds us that we are nature, that we are the ecosystem, that we're  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:35):**  one planet.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:37):**  And I think that, yeah, without a time machine, I'll never quite know, but stories of communities  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:45):**  that lived much more as part of their ecosystem.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:51):**  It sounds like there were rituals around that sacredness.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:55):**  When you kill an animal, there's a ritual around it.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:43:58):**  And so that sacredness was always present.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:02):**  And I think that if every human shifted that overnight with a magic wand, which is a funny  
**[0:44:09-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:09):**  thought, it would be hard to maintain a lot of the extractive system.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:16):**  And what do you feel and see?  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:19):**  I mean, you're in a place in California where technology, I wouldn't say rules, but let's  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:23):**  say technology thinking is omnipresent.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:28):**  What do you say when you meet people that say, yeah, we just figured out technology  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:31):**  solutions for this precision fermentation, precision agriculture, we'll just intensify,  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:37):**  intensify on a small plot and then let the rest rewild and we'll fix this.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:43):**  Our vertical farming indoors, et cetera.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:47):**  What is your normal counter reaction?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:48):**  I'm sure a few people in the audience would like to know because I get it a lot and then  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:53):**  I'm always struggling to have a concise because probably there's such a holistic answer to  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:57):**  that.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:44:58):**  Like it's not a one minute or one sentence answer.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:00):**  What do you tell to people that are just basically saying, well, we'll figure out a tech solution  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:05):**  to our food, ag and land use and sea use obviously as well.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:09):**  I think if I were in conversation with someone who is talking about tech as a solution, I  
**[0:45:15-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:15):**  would really want to ask and get to the root of what they care deeply about.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:24):**  What do you care most about?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:25):**  Because I find when we have conversations about that, it's often about our children  
**[0:45:31-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:31):**  or yeah, like living a good life or everyone having less stress and eating nutrient dense  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:42):**  food and thriving.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:46):**  I would ask that because I think that sometimes we're so far down the chain of improvement,  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:57):**  improvement, improvement.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:45:59):**  Maybe you started from a root like that, but you get to, oh, I'm really concerned about  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:04):**  climate change.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:05):**  Okay, if I'm really concerned about climate change, what are the metrics?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:08):**  How do we work on the metrics?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:10):**  How do we create tech to do that?  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:12):**  Then and then and then and then.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:13):**  We're just so far down this improvement thinking that, yeah, I would start first with what  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:19):**  do you deeply care about and have a conversation about that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:23):**  Then start to really be honest about are the actions we're taking getting us there and  
**[0:46:31-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:31):**  hopefully find an opening around if they are or aren't and have a conversation from there.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:39):**  Some tech is incredible.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:40):**  I don't want to like wipe.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:42):**  We wouldn't be recording this.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:48):**  But why technology and what is its role and what is its role in getting us to what I think  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:46:56):**  most of us are seeking, which is connection and health and just living a good life.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:03):**  Imagine we're doing this in a real theater.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:06):**  So we're on stage.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:07):**  We don't need a lot of tech, maybe for the lighting and the microphones, but and the  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:11):**  room is full of it's a live audience.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:13):**  Let's hope we can do that at some time.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:14):**  And it's full of investors as well.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:17):**  And you can give them a, of course, not investment advice, but like a message or something when  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:22):**  they walk out there, where should they start digging a bit deeper?  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:26):**  What questions should I ask?  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:27):**  What could they do in there?  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:30):**  If they're not part of the cohort, what could they do in their daily life the day after  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:33):**  or even the evening itself to start making some shifts or to start on the journey of  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:40):**  how do I start these regenerative flows?  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:42):**  How do I switch my thinking or at least invite myself to think differently?  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:47):**  What would you tell them as sort of, it's a final question, but for sure there will  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:50):**  be others, but as to end the evening, we're in a nice old theater somewhere and we're  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:47:56):**  giving them a message for when they walk out or when they have a drink at the bar.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:00):**  What would you give them as a, and mainly on the investing side.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:03):**  They think, yeah, of course it sounds amazing.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:05):**  I should have a holistic view on everything, but now what do I do with my portfolio or  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:09):**  with the investment decisions that are on my desk for Monday morning?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:12):**  First I would ask why an annoying amount of times.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:17):**  So just like, just like children, just like children do, right?  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:24):**  Or Ricardo Semler is known for asking, like if he said like three, four times, you get  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:29):**  to the core of everything.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:30):**  Like it's very rare you don't get to a very deep point if you ask why three times.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:34):**  Okay.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:35):**  That's a very good one.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:36):**  Right.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:37):**  Why are you investing or why do you have this money?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:41):**  Well, we can go all those places.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:44):**  Then we can go deep very quickly.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:48):**  But I think that often the metrics that are evaluating investments are leaving out so  
**[0:48:55-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:55):**  much, right?  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:48:56):**  So why do we choose these investments?  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:00):**  What's the impact we really think they're going to make?  
**[0:49:03-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:03):**  So asking tons of questions around there.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:06):**  I also think, again, really shifting the way we view investment to more of a partnership.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:12):**  Again, it's not check writing and...  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:15):**  Control, reporting.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:17):**  Control and a safe bet to get a certain return.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:25):**  What if we really shifted to think of it as a resource that adds value and what kind of  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:32):**  value do we want to be added?  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:34):**  And then how do we steward that resource so it adds the value we're actually seeking instead  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:42):**  of kind of a half baked thought of what the value we're hoping it'll...  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:47):**  We're kind of hoping for something and a return at the same time, maybe without truly considering  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:53):**  if we're actually going to get the returns we're seeking, not just monetary, but ecological  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:57):**  too.  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:58):**  All the others as well.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:49:59):**  And so how can people help?  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:00):**  What are you recording this the end of March, 2022 and should be out somewhere in April  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:06):**  or whenever you're listening to this?  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:08):**  Because obviously it's not live, could be 10 years from now, which would be funny.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:13):**  But what are you currently...  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:15):**  Should people nominate people if they want to be part of the cohort, if they want to  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:18):**  fund this?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:19):**  This is obviously a nonprofit.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:21):**  What are you most looking for?  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:23):**  What would be a help to you?  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:25):**  Sure.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:26):**  Yeah, we're still in the invitation phase.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:28):**  So we have about half the cohort filled and looking for people who are willing and excited  
**[0:50:34-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:34):**  to take a deep journey, stepping into the unknown together and being held in that.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:43):**  And so yeah, if you're interested in joining us or learning more, we've developed a series  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:49):**  of experiential sessions.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:52):**  So instead of talking about the studio, we're having people join Zooms where they can experience  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:50:58):**  what it'll feel like to be in the studio, as well as what does working on your thinking  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:02):**  really feel like.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:04):**  And we're working through self-reflection and just, there's no experts.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:10):**  There's no test.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:11):**  You're not getting an A on what we're presenting.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:14):**  So just...  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:15):**  I mean, there are some questions about like basic questions around soil health that you  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:18):**  have to pass before you get in, right?  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:22):**  No, no, I'm joking.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:25):**  So you can experience it before you sign up, which is great.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:30):**  And then the studio has a cost.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:33):**  We have a team and we're going to all these beautiful places and the way we also view  
**[0:51:39-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:39):**  all the places that we're going to visit and experiences, how can we add value instead  
**[0:51:46-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:46):**  of just paying for food and lodging, like how do we add value that lives on beyond us?  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:52):**  So we're investing in every place that we go.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:54):**  So there's a cost to that.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:51:55):**  So there's a cost to the studio and we're asking people to pay to join on a sliding  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:02):**  scale.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:03):**  So there's also room for donors to help fill in for those gaps.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:07):**  Perfect.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:08):**  And I'll put all the links below if you want to know more in the show notes, the links  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:12):**  to go much deeper and to keep digging, which is essential.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:17):**  I want to thank you so much, Lauren.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:18):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:19):**  We can talk for hours on this stuff, but I would love to check in six months or a year  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:24):**  from now to see how is it going?  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:27):**  How is the cohort shaping up?  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:28):**  How is the work continuing?  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:31):**  How is the journey going for some of the members, et cetera?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:52:34):**  So I'm looking forward very much to check in over time and as this is a journey, I hope

**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:53:32):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:53:36):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:53:41):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:54:41-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:41):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:43):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:47):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:52):**  different means.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:53):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:54:58):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:02):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:55:03-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:10):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:11):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:16-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:16):**  is so risky.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:18):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:22):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:55:27-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:27):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:28):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:33):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:37):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:42):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:55:43-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:45):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:47):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:51):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:53):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/lauren-tucker#t=0:55:58):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

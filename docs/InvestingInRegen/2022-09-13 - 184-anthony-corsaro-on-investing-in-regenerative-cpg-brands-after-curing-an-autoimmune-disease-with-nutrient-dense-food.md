**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:14):**  Why are CPG or consumer packaged goods companies so important in the regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:19):**  And I'm really looking forward to the upcoming regenerative food system investment forum  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:23):**  on October 12th and 13th in Denver, Colorado.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:27):**  Today we're chatting with Anthony who runs the business development there and has made  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:30):**  18 personal investments into the regenerative food and ag space.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:34):**  Plus he healed his autoimmune skin disease by nutrient dense food.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:42):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:46):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:50):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:56):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:00):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:03):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:07):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:11):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:15):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:50):**  at the [[Regenerative Food System Investment Media Company]], but most importantly, the forum,

**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:04):**  So we are very excited to unpack the forum, first of all, but we'll do that in a later  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:08):**  part of this interview.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:09):**  But also the personal story of Anthony, who has been connected to this place for quite  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:13):**  a bit and is very active in it.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:15):**  So welcome, Anthony, to the show.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:16):**  Thanks, Kevin.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:17):**  Great to be here, man.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:18):**  Appreciate it.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:20):**  So as always, the first question, how did you end up focusing on soil?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:26):**  So my family's been in the food business for almost 100 years.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:30):**  My grandfather was, you know, an orphan, actually, in Indianapolis.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:35):**  And he was second or third generation Italian American.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:38):**  And at that time, there wasn't a lot of opportunities for folks like him.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:41):**  But produce wholesaling was a low margin, but a decent opportunity to make an income.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:47):**  And so my dad followed in his footsteps.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:49):**  I told myself I would never follow in their footsteps.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:53):**  And then I actually ended up kind of eating those words as a young adult and worked in  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:56):**  the family business after it had been acquired by a private equity firm and learned a lot,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:02):**  but took a step away after getting great experience there to deal with an autoimmune disease that  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:09):**  I've had since I was about 14.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:11):**  And through the journey with the disease, food as medicine and environmental toxicity  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:16):**  were really the two biggest barriers to me being healthy.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:20):**  And I kind of solve those on the sabbatical and on this decade plus long journey.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:25):**  And I just I don't remember the very, very first thing about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:31):**  that kind of sparked my interest.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:32):**  I mean, obviously, I kind of watched the biggest little farm kiss the ground.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:35):**  People were talking about it.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:36):**  I listened to a podcast with with Dr. Zack Bush.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:39):**  But it was, you know, the topic overall was just a book I couldn't put down.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:44):**  And I just got totally captivated by it.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:46):**  When I was on the sabbatical, I didn't really know what I wanted to do.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:50):**  And I just couldn't I couldn't stop learning about region ag.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:52):**  I couldn't stop researching it.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:54):**  And I realized that, you know, my family had bought and sold millions and millions and  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:59):**  millions of dollars worth of food.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:02):**  But I had no idea how food was grown.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:04):**  You know, I knew how to unload it and put it away and repick it and send it out to grocery  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:08):**  stores and merchandise it and sell it.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:10):**  But I had no idea how it was grown.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:12):**  And so I kind of got obsessed with with soil health and region ag and just dove in from  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:16):**  there.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:17):**  And do you remember what like the trigger that healthy food, healthy soil and your own  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:25):**  health is connected?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:26):**  Because I think many people it's very easy to now talk about it and say, okay, of course,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:29):**  it's connected.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:30):**  And we see the reports coming out.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:32):**  We see books coming out this year.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:34):**  But it's not such an obvious connection, because otherwise, many more people would make it like,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:38):**  do you remember in your journey trying to figure out what to do with this autoimmune  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:42):**  disease?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:44):**  You took a right or left turn at some point and ended up focusing on food?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:47):**  Like, how did that happen?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:49):**  Through a lot of trial and error and some really good naturopathic and functional medicine  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:54):**  doctors that finally after banging, you know, it into my head for quite some time that it  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:58):**  was super important.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:59):**  It, you know, it just sunk in and seeing is believing that that's a saying for a reason,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:04):**  right.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:05):**  My disease is skin related, and I just started to look better overall, totally.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:10):**  And my skin blemishes started to go away.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:12):**  And so there's just no better kind of proof in the pudding than that.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:16):**  And that to me is an extremely important piece of Regen Ag overall.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:19):**  Because if you go to the farms, if you go to a Regen farm, and you go to a conventional  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:23):**  farm in the same day, or the same week or the same month, and you can really see, touch,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:27):**  feel smell the difference, like, you get it, you don't even need you don't need the research  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:33):**  or any of the, you know, all the other great things that we have.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:36):**  But once you see touch, feel smell, you get it.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:40):**  And it could have stopped there, like, is it okay, I fixed it for myself.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:44):**  And you might, I don't know, do a bit of advocacy work for for maybe people with the same, with  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:50):**  the same issue, and then sort of stop there and continue to work in the food space or  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:54):**  somewhere else, because maybe you were tired with that.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:05:56):**  But you didn't like what was the trigger there to say, No, I'm going to actually dedicate  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:01):**  the rest of my career to that maybe the rest, like a good portion of your career to that  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:05):**  to do more than just fixing my own issue.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:09):**  Yeah, the exact trigger.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:11):**  I don't know.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:12):**  I think it just made too much sense.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:13):**  And I was just so, so excited about it.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:15):**  And I also started to see really early on, you know, there, there wasn't, I mentioned  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:21):**  biggest little farm, I mentioned kiss the ground.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:23):**  And I was listening to a ton of your podcasts.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:25):**  And I kind of noticed, we just needed a ton of education and content circulating about  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:29):**  this topic.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:31):**  And so your podcast also taught me like, there's all these great pioneers doing doing investment  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:36):**  work in the space, but we still don't have anywhere near the capital from a public or  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:39):**  a private perspective flowing into the space.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:42):**  And so I think just early on, I saw that void.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:44):**  And I was, I was in a couple of angel deals outside of food and ag.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:51):**  And my mom's a pretty seasoned angel investor, both her and my dad.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:54):**  And I just went to them and I said, Hey, you know, I have I have some capital, would you  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:06:58):**  guys help help me if I started to look at this space, I really believe that it's the  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:02):**  future of food.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:03):**  And I really believe there's an opportunity for all the impact, yes, but also solid financial  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:07):**  returns here.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:08):**  And they really supported that.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:09):**  And that's kind of turned into what Outlaw Ventures is today.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:13):**  And you know, there's no there's no teacher in lifelike experience, you got to get your  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:16):**  hands dirty.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:17):**  And so I think just opening myself up to that deal flow, open myself up to that network.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:23):**  And then I found RFSI.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:24):**  And then all these things kind of started to snowball and domino and it turned into  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:27):**  the beautiful thing it is today.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:30):**  And how skeptical I'm putting words in their mouth, were your parents about this?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:35):**  They're very seasoned angel investors.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:37):**  They've seen the food space from inside and from the family side.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:41):**  And you come with this.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:43):**  I've seen this documentary, and I would love to invest in region food and ag.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:48):**  Like what was their honest response to that?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah, they actually got it right off the bat.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:53):**  So I give both my mom and dad a lot of credit.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:56):**  I think in that is for a couple reasons.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:07:58):**  One, they had saw my transformation from a health perspective and how food, you know,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:02):**  played a part in that.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:03):**  I think my mom was also exploring that for herself.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:05):**  And then, you know, we own a produce distribution business.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:08):**  So we sold fresh healthy food to people, we didn't sell Twizzlers and Skittles to people,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:14):**  you know, so we always ate pretty well, I would say, especially versus the mainstream,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:18):**  we still had the classic, I think 90s children, American sins of fast food and vegetable oils  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:24):**  and some things that I definitely don't endorse now.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:26):**  But overall, we ate pretty well.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:29):**  And food, being Italian Americans was always a huge piece of kind of our vitality.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:35):**  And I think they understood it right off the bat, actually.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:37):**  And so they supported me a lot.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:40):**  And I really appreciate that.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:43):**  And so Outlaw Ventures now grew into, I think, 18 investments.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:48):**  What's the rationale behind that?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:51):**  And what excites you in that?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:53):**  What excites you in a portfolio or the companies you've been working with?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:08:56):**  I obviously put a link below on with all the portfolio companies.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:00):**  So you can dig into that deeper.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:01):**  What has the journey been like?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:04):**  Yeah, it's been a true learning journey, which I've really appreciated.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:07):**  And like I said, there's no way to learn in this life better than just doing.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:12):**  And so the portfolio 18, like you said, two funds, one of the fund is non food and ag.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:18):**  And then the other fund is Trailhead Capital, who's obviously a pioneering voice in the  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:21):**  region ag VC kind of world.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:25):**  And then 16 directs, one is non food and ag and the rest are food and ag.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:29):**  And within that 15, you have three distribution companies, one the existing family business,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:35):**  and then two kind of new distribution businesses, two ag tech on farm.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:42):**  One apparel that's regeneration nation, one apparel that's the non food and ag, one food  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:46):**  service slash food service tech, a little bit of debt into stewards.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:51):**  So I would call that FinTech and then six CPG or consumer packaged goods, which is where  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:09:57):**  I kind of saw the biggest gap from an angel side.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:00):**  So if you're going to do early stage equity, if you're not going to do debt investments,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:04):**  you really have brands, you have tech and tech can be ag tech, FinTech, supply chain  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:10):**  tech.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:11):**  But I think we've seen some traditional food and ag VC go into more of the tech stuff because  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:17):**  the multiples are better, the opportunity to IPO is better than in CPG.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:22):**  But I really think there is this void right now to support growth stage and early stage  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:28):**  CPG and regenerative CPG, which is kind of being discounted because the multiples aren't  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:33):**  as great.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:34):**  Usually the two to five X revenue.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:36):**  So they're not as high as some of those tech valuations and multiples, but I think there's  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:40):**  a great opportunity for impact and returns in that space.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:44):**  And just CPG is consumer producer, no, what is that?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:48):**  Consumers packaged goods.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:50):**  Packaged goods.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:51):**  So it's the package side of things.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:52):**  It's not the Skittles obviously.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:54):**  But why is it such an exciting space for you apart from the fact that it's neglected and  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:10:59):**  not so much money is flowing into, which is always a reason to look at things, but always  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:02):**  also a reason to be skeptical.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:05):**  So why did you get so excited or are you getting so excited because it's clear that your portfolio  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:09):**  is leaning towards that.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:12):**  If in the future we'll be doing more investments, I'm imagining it will be in that space.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:15):**  Like what's the exciting piece both from a return perspective, but also from the regeneration  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:20):**  perspective in the CPG space.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:21):**  Yeah, a lot.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:22):**  There's a lot of reasons.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:23):**  You know what gets talked about a lot in this conversation is we have to create market demand.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:27):**  We have to create consumer awareness and brands are the greatest vehicle to do that.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:31):**  So brands that taste great, look great, tell great stories.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:35):**  I love brands.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:36):**  I love branding.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:37):**  I love working on brand strategy and go to market.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:39):**  So it's just fulfilling for me to help those organizations with those things.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:44):**  So that's kind of one big bucket.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:46):**  And I think the second big bucket is you can have the chicken and the egg conversation  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:49):**  of, okay, well, do we need to ramp up production first or do we need to ramp up kind of end  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:53):**  market demand and brand demand first.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:11:56):**  And I think we've seen with, has organic scale to the level that we want it to?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:01):**  No, but you have to have brands, you have to have anchor brands with some scale or a  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:07):**  collaboration of smaller brands, creating some scale together that creates that market  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:11):**  demand and pull through for the products, which is going to create the demand for the  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:16):**  practice implementation and integration on farm.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:20):**  And how difficult is it to start a CPG brand and to grow it compared to a tech brand, for  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:29):**  instance, or compared to other pieces in this puzzle?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:32):**  I mean, they're all tricky and all difficult, but I'm just imagining getting into sales  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:36):**  channels like supermarkets, et cetera, or are you actually seeing the biggest potential,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:40):**  I don't know, is online and go direct to consumer?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:43):**  Why is it possible now compared to maybe 10 years ago?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:46):**  We see organic brands, of course, grown.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:48):**  Many have been absorbed by others and have gotten reasonably slash good returns.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:12:54):**  Actually, we have seen some IPOs in the regeneration space, like Vital Farms, et cetera.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:00):**  So what's different now and why is it such an exciting one, apart from that the consumer  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:05):**  probably is ready or seems to be ready at least, but it still doesn't mean it's easy  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:08):**  to set up a Clif Bar, which just got sold, but something like with reasonable size and  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:14):**  not just a mom and pop company that makes great marmalades, but sells at the farmers  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:19):**  markets and it stays there.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:22):**  So it's a super cash flow intensive business.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:24):**  So that makes is one of the big challenging pieces.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:28):**  And there is this thing in CPG, just like there's in this, you know, regional organic  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:32):**  transition on farm is the valley of death.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:34):**  And people usually say it's somewhere 24 to 36 months.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:39):**  And then I think there's kind of individual valleys of death in the scaling from zero  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:43):**  to 1 million, scaling from one to five, five to 10, you know, five to 25, 25 to 50, 50  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:48):**  to 100.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:49):**  And there's kind of these certain benchmarks, but there's all kinds of good information  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:52):**  around CPG brands and what we really, what that playbook is, right.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:57):**  To invest in kind of scale those organizations.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:13:59):**  But why, why is now the time or what's, what's the, what's the compelling reason to invest  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:05):**  there?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:06):**  To me is the consumer, like you said, I mean, if you look at the data on growth in the,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:11):**  in the, in the set and you look at Gen Z, millennials and the kind of products that  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:16):**  they're demanding, this is going to be super important.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:19):**  And I think, you know, over the longterm, if you look at Walmart, Target, Kroger, all  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:24):**  of these big retailers and the sustainability commitments they have to make, especially  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:28):**  if we get into where they have to publicly report things, it's going to be about market  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:33):**  access, even more than market premiums.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:35):**  I think there's always going to be a place for market premiums for brands that have the  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:39):**  best taste, the best ingredients, the best XYZ, but eventually Walmart's going to buy  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:45):**  your product because it has a lower carbon footprint or Walmart's going to buy your product  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:49):**  because you use less water like that, that day is coming and may already be here.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:14:55):**  And so I think from a longterm resiliency perspective and in a return perspective, it's  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:00):**  going to be about market access.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:02):**  And so the people that are on the forefront of building these supply chains outside of  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:07):**  the typical, you know, CPG status quo, I think they're going to have a competitive advantage.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:12):**  And I think that even the larger ones are going to have to start doing that.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:16):**  I mean, we see that with General Mills and all these other people making these huge commitments  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:21):**  to region I.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:23):**  And then the other piece, like consumer seems to be there, maybe the supply chain or the  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:29):**  supermarkets or the large distribution seems to be starting to get a head around in terms  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:34):**  of talent.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:35):**  Like are, I don't know, people that have run this playbook before that maybe were in the  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:39):**  organic space or were in the sort of quote unquote sustainability space or health space,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:44):**  are they coming into this space and could say, okay, I've shown that I can run a bar  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:50):**  company or I run a liquor company or run a tea company or whatever to that 100 million  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:55):**  or whatever.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:15:56):**  Like, do you see the talent coming into the space that we absolutely need?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:00):**  Because it seems like a very, it's a playbook, but it really helps if somebody has done it  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:05):**  before.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:06):**  Yeah, I think most definitely.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:08):**  And I think as retailers continue to support regen brands, we'll see that wave of talent.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:12):**  I mean, Heather Terry, the CEO of GoodSame Foods is a perfect example of that.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:16):**  She worked on Nidmore, which was another chocolate company that scaled to a pretty significant  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:20):**  number.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:21):**  I don't remember the exact revenue number.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:22):**  And now she's, you know, founding CEO of GoodSame, right?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:26):**  And trying to grow this completely regenerative small holder indigenous farmer supply chain  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:31):**  for chocolate, coffee, nuts, these great products, I think baking mixes as well that they have.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:36):**  So I think that's a perfect example of, it's just like climate tech, right?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:40):**  We're going to see this, we're going to see this wave of talent go from tech to climate  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:44):**  tech.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:45):**  We're going to see this wave of talent go from food and ag traditional to to regen food  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:49):**  and ag.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:50):**  I mean, I'm an example of that, right?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:53):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:55):**  So and this is very US focused.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:16:59):**  Do you see are you following the space outside the US as well or outside North America?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:03):**  Let's include Canada and Mexico as well.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:05):**  But do you see the outside, there similar movements or you get approached a lot?  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:10):**  Or what have you seen if you have and if any outside the outside North America?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, I think I've heard some good things about what's going on in the UK.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:18):**  I've looked at two or three deals there.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:20):**  I've looked at a Brazilian deal.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:21):**  So there's definitely some things going on outside of the US.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:24):**  But I definitely don't, I wish I had more time to look more in those places than I do.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:30):**  But you know, once again, it's going to come down to what the consumers demanding, what  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:36):**  sustainability commitments the retailer has made, and then what kind of reporting those  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:40):**  people are going to be required to do it because that's going to that's going to determine  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:44):**  how they purchase.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:47):**  And let's talk about what's absorbing your time actually, which is the forum which is  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:50):**  coming up.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:51):**  We're recording this end of summer 2022, actually the end of August.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:55):**  So it's very soon and not very soon.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:57):**  So I'm imagining you're extremely busy.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:17:59):**  Like what's what's going to happen?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:00):**  Because I've been there three years ago, or we've been actually three years ago, which  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:05):**  was amazing.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:06):**  Two years ago, obviously, it was online last year, it was mostly because of travel impossible  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:10):**  to get to the US.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:12):**  And you've moved places.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:13):**  Like what's going to happen in October?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:15):**  Yeah, year four.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:17):**  Super excited.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:18):**  I mean, Sarah and Rachel and our team have put so so much work into this event.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:22):**  So so thankful for them and all their hard work.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:26):**  But I think it's gonna be a big leap for us.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:27):**  I mean, we had we had about 180 last year, which I thought was really solid.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:32):**  Given the I forget what variant at the time had just kind of reared its ugly head, but  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:37):**  people were still very excited to be there be back in person.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:39):**  We'll have 300 plus this year, we'll have 35 plus speakers, two full days of stuff going  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:44):**  on, you know, nine plus hours of networking.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:46):**  We've got new fundraising happy hour, we've got pitches, we've got breakout sessions,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:50):**  we have a new venue, like you mentioned, where we'll have different things kind of going  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:55):**  on more than just one stage.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:56):**  And that's the only the only thing going on.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:18:58):**  So I'm really excited about it.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:00):**  We're really excited about it.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:03):**  Super appreciative of, you know, our sponsors and speakers and all the people that will  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:06):**  help us bring it all together.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:09):**  You know, traditionally, in that event business, everyone signs up late, that's just part of  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:13):**  our business, right?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:15):**  Half the tickets are already gone.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:18):**  And I think this Wednesday will be the seven week out Mark, I mean, that's that's unprecedented.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:22):**  And so it speaks to a few things.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:25):**  One, the space is exploding, which is great and needed.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:29):**  And two, you know, we're really taking a step up as an organization and as an event and  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:33):**  hopefully bringing a lot of value to the space.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:35):**  So we're happy and proud of both of those things.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:38):**  And for people coming from overseas, let's say, how would you quote unquote, sell it  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:43):**  to them?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:44):**  Because obviously, it's a long trip.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:45):**  If you come I remember people came from New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, I saw Bet Glover  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:50):**  there, I think he's going to come back as well.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:51):**  But they have a big business in the US as well now.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:54):**  So how would you say for people coming over from Europe or coming from, let's say, South  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:19:57):**  Africa, or, or places far Argentina, etc.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:01):**  Why should they absolutely be there?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:03):**  And just to make sure that it's not a US party by itself?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:06):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:07):**  I'm definitely trying to weave more kind of international participation into the event.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:11):**  So I appreciate you teeing that up.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:13):**  I mean, look, it's it's the one thing like it in the whole world.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:16):**  So that would be my number one selling point.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:18):**  And number two, you know, if you are coming from an international perspective, you know,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:24):**  the majority of the people there will be from the US or from North America.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:27):**  So you'll have unique talking points to really network with folks.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:30):**  And, you know, a lot of people in the event business talk about our event does this or  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:35):**  our event does that.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:36):**  But we have had businesses started from the RFSI forum.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:39):**  We have had investments made from the RFSI forum.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:42):**  We have had commercial partnerships made from the RFSI forum.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:45):**  Those are facts.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:46):**  Those are not, you know, it's not marketing lingo.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:48):**  So if you work in the space and you want to get things done, you go to the RFSI forum.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:53):**  It's a good sales pitch.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:20:56):**  Just to shift gears a bit to unpack and of course, I'll put the links below if you want  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:00):**  to sign up and you want to see us there.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:03):**  Definitely make sure you do.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:05):**  And you actually do a lot online as well.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:07):**  So if you cannot make it, there's a lot of online activity going on in general.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:12):**  Next year, you do a lot in Australia.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:14):**  You will do actually quite a bit in Europe as well.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:17):**  And so there's a lot happening online.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:18):**  Plus, you have one of the best newsletters out there, weekly, which is a nice news update  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:23):**  always.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:24):**  But what do you feel like, let's say, the second part of 2022 where we're coming out  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:32):**  of or out of, it depends where you are, incredible heat waves and a lot of attention for climate  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:37):**  at the moment, a lot of attention actually for food and ag.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:40):**  The farm bill in the US is being discussed.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:42):**  There's a lot of discussion in Europe, obviously around climate and land.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:46):**  What would you tell, let's say we're on stage at the forum and I would ask you, what would  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:50):**  you tell all the investors here in the space?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:52):**  Actually, we can do this in a few months.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:54):**  But what would you tell them, obviously, without giving investment advice, what would you tell  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:21:57):**  them to look out for or to focus on or to dig deeper into once they leave that room  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:03):**  in Denver and go back to, quote unquote, work, let's say the day after?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:07):**  What would be your, apart from CPG, obviously, what would be your, go and look there and  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:12):**  go and dig deeper because that needs attention or that's something to dig deeper into?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:17):**  Yeah, I mean, cliche answer, but take a systems approach and really do holistic due diligence  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:22):**  for what you're looking at.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:24):**  I think so many times we get caught in the carbon tunnel vision and the carbon silo.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:29):**  And even there's certain things in region ag that I think we haven't still fully vetted  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:33):**  from a holistic and systems approach.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:36):**  And like?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:40):**  You know, I think the whole.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:41):**  Yeah, just listen, as you can see, we are on video recording this.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:45):**  You can see him doubting if he wants to go there or not.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:47):**  I think the whole spraying or no spraying conversation is very nuanced and people have  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:56):**  a really dogmatic approach to that.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:58):**  Usually one way or the other.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:22:59):**  I tried not to because I do think it's really, really nuanced.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:01):**  And I mean, mainly pesticides, herbicides.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:04):**  So that that would be one.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:05):**  Which is interesting for somebody that brought up toxicity at the beginning of this conversation.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:11):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:12):**  So there's bright, but there's different, there's different levers.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:14):**  There's environmental toxicity.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:15):**  There's soil health.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:16):**  There's farmer profitability.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:18):**  And so it's a perfect example of we have to create systems that produce the least negative  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:25):**  externalities and the most value across all those different levers that I just said.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:30):**  Right.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:31):**  And when people think about food and ag, I had the great the great pleasure of growing  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:35):**  up in a distribution business.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:36):**  So I had to think about what's going on with the growers, what's going on with the packers,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:39):**  shippers, what's going on with us and our our execution, what's going on with the retailer,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:43):**  what's going on with the consumer.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:44):**  So I got a great holistic vision where a lot of people grow up in, you know, the silo of  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:49):**  I'm a farmer, I'm this, I'm that.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:51):**  Right.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:52):**  And you have to think holistically about everything to make really well informed decisions.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:23:56):**  And to me, we got we got into the position that we are in because the system that we  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:02):**  have creates a massive amount of negative externalities.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:05):**  So every every investment needs to be looked at with, OK, making this change or making  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:11):**  these changes is going to produce less negative externalities.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:16):**  That's that's really the frame framing that needs to happen.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:18):**  And that's how I think about that one.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:22):**  And so let's say there are a few areas which require more nuance, let's say, but other  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:27):**  places that are just completely ignored, the sea blazes there would say, please go and  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:32):**  look in that corner because we need I don't have a solution, but we need need attention,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:36):**  brains, money, et cetera.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:40):**  And the thing that I think it's ignored a lot is thinking about all those different  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:44):**  pieces in the supply chain, but thinking about all the workers and laborers in those various  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:50):**  places of the supply chain.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:51):**  You know, I said on the Modern Acre podcast, you know, a week or two ago, like don't get  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:24:55):**  into food systems change if you haven't at least work one hourly wage job in food.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:00):**  And I've I've picked those produce orders like I've worked in our processing department  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:04):**  at the family business.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:06):**  And it's you really need that experience to ground you.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:08):**  And so I would encourage all investors to do that themselves.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:12):**  You know, get out on the farm, do something or make sure you're talking to those people.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:16):**  If you're not talking to those people or people that have great depths of experience working  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:21):**  with those people in your due diligence process, you're missing something in the due diligence  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:24):**  process.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:25):**  I would argue to do also do it.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:29):**  Go and pick grapes for a day, go and pick whatever, go and just to like you said, to  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:35):**  ground you and to first of all, see the extreme privilege.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:40):**  Anybody probably anybody listening to this has and then make sure you you grant your  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:45):**  investment decisions well.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:47):**  And so what let's say in themes on the forum this year, what are the main things that are  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:55):**  let's say different from last year?  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:57):**  Or what do you would you like to highlight?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:25:59):**  What are the big themes that you see that changed over the last 11 12 months since since  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:04):**  the last one came up?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, so themes overall day one has a really heavy land working capital on farm production  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:12):**  kind of a vibe to it.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:13):**  And day two has more of a supply chain brand technology vibe.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:17):**  And we thought that was a good way to kind of divide and conquer.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:20):**  I mean, look, that's the hardest part about what we do is talking about everything we  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:24):**  need to talk about in the length we would like to talk about it in in just two days.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:28):**  I mean, region ag is is exploding right now.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:31):**  And region ag investment is, you know, we once again, we get in our silos, but it's  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:36):**  equity, it's debt, it's grants, it's blended capital, it's production, it's processing,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:42):**  it's distribution, it's ag tech, it's, you know, it's all these things.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:46):**  And so and I haven't even mentioned all the different geographies, right, and all the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:50):**  different cropping systems that we need to talk about it in.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:52):**  And so we definitely do our very, very best to curate what we think are the most important  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:26:57):**  conversations to be had.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:00):**  But those are kind of the two big themes of the days.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:02):**  I think the biggest change from last year is just we went really heavy panels in one  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:07):**  stage last year to guard against losing people to COVID last minute.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:11):**  But this year, I think it'll be much more participatory and engaging from an audience  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:15):**  perspective because we still have panels, but we'll have presentations, we'll have fireside  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:19):**  chats, we'll have breakout sessions, we'll have the pitches, we'll have all that networking  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:23):**  time that I mentioned.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:24):**  So I just think it's going to be an electric event.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:27):**  So I'm looking forward to it.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:29):**  And why moving location?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:30):**  I mean, Oakland, I think was two years.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:32):**  I mean, one year done online, then last year was was San Francisco slash Oakland.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:37):**  Now it's Denver.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:38):**  And what what triggered that?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:40):**  No, no crazy strategic reason.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:42):**  I mean, I think when we look at the landscape of investment, Oakland and Denver Boulder  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:46):**  seem to be the two hubs in the United States.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:49):**  So I would definitely think it's interesting because like California is by far the biggest  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:52):**  production state.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:53):**  Yeah, if you look at it, but the brand space is happening there.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:57):**  Maybe.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:27:58):**  I mean, trail is located there.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:00):**  Matt is Matt Capito is located there.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:01):**  Right.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:02):**  Replant.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:03):**  So it makes sense to region.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:05):**  It makes sense to to be close to that.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:08):**  And and yeah, and at the end, if you find a good location and a good hotel doesn't and  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:13):**  close to an OK airport doesn't really matter.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:16):**  You need to be by major airports.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:17):**  So obviously, check that box.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:18):**  And, you know, for us, it was really about finding a venue that had that diversity and  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:24):**  just had some of the aspects that we wanted.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:26):**  And this venue has all those amazing rooms for all that stuff I just mentioned.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:29):**  It has great natural light.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:31):**  It has what we need to serve the region ag and food from a catered perspective.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:35):**  That's what it's going to be like.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:36):**  Is it going to be catering wise?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:37):**  Because I remember three years ago, that was the normal, I think, Marriott catering.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:42):**  Nothing against that.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:43):**  But it was a normal Marriott catering.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:45):**  What can people expect?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:46):**  So really tough part about the events business, if you work with a hotel venue, they were  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:49):**  very rarely ever let you do anything different to the catered food menu, let alone bring  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:55):**  in kind of snacks and packaged foods.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:57):**  So that's always a challenge.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:28:58):**  And that was another reason why we went with this venue was because we've solicited an  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:02):**  amazing lineup of people to bring packaged foods for the coffee breaks, the receptions.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:07):**  I mean, we're talking ice cream, beer, wine, snacks, coffee, A2, regenerative dairy.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:14):**  We got it all for those sessions.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:16):**  And then on the catered side, found a caterer that has a lot of great relationships with  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:20):**  local organic and regenerative farmers.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:23):**  And then we have a couple of cool brands that are yet to be announced that I think are going  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:26):**  to supply the proteins for both of those catered lunches.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:29):**  Super, very interesting.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:31):**  Now, because I mean, it's a challenge.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:33):**  How far can you push a location?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:36):**  And of course, making it work in a budget, especially having demands that are not so  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:43):**  normal is not easy.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:45):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:46):**  And so what would you consider success?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:49):**  After let's say we wrap up the 13th and ask you a few questions of October and ask you  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:29:55):**  a few questions like after the event, what would you I mean, of course, it would be great  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:00):**  to have deals signed, etc.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:01):**  But that will probably happen the weeks after.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:02):**  Like what would you consider a success after the event?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:06):**  Yeah, I think it depends on who you're talking about.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:09):**  Right.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:10):**  If I'm an institutional investor that's there and interested about the space, if I'm going  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:13):**  to make an investment or I really better understand the space and I'm ready to roll, that's a  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:18):**  success.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:19):**  If I'm a co-head or a fund manager or someone like that and I get a couple of commitments  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:23):**  from people like that or I find a couple of new deals to diligence, that's a success.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:27):**  If I'm an angel investor, I get educated and I and I place in capital.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:31):**  That's a success.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:32):**  Right.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:33):**  So I think it depends on the profile.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:34):**  Right.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:35):**  We have activators coming, which is the people that we call that are getting invested in.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:37):**  So if I'm a soil health indicator organization and I can partner with two investors to scale  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:44):**  my technology to their fields, that's a success.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:47):**  Right.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:48):**  So if I look at Kiss the Ground and Farmer's Footprint and I'm an advocate, but I want  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:51):**  to help spur better success on Farmville advocacy or greater consumer education and I find some  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:30:58):**  investors to partner with or some activators to partner with.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:01):**  I mean, it just runs the gamut.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:02):**  And like I said, we don't want to be an event that's about fluff.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:06):**  We want to be an event that's about results.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:09):**  And it's very challenging to do that as just a four year old event.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:12):**  But we have a track record of doing that.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:14):**  And so my barometer of success is we go back to our sponsors.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:18):**  We go back to our attendees and we say, what did you get out of that?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:22):**  Right.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:23):**  Qualitative and quantitative.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:24):**  And that's how we measure success.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:27):**  And let's flip the question in a sense like, I mean, Outlaw Ventures, you have 18 investments  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:33):**  now and it's your personal capital.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:36):**  But what would you do actually if you would be in the space right now with a billion dollars,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:40):**  you had a billion dollars to invest with inflation at this high, probably should take 10 billion.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:44):**  But let's say a crazy amount of money.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:47):**  And you can make any investment you would like in terms of length, etc.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:52):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:54):**  What would you prioritize?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:55):**  Of course, I'm not asking for the exact dollar amount.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:31:57):**  I'm asking, what would you prioritize if your resources were quote unquote, unlimited?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:02):**  That's an easy, it's a super easy answer for me.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:06):**  Vertically integrated evergreen land fund that buys degraded row crop land, transitions  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:10):**  it to multi species pastured livestock and build your own processing, get vertically  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:16):**  integrated, have your own brand that you sell, you know, all those different various meat  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:20):**  products, grass, beef, pasture, poultry, pasture, pork, you know, eggs.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:25):**  I would do that immediately.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:27):**  And I would use some of that money to also fund research that shows all the ecological  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:33):**  benefits of those systems and the transition.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:35):**  And the last thing I would do is I would set aside a portion of that money for media to  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:40):**  show these transitions, tell that story to both consumers and investors to basically  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:44):**  spur more of these systems created.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:48):**  And because you believe or see or know that, let's say, in the animal protein space, when  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:32:55):**  done well, that's where interesting returns are both environmentally, but also financially.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:01):**  Because you didn't hesitate a second you went like, okay, I'm not going for fruits.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:04):**  I'm not going for coffee.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:06):**  I'm not going for chocolate.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:07):**  Now I'm going for animal protein.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:09):**  What triggered that?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:10):**  Or what's the reasoning behind that?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:13):**  Look, a lot of contention on animal protein conversations, right?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:17):**  Especially kind of the regen versus food tech thing.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:19):**  But for me, meat consumption and not at all.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:22):**  Like, I know one of the listeners, what we had on here talking about olive oil actually  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:28):**  is great.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:29):**  You should follow him on LinkedIn, because every time somebody posts, especially the  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:32):**  chart about beef, the impact of beef of world, what is it world of data, which is extremely  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:38):**  outdated and all the LCA's are already like, they can go into the bin.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:42):**  But he responds to that properly, like explaining why it doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:47):**  And I applaud him for that, because somebody has to do it.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:50):**  But yeah, there's a lot of discussion around it.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:52):**  And you would say, okay, let's go to the heart of that matter.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:33:56):**  And let's follow it, research it, but also produce a significant amount of this money  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:00):**  would be actually used to produce a lot of animal protein.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:04):**  I mean, look, just from a pure demand perspective, demand is growing, consumption is growing.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:08):**  So I don't think it's going anywhere.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:10):**  I don't see people eating fake meat and these other alternatives that have been offered  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:13):**  or whatever we're going to grow in a, in a vat somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:18):**  And one of the most powerful things for me, Kuhn, in my region journey has been, I went  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:22):**  to see Eric Perner and rep provisions, his, his home ranch in Oklahoma I went to last  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:27):**  summer and he had planted just a really small plot of organic corn and he had left the land  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:34):**  right next to it as perennial pasture that, you know, the cows and the pastured pork and  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:38):**  poultry had grazed on.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:40):**  And I mean, it's, it's organic corn.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:43):**  It's good.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:44):**  It's good.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:45):**  You know, it looked nice, but bare soil, you know, no water infiltration, no fertility  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:50):**  and the perennial pasture, all kinds of species of grasses, insects everywhere, birds coming  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:55):**  to it.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:56):**  And we did a little experiment where we, you know, we actually watered it and kind of walk,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:34:59):**  watch the lack of water infiltration, but it was just such a powerful experience for  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:04):**  me.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:05):**  And, you know, ecology one-on-one in North America is that the vast majority of the land  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:09):**  was grazed by bison.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:10):**  So like we need these animals to have properly functioning ecosystems, but we have to get  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:15):**  on the offensive, I think on the animal protein side, especially on the region animal protein  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:19):**  side of this is the right way to do it.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:22):**  This is the, this is the benefit of that.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:26):**  And I think from a land store perspective, you know, I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:30):**  which is like the capital of corn and soy everywhere, you know, with GMO seeds sprayed  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:35):**  by a ton of chemicals.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:36):**  And I drive by those farms and I just see that and it makes me want to cry, you know?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:43):**  And I think we could provide such a better lifestyle for people in the systems that I'm  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:48):**  articulating as, you know, maybe being another option.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:52):**  And just to open another rabbit hole.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:55):**  So what do you think, you're an investor actually, of their investment in, let's say the cell  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:35:59):**  based meats, region meat.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:02):**  I got a lot of responses to that interview.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:04):**  The link below, I think was with Pete overly, but like, what do you think of that approach?  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:10):**  What do you think of that, which is feels at the edge of many things and many people  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:15):**  would say, I will get uncomfortable with that.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:18):**  But what do you, what are your thoughts?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:21):**  Yeah, look, venture capital is designed to take the most risk and invest in the things  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:26):**  that are the most out there.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:28):**  So do I think it's the most purest region thing in the world?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:32):**  Absolutely not.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:33):**  And I think the trailhead folks would admit that to you.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:35):**  And I think they've explained themselves well on your podcast and other platforms, you know,  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:39):**  for that investment.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:40):**  But you know, I think, I think it's interesting and it's going to be tried.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:45):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:46):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:47):**  And it's like a trade in professional sports.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:49):**  We don't really know how it's going to work until five or 10 years until the funds over  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:53):**  and we see the impact is made or the return it's created and both really.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:36:58):**  So TBD, I would tell you.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:01):**  And this is a nice way to bring up a question I love to ask, inspired by Joe Kemp.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:07):**  Hopefully he's coming.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:08):**  I don't know.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:09):**  I should check with him.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:10):**  I met him last night.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:11):**  He's coming.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:12):**  I'm already looking forward to that.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:13):**  But anyway, he always asks, what do you believe to be true?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:17):**  And he asked in general agriculture, but I'd like to ask about region acts.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:20):**  What do you believe to be true?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:21):**  So where are you contrarian?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:22):**  What do you believe to be true about region act that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:26):**  So we're at the event at the forum and like where like where do you feel very different  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:31):**  there?  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:32):**  Like even among your tribe, among your people, where do you feel that you think very, very,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:37):**  very different?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:38):**  People need to start investing more money faster.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:42):**  You know, I think many people would agree on that.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:44):**  But yeah, nothing.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:46):**  Nothing is more frustrating.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:47):**  Like I'm a big content person.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:49):**  I love to talk.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:50):**  But nothing frustrates me more than people who talk and don't do anything.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:37:56):**  And there's a ton of people in the space not doing that and putting their money where their  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:00):**  mouth is and acting and moving very quickly and doing amazing work.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:03):**  So don't want to cast it like it's the entire space.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:06):**  But I do think there's also a lot of people that love to talk.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:09):**  And you know, having been kind of totally ingrained in the ecosystem now since January  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:14):**  of 2021, all I've seen them do is talk.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:17):**  And so the time for talk is over.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:20):**  And let's start doing.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:21):**  So that's really where I'm contrarian is let's learn by failure.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:26):**  If you talk to any of the regen pioneers from just a pure on-farm production, you know,  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:31):**  they didn't learn by thinking about it really long time on their porch.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:34):**  They learned by doing it, trial and error, and seeing what worked.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:38):**  And we have to invest a huge amount of capital in that trial and error with the appropriate  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:43):**  stipulations and kind of things that go along with that.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:48):**  And if you could wave a magic wand and change one thing into food space or food and egg  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:54):**  space or in general, what would you change?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:38:56):**  What would be your one magic wand power change you would make?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:03):**  Yeah, I mean, the subsidies are an easy answer here.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:07):**  And I know you get that a lot.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:08):**  I think it's got to be the answer because they're just so it's just such a non-level  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:12):**  playing field.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:14):**  But maybe taking it a step further, if you mandated that everyone had to grow food for  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:19):**  human beings, I think that would be that would be a pretty significant radical shift that  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:25):**  would change the way they reproduce food and what we grow in this country.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:31):**  And I mean, always the scale question comes up and there is some research, I think it's  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:36):**  one of the understanding egg people actually showing like simply the amount of land we  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:39):**  have currently in production for biofuel, animal feed, etc. is more than enough to offset,  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:45):**  let's say, for the animal production side.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:47):**  Because obviously many people are not obviously many people then easily say, yeah, but we  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:51):**  need to produce this corn for what you just mentioned on the organic corn side.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:39:55):**  Yeah, we need to produce these calories and an animal, a cow needs X amount kilos of this,  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:00):**  etc.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:01):**  Like what do you say to people when they start this?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:03):**  We need to feed the world.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:06):**  We need to feed the world rhetoric.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:07):**  What's your normal response?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:09):**  I'm asking for myself because we obviously get that a lot.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:11):**  Yeah, it's all nice and funny.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:12):**  But it's never going to feed the world.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:14):**  What do you say to people like that?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:16):**  Yeah, I mean, I would tell those people look at PepsiCo, look at General Mills, look at  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:20):**  ABM, look at cargo, look at all these people that have massive businesses and are publicly  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:25):**  traded.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:26):**  And I mean, it's their behinds if this bet on regen ag is incorrect.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:32):**  And we can argue that it's not regenerative enough or it's not, you know, it's we need  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:36):**  to hold them accountable to do more like I get all that.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:38):**  And yes, that's all correct.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:40):**  But like those people being on the region ag train shows you that this thing can scale  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:45):**  or at the very least that the people with the scale are committed to figuring out how  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:50):**  to do it.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:52):**  So there is no greater indicator that this thing's real.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:55):**  This thing is going to scale than that to me.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:40:59):**  And so what do you say to the people like, okay, but that's those were exactly the ones  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:03):**  that created most of these issues.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:06):**  Like how do we make sure we don't just repeat, let's say the sustainability movement or the  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:11):**  organic even and don't get the results we need not only in soil health, but definitely  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:17):**  also in societal health?  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:19):**  Yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:20):**  I don't know what the silver bullet answer to that one is.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:24):**  I think it's just a combination of a lot of things.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:26):**  I think it's really a nuanced conversation that doesn't have some super black and white  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:31):**  buttoned up answer.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:32):**  So not trying to be evasive, but I think that will be really hard.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:37):**  And you talk about land ownership in this country, you talk about power control over  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:40):**  the food system, you talk about social justice and equity.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:43):**  There's a ton of issues there.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:45):**  And we need to do more in regenerative agriculture, I think to talk about those things.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:49):**  I need to do more.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:51):**  I try to do more there.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:41:54):**  But I think it comes down to really, I think you got to start with the ecological consequences  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:02):**  of what's going on, right?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:03):**  Because that is the commons that we all share.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:06):**  So one of the things in RegenAg that gets overlooked, in my opinion, and the easiest  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:11):**  way to make an impact is just input reduction.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:14):**  Like if we just could spray less herbicides, pesticides, nutrients, et cetera, like that  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:19):**  is the easiest, lowest hanging fruit.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:22):**  And it's honestly very easy to track.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:23):**  I sprayed four gallons this year versus 20 gallons last year.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:28):**  And so to me, it's a totally different topic, but it does play a role in that is taking  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:35):**  something that has traditionally been a super singular focused, me, my production system  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:42):**  decision and expanding it to what is the world at large going to kind of see from this choice  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:48):**  that I'm about to make?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:49):**  And how can we enable and incentivize a better decision there?  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:42:54):**  And how can we track and how can we make sure to get a lot of the toxicity and a lot of  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:01):**  the fossil fuel, honestly, out of ag as soon as possible because it makes all of us extremely  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:08):**  fragile.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:10):**  And no, I think it's a good way to end actually.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:15):**  I'm looking forward to the event as you can hear.

**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:43:30):**  And I would invite anybody that can make it to do so and hope to see you there.

**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:44:46):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:44:50):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:44:54):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:44:55):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:00):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:05):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:09):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:12):**  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:17):**  we picked interviewees, what questions should you ask, what is happening in the space, what  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:22):**  should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this space.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:28):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:30):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:32):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:47):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:50):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:53):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:45:57):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:02):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:03):**  No.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:04):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:06):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:10):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:15):**  different means.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:16):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:21):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:24):**  Thank you.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:25):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:26):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:33):**  So you don't have to write along.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:34):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:39):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:45):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:49):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:51):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:46:56):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:00):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:05):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:08):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:10):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:16):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anthony-corsaro#t=0:47:21):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

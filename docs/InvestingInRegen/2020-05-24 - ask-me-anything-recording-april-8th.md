## Ask Me Anything Recording - April 8th  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:13):**  We're definitely going.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:14):**  So what we'll do first of all welcome obviously could be late, could be early wherever you  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:19):**  are.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:20):**  What we'll do in this very informal agenda like structure.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:25):**  I received some questions beforehand.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:27):**  Some people emailed some questions beforehand and I'm definitely going to ask answer them  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:33):**  first and after that please feel free to answer or ask your questions in the chat room.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:39):**  Because if we all unmute at the same time it's going to be quite a bit chaos and I will  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:43):**  get to those questions and I will ask for any clarifying parts.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:47):**  If you can obviously then unmute yourself the moment I'm getting to your question and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:52):**  I will just keep everybody muted for now.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:54):**  Thank you Laura in the call settings.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:57):**  That's a good question but so far we have done I think we have most people actually  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:01):**  on the call already.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:03):**  So we'll get started and I will type I will copy and paste the questions we already got  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:08):**  and into the chat room so you can actually see it.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:13):**  And the first one is from Trudy which is a very deep one we can spend more than an hour  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:17):**  on probably.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:18):**  Which is a greater obstacle to scaling up regenerative agriculture financing or cultural  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:22):**  slash educational issues like resistance and obviously of doing things differently.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:28):**  It might come as a surprise for somebody that's been running and investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:32):**  agriculture and food podcast but I definitely think it's the second part.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:36):**  Financing it may sound not so easy to hear if you're currently raising financing if you're  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:43):**  running a fund if you're running a farm and you've tried to raise finance but it seems  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:48):**  to be that there's a lot of willingness at least from investors to get active in the  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:52):**  space.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:55):**  Definitely a lot of education needed on the investor side of things and let's actually  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:59):**  get Trudy into the question or into the waiting room because I just saw her joining.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:04):**  So Trudy thanks for joining we're actually just getting to your question.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:08):**  So I definitely think it's the second part and the cultural and the educational part  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:11):**  it's much more of a cultural shift than it is a finance shift.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:16):**  Actually first and foremost a cultural one.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:19):**  Why because on the financing side we need to do a lot of education for a lot of investors  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:24):**  obviously on how soil works how region acts work and the timing the length the flexibility  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:29):**  etc.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:30):**  But that we need to do in general in impact investing and I'm looking to Frank who has  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:34):**  been doing that for the last 25 years.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:37):**  When it comes to the receiving end of the investments there is a lot of work needed  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:44):**  there as well.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:45):**  You have a structural seems to be a structural shortage of good projects to invest in.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:50):**  It sounds horrible again if you're trying to raise money you cannot find anybody now  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:54):**  doesn't mean your product isn't good but it might be that the language you're using it  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:58):**  might be that the investability is not always the same as running a good project and you  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:04):**  should probably also really wonder if you want to raise any outside capital.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:10):**  There are a lot of strings attached that comes with money and many people choose not to raise  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:15):**  outside capital and choose to run it on to grow it on cash flow bootstrap etc. etc.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:20):**  So once you've made that decision to really do you want to raise outside capital there  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:25):**  are certain language things there are certain reporting which are not always easy for farms  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:31):**  because they're very very flexible and there's a great shortage of investable projects funds  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:39):**  farmers companies that are really getting regenerative agriculture to scale.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:43):**  So I would say definitely the greater obstacle is currently the cultural and educational  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:48):**  side of things doesn't mean that we shouldn't do a lot of education on the investor side  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:53):**  of things because my question usually is when is the last time you talked to a farmer or  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:58):**  visited a farm and that could be a while ago or never which makes it very difficult to  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:02):**  run either a family office or a fund or any kind of financial institution that claims  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:07):**  to be focused on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:10):**  Trudy does that answer your question?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:13):**  I muted you.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:17):**  I'm so sorry I missed.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:20):**  I was just explaining the question so you didn't miss any part of the answer I think.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:27):**  Okay okay.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:28):**  So it's I think the bigger shift has to happen on in the on the food company level on the  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:34):**  farm level on all of us as a consumer to really understand that what we believe to be the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:42):**  normal is actually something that we can fundamentally change in a lifetime and that's quite a big  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:48):**  thing to ask from from all of us.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:51):**  And there is the interest in the podcast interest in general in finance these things is growing  
**[0:04:55-0:05:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:55):**  exponentially we did we just crossed a hundred thousand downloads actually two days ago and  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:03):**  seventy five percent of that was last year.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:06):**  So just to see the size of I don't trust the stats too much of SoundCloud honestly but  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:10):**  it gives an idea the interest in the space is exploding and I think it's up to us to  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:16):**  create the structures the infrastructure the pipelines if you want of this space to to  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:23):**  put that energy part of that is money part of that is time part of a lot of people reach  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:27):**  out that they want to work in the space where where our job listings etc. we have to channel  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:32):**  that that energy because we need all of it we need to transition absolutely millions  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:38):**  and millions of farms and with that obviously we need to get farmers on the journey and  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:43):**  that requires all.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:44):**  So the finance I'm less worried about it I'm definitely worried but I'm less worried about  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:49):**  that compared to our outlook towards food and ag.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:56):**  And then we received a second question I'm just going to meet Trudy again which is a  
**[0:06:00-0:06:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:00):**  much more practical one and I'm of Adrian actually and so how does organic farming differ  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:09):**  from regen ag and would the transition from one to the other be relatively straightforward.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:15):**  Again this is one we can probably spend two hours on and there are people on the call  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:18):**  and people I've interviewed that can give a way better answer on this the simple answer  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:25):**  as far as I know again I'm not a farmer and haven't run any regenerative farms at scale  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:29):**  ever.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:30):**  Is that the traditional or the organic systems we know now especially the larger scale more  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:37):**  industrial size are much more they move from a conventional system and they move transition  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:44):**  to intrinsic to an organic one basically swapping inputs and swapping do a certain type of things  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:50):**  not and another basically changing a set of inputs for another set so less chemical less  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:56):**  basically switching the input side of things or the oil that's running the machine but  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:01):**  they didn't really fundamentally change the way they're operating one big example is obviously  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:06):**  plowing which happens a lot against weed pressure which doesn't happen if you're running an  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:11):**  advanced regenerative system so the second part of the question does it make it easier  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:17):**  if you're organic and switching from like could it be a stepping stone I think in terms  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:21):**  of mindset definitely yes and because you are working more with nature and less against  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:27):**  but I've seen many organic systems that are absolutely not regenerative and in some cases  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:30):**  actually more destructive than conventional systems so it it's not either or it's it's  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:37):**  definitely we need to go way beyond of actually the least the industrial size organic we've  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:43):**  lately seen and maybe go back to you at least the principles of the original organic but  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:48):**  obviously take into account that we have made we've seen huge changes in in terms of technology  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:55):**  in terms of understanding of soil in terms of research we're not at the same place where  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:58):**  we were 60 or 70 80 years ago we're in a very different place so it's both a step forward  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:02):**  and backwards Adrian does it I don't see you on the screen but I could that's because we  
**[0:08:07-0:08:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:07):**  have a few and does it answer your question you should be able to unmute yourself where  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:18):**  Adrian maybe he fell off the call anyway we're recording it I will I will let him know I  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:23):**  see Martijn asked a question in the chat the claims of many advocates of Regen Ag seems  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:30):**  to be too good to be true higher yield higher nutrition value and better for the climate  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:35):**  and environment what's the caveat higher costs I agree I think many especially lately we've  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:43):**  seen many many articles written many people basically claiming that Regen Ag is the tool  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:50):**  that will change everything overnight and and obviously soil will solve all the world  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:54):**  problems we can possibly imagine I think the caveat is is that that's simply not true everything  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:00):**  that sounds to be true usually is too good to be true it's not easy it requires a fundamental  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:06):**  shift of how we've been doing agriculture in many cases for a very long time not just  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:11):**  the last 40 years and it's definitely possible to do at least equal we've seen examples now  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:18):**  of equal yields and if you compare it on a crop by crop basis the complex thing obviously  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:23):**  is that many of the Regen Ag and let's say advanced farmers are multi cropping and it's  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:29):**  very difficult to compare to have an honest corn to corn let's say corn to corn research  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:37):**  if you're also doing two or three other crops in the same rotation so the the yield part  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:42):**  we see that the most advanced ones definitely get to the same let's say calories per acre  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:47):**  or per hectare as the conventional ones obviously with a lot less input so profitability is  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:52):**  is a huge driver for many farms to make the shift because many are shifting you see that  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:58):**  very often in Australia and the US because they simply they hit a wall and they cannot  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:02):**  pay for inputs anymore so they go and look for other ways of running running their farms  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:07):**  it's not easy and fast I think the the huge changes happen over time and they're very  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:15):**  very place dependent so almost every region has to figure out what's the most effective  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:21):**  design here to store the most carbon restore the most water or whatever you want that system  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:26):**  to do and it's not easy to incorporate trees into a big arable farm it's not easy to sell  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:34):**  your crops partly directly as many will discover now in our discovering in COVID it's not easy  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:38):**  to figure out things that actually nobody has ever figured out at that scale it's not  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:44):**  easy to find machinery to harvest certain things it's very great to do it on a hectare  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:48):**  where many things you can do by hand but what happens if you have two thousand hectares  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:53):**  what happens if you have twenty thousand what happens if you're super remote and you cannot  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:56):**  sell directly so the easiness I think is the big caveat I would say most of the potential  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:04):**  benefits we still haven't really understood what happens if you do this at scale let's  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:08):**  say a full region a full island I've heard stories about Mallorca and other places like  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:12):**  what happens but actually happens to the climate and but basically the local climate does it  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:17):**  stabilize if you change your mono crop corn field for a multi crop does it and we see  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:23):**  some early results in that but we have only literally scratched the surface so I think  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:27):**  the caveat and Martijn is really it's it's a fundamental shift and we should not kid  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:32):**  ourselves that this is something that all farmers and all consumers will tomorrow knock  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:37):**  on our doors and say of course why didn't I think about this before it's a very fundamental  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:42):**  shift which requires a holistic approach from financing from funding from grant from tools  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:49):**  from machinery from seeds input markets consumers the whole spectrum unfortunately or maybe  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:57):**  fortunately actually does that answer your question I see a nodding on this screen we  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:02):**  can honestly also spend an hour on justice obviously sorry go ahead no it does answer  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:08):**  my question and it seems that that's not maybe not necessarily higher cost but then because  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:13):**  it's not easy higher risks so that there is a there is a price we pay so it's a higher  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:19):**  risk I would I would argue not if you look at the the farmers that have been wiped out  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:25):**  by honestly this year the huge rains in the US where most farmers a lot of farmers in  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:31):**  the Midwest couldn't plant simply they couldn't get on the land because it was too wet so  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:36):**  the real I think we underestimate the risk of the current farming system and it's being  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:42):**  either covered by subsidies covered by crop insurance that is a subsidy covered by other  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:46):**  things so I think we we overestimate the returns and underestimate the risk of the current  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:51):**  system and if you look at the very advanced region farmers they they whether usually a  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:56):**  lot better when their neighbors are really suffering so the risk part I think is actually  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:01):**  very favorable because you're much more resilient and in some cases even you could argue anti-fragile  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:08):**  but it's for another call so I think the risk part is is actually much more interesting  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:12):**  if you are if you're building your biggest asset which is at the end of the soil but  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:20):**  there's a price there's a price which is time there's a price to figure out there's a price  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:23):**  of becoming much more entrepreneurial as a farmer and and going where probably none of  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:28):**  your neighbors and none of the people I've heard stories of people that started to switch  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:32):**  and started in the transition and their children were no longer invited in the soccer team  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:36):**  and things like that so don't underestimate what it means to to go through this and I  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:42):**  think we all we are writing these amazing articles we're recording podcasts in my case  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:46):**  and and we we make it sound like it's a it's a walk in the park and but it's definitely  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:51):**  not so it's it's very easy from from the city to to argue and my my answer is always go  
**[0:13:57-0:14:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:57):**  talk to farmers listen and and probably we all learn a lot okay I want to I saw galaxy  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:07):**  note I don't see your name but you unmuted yourself which probably means you want to  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:10):**  add something or ask something or maybe not I won't mute you Vila I saw you had a question  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:19):**  if you're a beginning investor in region egg are there already European funds out there  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:23):**  to invest in can you describe the landscape of various funds so it my answer is usually  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:30):**  it depends which is not a very satisfying answer they are not so many they're not so  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:34):**  many easy places where you as a either high net worth individual or retail investor or  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:41):**  somewhere in the middle can invest today there are a lot of people working on things but  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:45):**  a lot of people have been frozen obviously in the crazy time we're in and so the answer  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:49):**  is no I and the second part of that answer is it really depends what you would like to  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:56):**  do there are a number of funds that the strongest funds are the funds that have been in the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:00):**  space for the low for the longest time usually in the US and Australia have been funds that  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:05):**  have been buying land and regenerating it and that is a more of an infrastructure play  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:09):**  very similar to renewable energy and those have had a track record and many are raising  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:15):**  the third fund or fourth fund etc and actually raising quite large amounts we can have a  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:19):**  long argument about land ownership and should it be concentrated or not and I think that's  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:23):**  an argument we need to have but those have been the most advanced in the space so far  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:29):**  in terms of funds that help current farmers to transition I've seen three experiments  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:36):**  maybe so far or three experiments are in process some are still under the radar and I think  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:41):**  we're going to see an explosion and that would be very interesting for people to invest in  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:44):**  because then you can invest alongside farmers and as they're going through the transition  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:49):**  without the land having to change ownership and obviously without a lot of money being  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:52):**  tied into the land but there the answer is in Europe I haven't seen anything I've seen  
**[0:15:58-0:16:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:58):**  one crowdfunding platform in France which so far has only been open to French speaking  
**[0:16:07-0:16:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:07):**  called mimosa so m-i-double-i sorry m-o-s-a and they have done small projects they partnered  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:15):**  with Danone and Carrefour to help some of their farmers transition so I'm guessing more  
**[0:16:19-0:16:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:19):**  of that will happen there but so far in Europe at least not an easy place to go please send  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:28):**  me stuff if you've seen things but I have not found too much I'm trying to obviously  
**[0:16:32-0:16:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:32):**  keep keep an eye on the sector and also here as much as possible and from prisca does regenerative  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:42):**  just refer to the environmental aspect of agriculture or can it also apply imply regenerative  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:48):**  processes on social cultural and economic dimensions like fostering community building  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:54):**  I think the clear answer I think it's a personal answer my answer is definitely yes I see it's  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:00):**  very difficult to do regenerative agriculture and not do and not hit a lot of the social  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:06):**  aspects that we would like to see in this world as well I have to get to see an example  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:10):**  where that for instance happened it really depends on the focus of the farmer it focus  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:16):**  on of the fund the focus of the group that's running at the trust etc but almost always  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:22):**  I've seen a very close connection between the environmental and the social and I would  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:27):**  strongly argue that that we should keep it that way because otherwise why are we doing  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:32):**  it and I think there's a very interesting angle if you look at obviously the farm worker  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:39):**  side of things which in some countries is a much bigger issue in some other countries  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:42):**  a much smaller issue and which in most regenerative farms are much better treated farm workers  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:50):**  are much better treated than not but it's definitely something that also the crazy blog  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:55):**  post that it's going to save the world often focus on the carbon the water and the climate  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:00):**  and not so much on the social side of things I think a big potential impact we'll see on  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:06):**  the health care side which obviously is a social part as well when we truly dive deep  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:12):**  into the nutrient density of things and start to to discover which some early research now  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:16):**  is showing that this tomato being grown organically you find in the supermarket or this tomato  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:23):**  grown regeneratively relatively nearby are fundamentally different products and they  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:29):**  have very different nutrient contents and there you get a bit more tying into the too  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:34):**  good to be true area but we're going to see a lot of research coming out that a lot of  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:42):**  the food we thought was full of nutrients is actually quite empty and a lot of the food  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:46):**  that is grown very differently is actually almost medicine so we're going to have that  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:50):**  discussion of food as medicine which is going to sound very weird but it's going to be very  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:54):**  interesting and I think they're the social aspect is very strong in terms of learning  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:58):**  abilities in terms of we are literally what we eat and a lot of there's research on prisons  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:05):**  that when they started to to actually eat feed the prisoners cook the prisoners good  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:09):**  food a lot of the violence went down and things like that so I think we're going to see an  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:13):**  explosion on on food as medicine measurement and really see that connection healthy soil  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:19):**  healthy produce healthy gut systems and healthy people I mean think with your gut probably  
**[0:19:25-0:19:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:25):**  comes obviously from there does it answer your question Prisca I take that as a yes  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:35):**  a Gadi how do you reconnect people and yourself see the concept of hydroponic growth technology  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:41):**  which are at least to some degree a closed circle of water and materials more efficient  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:46):**  controlled very suitable for cities obviously closer to consumers eliminating eliminating  
**[0:19:51-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:51):**  much of the transportation environment and financial costs also here I think it depends  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:59):**  I see a lot of space for hydroponic especially on the leafy green side of things so the salads  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:07):**  the maybe some tomatoes and a lot of those many of them are not as energy efficient as  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:13):**  you would like so I would as an investor I would always ask the question and show me  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:19):**  the full circle like show me how much input it actually takes obviously anything grown  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:24):**  that doesn't need a lot of transportation is something to look at but often in these  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:29):**  systems they they claim a hundred percent closed loop with either fish or something  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:33):**  else but there's always obviously inputs going in because nothing I mean you need some kind  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:38):**  of fertilizer liquids you need something to to grow plants they don't grow out of nothing  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:44):**  especially not in soil not outside soil so I would very much look at the full input and  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:49):**  output like how much energy how much input where is it coming from is that a risk potentially  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:54):**  in pandemics when suddenly a certain fertilizer might not be delivered anymore etc etc etc  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:01):**  and I have done I think maybe one interview on greenhouses and slightly more controlled  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:08):**  environment also because there are huge limitations of how much we can actually grow like how  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:14):**  much of our daily diet can we grow in greenhouses or can we grow inside can we grow in hydroponic  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:19):**  systems and most of our calories come from a few crops unfortunately a weed rise etc  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:26):**  and they also occupy most of our land so if we want to have the impact on carbon on water  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:32):**  on farm workers on a lot of hectares or acres I think we're gonna look mostly actually not  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:39):**  to the vegetables but mostly to tree crops mostly to weed mostly to large broad acre  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:46):**  farms and land because that's what occupies so much of our of our planet unfortunately  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:50):**  obviously largely used for animal feed which is something that fundamentally has to change  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:55):**  so I see a lot of potential there to to reduce all the chemicals to reduce the tillage reduce  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:01):**  the fertilizer and and obviously I applaud any work that's being done in vegetables in  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:07):**  leafy greens but I would really look at the full input and output cycle because there's  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:12):**  there's a lot I see some of these decks and we come back to the two more time and that  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:17):**  really seemed to good be too good to be true like you only put a solar panel and and these  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:21):**  grow basically without inputs and that simply I would argue not possible and so really really  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:28):**  have a deep understanding of that but I think it's part of the puzzle maybe a small part  
**[0:22:33-0:22:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:33):**  but it's definitely part of the puzzle. Thanks again. Alexandra what's most lacking on farm  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:42):**  or farmers before on farm for farmers to required for the transition towards regen from conventional  
**[0:22:47-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:47):**  data is obviously an issue in part that's not available testing soil is extremely difficult  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:58):**  and how to organize enable decision making support for farmers that brings all of the  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:02):**  variables including profitability market access together who's leading in this technology  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:08):**  so she sent two questions let's answer the first one first I think decision making support  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:12):**  is is absolutely crucial there and enormous amount of apps coming on the market that claim  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:17):**  to do that I don't have the answer which one actually works probably it really depends  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:24):**  on the crop types where you are but I do have a few questions I would always ask any of  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:29):**  these companies probably the first one is the last time you talk to a farmer and is  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:34):**  there a farmer on your board like is there actually a representative of the group you  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:39):**  are trying to reach and you'll be surprised you would think all of all of them at least  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:44):**  have a co-founder like you cannot do this without understanding your community of grain  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:48):**  farmers in the Midwest or you cannot do this without understanding your potato growers  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:51):**  in the Netherlands but you'll be surprised how many meaning very very well but come out  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:56):**  of this from we have to digitalize to farmers and and coming out of it from a very we have  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:02):**  to teach them something and we will show them how it's done because they are behind on XYZ  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:08):**  you'll be surprised and our farmers that have bought the latest drones when they came out  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:11):**  and they were 15,000 euros and have an amount of data that you can just not even process  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:16):**  to begin with so there's definitely a huge need to to help farmers decide they have a  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:21):**  very limited amount of time they usually have 40 50 harvest and need to make huge decisions  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:27):**  on very thin margins so I I don't know which ones are going to lead that I think we're  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:31):**  going to see a spectrum of some case farmer led because they much better understand what's  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:36):**  there obviously it's very different than running a tech company but I would be very careful  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:40):**  with a lot of tech companies and see how much they actually understand and are part of the  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:46):**  region egg movement and and obviously in your investment decisions always take into the  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:51):**  take into consideration the investment advice of a few forward-thinking region farmers they  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:58):**  are very good at filtering the noise from from the actually interesting things because  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:04):**  they need to make those decisions every day and so tech is going to be crucial I don't  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:09):**  think we can all imagine what's going to be possible in a number of years and from robotic  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:13):**  to software to making good farmers decisions what to plant where and why which is still  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:18):**  a very underdeveloped piece but it's going to be very difficult to to get a connection  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:24):**  with a large amount large amount of a group farmers big enough to actually make that a  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:28):**  valuable valuable business without obviously taking the data selling it off and and doing  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:34):**  the traditional model which has made farmers very let's say skeptical of outside outsiders  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:41):**  coming in with the latest techno gizmo to help them does it answer your first question  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:46):**  Alexander?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:50):**  In part I think with that one it's a longer conversation that you and I've had to some  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:55):**  degree before yes your second your second question on carbon market potential what are  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:02):**  your views on this how when and who?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:08):**  That's a really good question where we can again spend an hour on how I think most of  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:17):**  the models so far have been or most of the business model so far have been based on models  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:21):**  either Comet Farm or some others I I don't see and those models have been based on a  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:28):**  lot of academic research which has shown in the past to really either very underestimate  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:34):**  or not take into consideration a lot of the carbon parts so I see some some test farms  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:40):**  actually which are profitable or commercial farms that are doing twice the rate of what  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:44):**  Comet Farm predicted in terms of carbon sequestration doesn't mean that they are right it means  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:48):**  that we just don't know and so I think we're going to see a lot of actually on the like  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:56):**  to really try to actually measure it and not based on a model it's going to be very difficult  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:00):**  so that probably answers your when not not tomorrow and but the customers are going to  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:05):**  want to see this customers are going to buy carbon credits a removal credit storage and  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:10):**  I bought them through Nori for instance and I actually have an interview coming out next  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:14):**  week with Nori and not to plug it but they are they're definitely building a piece of  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:19):**  the puzzle there but it's very I think customers at the front runners all of us probably will  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:24):**  buy them because we just want this to happen but later stage where customers are going  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:29):**  to ask for can you actually prove that this has been stored and that this has been stored  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:33):**  over a long time and then hopefully we're going to see the second part of your question  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:38):**  what's the role of agroforestry inclusion in regen farmers and regen farms and we're  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:43):**  going to see hopefully then a raise for okay what's the the fastest sequestration farm  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:49):**  we can design if that's what you want if you want most biomass if you want most produce  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:54):**  if you want most carbon I think we're going to see different models compete and I don't  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:59):**  see why trees are not going to be part of that for all the extra benefits they have  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:03):**  but obviously they have a huge benefit on carbon and so I think as until they are part  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:08):**  of the models or until we're going to measure actual carbon sequestration and actually how  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:11):**  long that's going to be you're going to struggle on that piece but there will be a lot of interest  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:17):**  in the space because people wake up daily for the amount of what we can actually do  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:22):**  in terms of soil management both above ground and underground that the interest for this  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:27):**  is just going to explode again there's going to be a lot of noise and so it's going to  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:30):**  be asking the right questions and who's actually actually farmers first I think also here who  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:35):**  actually includes farmers in the decision making process and in the design process because  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:40):**  at the end of the day you're not going to get millions of farmers to sign up if you  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:44):**  don't really and to actually get them for to commit for 10 or 15 years if you don't  
**[0:28:48-0:28:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:48):**  really build this from the ground up with farmers. Does that answer your second question?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:59):**  Yeah I mean I think consistency of how we measure is obviously a priority issue there  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:04):**  and then secondly how you track credits as we know so why would you go and whose marketplace  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:12):**  why Indigo versus Nori versus whomever everyone's going to compete for this and which customers  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:17):**  are doing it for the sake of branding benefit right now because that's aligned Patagonia  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:24):**  etc there are some that will move there were some that were not how do you ensure that  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:28):**  you double don't double count credits but as you say I'm I share the same thesis of  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:34):**  want to make it happen therefore let's see how to do that.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:38):**  We're very early that's the I think the and there's a big open question will be just carbon  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:44):**  will it be water maybe moving first will it be all three so biodiversity carbon and water  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:50):**  what what what other because we can make a whole list of ecosystem services obviously  
**[0:29:54-0:30:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:54):**  and around that. So I'm going to move to Chloe is there a minimum dimension of the land to  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:02):**  start thinking to switch to region egg? I don't think so I think there's I mean probably  
**[0:30:09-0:30:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:09):**  a square meter is very small but I would say from the farmers I know the principles there  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:19):**  the approaches really differ obviously in terms of context and place could be a small  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:25):**  holder farmer in Ghana could be a large scale farmer in the Midwest but the principles are  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:31):**  always the same which is about ground cover which is about very no or very little disturbance  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:38):**  of the soil which is about complex rotations both in time and in place meaning both obviously  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:44):**  over the years but also in the same place meaning no no monoculture approaches. So the  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:49):**  principles of all these farmers big and small fully organic or somewhere on the way are  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:53):**  usually the same which sort of indicates that it's a set of principles that could be applied  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:57):**  on a soccer field or could be applied on your backyard garden which maybe allows you to  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:04):**  do a lot more things than you would otherwise not be allowed because you basically can do  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:07):**  you can monitor very easily and do a lot of things by hand. So it seems to be all the  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:12):**  way from very intensive small scale permaculture to very extensive thousands of hectares of  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:19):**  agroforestry systems it seems to be scaling quite nicely but it's very context dependent  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:24):**  and that makes it so difficult for funds to operate for things to selling for inputs to  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:30):**  develop because it really really really depends where you are and that makes it very tricky  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:36):**  and also to build companies that could be huge because how many can you really serve  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:41):**  with your input supply how many can you really help in terms of training if your approach  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:47):**  maybe only works in this bio region or so it also challenged a lot of a lot of that  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:55):**  but I don't think but please correct me if I'm wrong that there's necessarily a dimension  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:00):**  small scale or large scale obviously you want to be commercially farming that's a different  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:04):**  discussion but also there depends on context I've seen people very comfortably getting  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:09):**  a family income of a very small plot and I've seen obviously farmers at a huge scale that  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:15):**  are not even that are below the poverty line so it really depends. Frank what does regenerative  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:23):**  farming really implies is it biological food so both of which I think are food for us or  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:30):**  permaculture so it's primarily an approach of it could imply all of these but it's a  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:37):**  primarily approach to a farmer or a landowner or land user to rebuilding soil most of it  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:43):**  are extremely degraded and so it's a set of principles it's a set of approaches to to  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:49):**  build basically soil and that could mean a range of different things could be that you're  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:55):**  applying permaculture I've seen many that are mixing things they are using certain certain  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:59):**  approaches from permaculture they're using certain approaches from organic agriculture  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:03):**  they're using certain approaches from food for us it really depends on the context but  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:07):**  it's keeping the ground covered at all time using complex rotations in time and space  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:14):**  no or very very low depending on the location but usually no tillage and there's an element  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:22):**  of probably at some point integrating livestock into a certain into the rotation but also  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:28):**  that really depends on location so it's a context specific set which I usually say it  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:33):**  goes way beyond organic but the very simple one is to ask your farmer are you building  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:38):**  soil or not and the region farmers is interesting because you usually have a very long discussion  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:43):**  when you first met them meet them not about their produce not about the oranges they grow  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:47):**  not about whatever vegetables they grow but actually about their soil so you can sort  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:52):**  of spot the regenerative farmers because they're more enthusiastic about their soil growing  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:56):**  than the produce which sort of happens to be a byproduct so it's quite interesting I've  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:01):**  seen regenerative livestock so chick actually a chicken operation that I've mainly talked  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:07):**  about grass and only after an hour we somehow got to oh yeah but I'm actually to grow the  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:13):**  grass I'm using this and this and this principles so it's an interesting it's a different mindset  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:19):**  not making it easier or less easy obviously than organic but organic is much more established  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:24):**  in terms of duties this and this and you can be organic and don't do this in terms of regenerative  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:29):**  it's it's a bit more fluid but it all comes down to are you building soil and are you  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:33):**  building soil at least in my case at scale. Willem shared a fund aqua spark which is very  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:39):**  personal to me because I used to work there thank you for sharing that and I mean I think  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:45):**  it triggers an interesting thought in a sense that I've only interviewed one or two I think  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:50):**  but there's a huge space we never cover when we talk about region and which is obviously  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:54):**  the oceans and there's an enormous potential from seaweed farming to mix cropping also  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:01):**  there and I think we we are only just scratching the surface of what is possible when we restore  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:06):**  the oceans and there you can ask exactly the same question to any fish investment or any  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:11):**  ocean investment you might be considering and are you restoring the oceans and if so  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:16):**  how are you measuring it can you report on it and I think the the potential there in  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:20):**  terms of climate in terms of nutrients in terms of fixing runoff issues is probably  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:26):**  maybe even bigger than in all the the land area combined because it's just so much bigger  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:30):**  and it turns out that for instance there's some research coming out in terms of whales  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:34):**  that are sort of the grazers of the the ocean and actually storing an enormous amount of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:39):**  of co2 and and restoring just a whale population would already help a lot so there's a lot  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:45):**  of things and there they see is there on the call in terms of seaweed which she knows much  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:50):**  more about that there's to discover and actually they're very interesting connection between  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:54):**  farms runoff obviously but also farms and and the nearby ocean or the nearby sea in  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:59):**  terms of seaweed which can be used as a fertilizer and and obviously captures a lot of the runoff  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:05):**  seaweed can obviously be eaten and so there's a lot to discover there I'm definitely planning  
**[0:36:09-0:36:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:09):**  to to do more that there also considering my my history at Aquaspark and I see a link  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:17):**  here which I will not click on now William regenerative resources an American organization  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:23):**  looking for funds I will dive into that after can you if I just make sure on the one of  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:31):**  the first question somebody asked what our funds to invest in so these two came on the  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:36):**  top of my mind and that's why I put them in and I think a third one could be common lands  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:41):**  in the Netherlands who also she's an NGO yeah so they're definitely yeah they're definitely  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:47):**  places I would there are a lot of places to to have these discussions but an easy list  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:53):**  their soil wealth which is a big report and if somebody could put them in the chat that  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:57):**  would be great but it's mostly us and a very small percentage of the funds they have listed  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:02):**  are actively many are actively measuring soil health so I would always argue ask for measurement  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:09):**  active measurement of soil health but there's it's definitely growing like every day I had  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:14):**  a discussion two days ago about a group that is launching now if he paused every generative  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:22):**  they call it sustainable but it was for different reasons let's say regenerative public publicly  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:27):**  listed farmland income trust on the long stock exchange won't be listed for the next few  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:34):**  weeks because nothing is listed but that would mean that it's suddenly accessible for retail  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:38):**  investors and and so there's there are a lot of people thinking about vehicles to make  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:42):**  this accessible and start financing this transition thank you for sharing those okay I'm trying  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:50):**  to catch up because otherwise we're never going to get through this I see a question  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:55):**  of Janessa a few of my Californian growers are looking to just quickly scanning it because  
**[0:38:01-0:38:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:01):**  otherwise I'm reading it all so she's asking if there are any advisors consultants that  
**[0:38:12-0:38:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:12):**  could have her Californian growers to switch so there are many many I would quote unquote  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:21):**  gurus in this in this space and many advisors and consultants it hasn't been organized very  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:25):**  well so far that you can easily search and and find who in your crop type area etc is  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:30):**  very good so the answer is I don't know and I know that act talent who are interviewed  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:37):**  is trying to do this mostly for the Australian market but I think we definitely need better  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:42):**  searchable directories etc I'm sure they are there but I haven't seen too many and let's  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:48):**  say these these consultants come recommended lists or something like that so that's actually  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:53):**  an opportunity like we need we need many of these agronomists independent not paid by  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:58):**  the input companies to to help growers and to help cooperatives or to help groups of  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:03):**  farmers to transition actually soil capital but it's very European focused at the moment  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:08):**  is working on on just that to basically build an army of independent agronomists that have  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:14):**  experience in region egg are being trained to to really be even more experienced and  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:19):**  are not paid by the input companies are free to advise and and not basically have to to  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:26):**  sell anything because usually these are normally their salespeople so soil capital is working  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:31):**  on it unfortunately not in California but you might could reach out to them to see if  
**[0:39:36-0:39:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:36):**  they know anybody so Sarah is asking a question where do you see the role of product innovation  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:45):**  currently work I'm working on algae based soil regeneration and drought mitigation are  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:49):**  these opportunities out there for early stage innovations do you know any farmers groups  
**[0:39:53-0:40:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:53):**  or organizations in Europe who want to co-create I'm not a techie I'm a permaculture gardener  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:02):**  so that's a good question there are many far how do you would find you you're basically  
**[0:40:08-0:40:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:08):**  asking what are what could be early adopters of the work you're doing yeah basically so  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:18):**  I mean I actually see great connection with what you just mentioned actually connecting  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:22):**  aquaculture with agriculture so that that's one of my main points that I'm working on  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:26):**  actually connecting the blue and green so we're really concretely now in product innovation  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:33):**  and since it's quite a new field to actually connect this aquaculture and agriculture I'm  
**[0:40:39-0:40:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:39):**  not quite sure where to look in terms of finding co-creators or funders I'm looking at the  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:47):**  more general like sustainability fellowships and things like that but I'm wondering if  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:52):**  there's anyone out there that maybe we could think of partnering with or you know go a  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:56):**  little bit deeper into this innovation together yeah I think what it really depends where  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:02):**  you are but you're you're based in in Western Europe right yeah yeah so it would definitely  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:08):**  in this case in the Netherlands find groups like common land or find groups of farmers  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:13):**  of violent that are already at least somewhere in the transition and to to test sorry to  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:19):**  test with them I know a number of farmers that actually have used also in an island  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:22):**  seaweed as fertilizer or are also using it obviously as a livestock feed ingredient which  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:29):**  greatly reduce the methane so it's it's finding those groups of farmers could be the research  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:34):**  actually yeah so finding those groups of early adopters that are willing to donate or make  
**[0:41:41-0:41:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:41):**  available one or two hectares just to try a few things and yes it's the the common land  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:50):**  project just north of Amsterdam okay with a big group of farmers so they are definitely  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:57):**  let's say on the front end of this plus a lot of the farmers they would know all the  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:00):**  other farmers in Europe or in in the Netherlands as well that are potentially open to this  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:04):**  really interesting can I can ask you one more question but you want to go down the list  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:11):**  and that's kind of more the dilemma is what the target group you're focusing on is it  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:16):**  the farmers that are already doing well that are already really deep into regenerative  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:20):**  farming or should you actually also be targeting the mainstream you're just beginning the transition  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:26):**  what's your view personal and with you you mean you as a seaweed project or me no you  
**[0:42:33-0:42:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:33):**  what's your personal view on it for me I've very similar to my view and impact investing  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:42):**  I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people certain things I don't think that's  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:46):**  very effective so I decided to focus on the front runners and to focus on on people that  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:53):**  I'm always happy to share something on soil obviously but to to help the front runners  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:58):**  to to go faster and to do more because I think we're gonna see more change faster if we had  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:02):**  a hundred years I wouldn't be too worried and because most farmers will at some point  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:08):**  discover and we'll start focusing on soil will go deep into YouTube and find gay Brown  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:13):**  and others and start learning and will be fine but we have 10-15 years so convincing  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:19):**  is going to take at least in my personal view too long and so we either incentivize through  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:24):**  carbon payments of take agreements and other or we partner with with the front runners  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:30):**  to to move faster and communicate about it so we obviously create more front runners  
**[0:43:36-0:43:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:36):**  otherwise thanks and let's go down the list because otherwise take Lana do you see big  
**[0:43:46-0:43:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:46):**  opportunities in ocean yes I think we already answered that so let's keep moving Sam and  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:54):**  the director of main stats down which is an urban farm in Amsterdam region egg principles  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:00):**  we're looking for investments mainly for a center of excellence on region farming and  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:05):**  what would be the most efficient way to find investments it's a very difficult question  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:12):**  because obviously the answer is it depends I would argue mostly for any type of investments  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:21):**  like this which is an urban farm located in Amsterdam to try to find it as much as possible  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:26):**  locally you need people with a connection locally I mean it's one thing if you're in  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:30):**  the middle of nowhere in the center of France and maybe locally there's not so much capital  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:35):**  around but in this case you're in Amsterdam which is obviously one of the financial centers  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:40):**  of of Europe and I would really try to find people with a connection to this space and  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:46):**  try to figure out if you're honestly looking for an investment or a grant or a mix and  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:51):**  get first of all very very clear what you're looking for and why because it's the first  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:55):**  question any funder or investor will ask and then really search for a local connection  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:01):**  because you're going to need that to to compete with any other investment decks etc that investors  
**[0:45:07-0:45:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:07):**  are going to get does it answer your question Sam I saw you unmuted I'm unmuted right now  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:15):**  yes of course I also understand that it is a hard question to answer but still thanks  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:22):**  for your reply and I totally agree with you I get really really clear what you need it  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:28):**  for and why because maybe you don't and and smart investors will will see through that  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:33):**  immediately I see many people to say I am gonna raise capital I need to raise capital  
**[0:45:37-0:45:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:37):**  after two or three questions of why why why probably it's not the case or probably they  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:44):**  don't need it or there are other ways to to raise capital or to to grow and scale yeah  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:49):**  that's a valid answer and also so true I would love to talk longer about this but please  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:56):**  continue with the other questions thank you so much thanks Jeff the publicly listed company  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:03):**  it's not publicly listed they were supposed to learn I'm looking at the month ago which  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:08):**  obviously got shelved so I hope to do an interview anytime soon they are thinking about some  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:13):**  where this year so no listed yet you can search but I don't think you will find it at maybe  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:19):**  I mean they're public but they are not publicly listed yet then we get to villain there is  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:27):**  a list of concert consultants I will look into that out dot initiative so for consultants  
**[0:46:32-0:46:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:32):**  Janessa villain put something in there in the chat box if you want to have a look Alexandra  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:39):**  John Kempf definitely interesting to speak with I had him on the phone yesterday actually  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:44):**  very interesting guy John Kempf a very interesting podcast for anybody interested in podcasts  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:48):**  otherwise you're not here and his company is called advancing eco agriculture and they  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:54):**  do a lot of work also in California so I cannot I haven't worked with him in terms of as a  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:00):**  consultant so I cannot as a farmer but definitely somebody to to reach out to Chuck also in  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:07):**  has been on the podcast of so capital knows him well and yeah we actually met in Oakland  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:11):**  at the investment the regenerative food system investment for so that thank you Alexandra  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:17):**  for sharing that interesting podcast they share a lot they share a lot of webinars they  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:21):**  share a lot of information and that's actually the list so if anybody has another question  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:27):**  please unmute yourself oh there's another one yours can you sketch several scenarios  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:33):**  of how a transition to region and could look like in terms of time and yours can you unmute  
**[0:47:41-0:47:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:41):**  yourself and maybe so I'm I'm very new to this I don't know a lot about region agriculture  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:50):**  in general but I was just interested in how like a transition on a large scale would look  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:57):**  like in like how can you if you put in a certain amount of investment in a certain area like  
**[0:48:03-0:48:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:03):**  if you have this knowledge base set up for like convincing farmers to switch more to  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:11):**  regenerative farming basically having the science back up for convincing people how  
**[0:48:18-0:48:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:18):**  that speed up farmers and or how would that impact the world in terms of co2 yeah sure  
**[0:48:26-0:48:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:26):**  so I wouldn't be doing this I didn't think it would make a considerable carbon difference  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:33):**  in the next 10 to 15 years because that's probably pretty much the window we have that  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:41):**  answer is again it really depends on on the farm and the location we we've seen or I've  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:47):**  seen changes especially if you have it also depends on the climate obviously stuff grows  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:53):**  a lot faster in tropics where things happen a lot faster so if you're looking for the  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:57):**  fastest growth of soil or biomass of anything definitely pick the climate to do that the  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:03):**  climate is extremely important to that but if you're looking for the most degraded soils  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:08):**  you probably get to the areas which has been farmed the longest and so if you want to the  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:12):**  biggest bang for your buck probably you will look at heavily degraded soil that have been  
**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:18):**  in conventional chemical driven agriculture for the longest and bring in quite a bit of  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:25):**  biomass which is a lot of compost and and start to figure out okay what's the quickest  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:29):**  one I want to do but it really depends if you need to live of the cash flow during that  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:33):**  transition obviously you make smaller steps if you have a 10-year window or a five-year  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:38):**  window you don't need any cash flow out of the business and you can also do certain things  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:42):**  that otherwise you can't so it can go quite fast you've seen we've seen changes in produce  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:47):**  in levels of zinc etc in one or two seasons and from changing management practices but  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:53):**  to really build up trees to build up advanced agroforestry systems especially not in the  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:58):**  tropics you need seven to ten years because it takes time for the trees to grow we can  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:03):**  speed it up in a lot of ways by changing the tree planting methods by selecting other types  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:08):**  etc so it's both fast and slow and really depending on the location but I think you  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:14):**  would be surprised if you visit the most advanced one how fast things can go if we get the right  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:20):**  processes mostly in systems in place but it's a lot of knowledge that we're developing now  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:24):**  in terms of what's actually the speed of things we can do and and it's constantly surprised  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:29):**  me of how fast things are but it if you have a typical grain field and you're going to  
**[0:50:35-0:50:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:35):**  switch to a 10-year rotation and you're bringing in five or ten types of cover crops it will  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:42):**  take a bit of time before the soil starts to recover from from all the chemicals and  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:46):**  starts to actually slowly live again that might take three to five years just to get  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:51):**  through the the shock of less fertilizer and to get through the shock of less and less  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:56):**  chemicals so it really depends what you start with if you want to have the fastest carbon  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:00):**  it usually ends up being like Alex Runder mentioned some kind of system with trees involved  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:06):**  and you need fast growing species in a mix with others etc does that answer your question  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:11):**  thank you  
**[0:51:12-0:51:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:12):**  I see Julie sent another question by email which I'm not going to check now so I will  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:22):**  get back to that there is a farmland read which I'm also not going to click on it but  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:29):**  thank you for for sharing I will have a look not sure if they have a strong region ag focus  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:35):**  usually when they don't mention anything they don't but it's I'm always happy to be to be  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:39):**  surprised obviously and Martijn is asking what budget would be required to set up a  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:44):**  large-scale region farm in the Netherlands and what would be reasonable annual return  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:49):**  expectations that's a question I really don't know I know that I think the average hectare  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:55):**  costs are about 80 to 90,000 so it depends what you mean by large scale but that's if  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:00):**  you want to buy land that's pretty much what you're looking at and then you need still  
**[0:52:06-0:52:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:06):**  the capital on top of that to to really start making investments I'm seeing in terms of  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:13):**  annual return that's maybe some I see some funds now or vehicles that were being set  
**[0:52:18-0:52:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:18):**  up in the US and they're targeting let's say 8 to 12 percent on an annual basis which is  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:25):**  partly coming from the produce partly from the the asset growing in or getting a higher  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:31):**  valuation so those are the numbers they are looking at and they're raising capital which  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:35):**  seems that investors are liking that and what that would mean in the Netherlands I don't  
**[0:52:39-0:52:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:39):**  know because I don't think anybody has done that and you'll be figuring out what are the  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:45):**  offtake agreements needed who's buying is somebody buying the carbon which obviously  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:49):**  influences your return quite a bit because it's free extra cash are you going for a 10-year  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:56):**  system which means you involve a lot of trees which means you have to wait do you need to  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:59):**  live with the cash flow it's an interesting exercise I think some people in the Netherlands  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:04):**  would be would be interested to to look at that it really depends on large scale if you're  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:08):**  buying land a lot of your money will be locked into buying the land and that just limits  
**[0:53:14-0:53:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:14):**  what you can do that's one of the reasons I'm not focusing only for instance on large  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:19):**  funds that are raising capital to buy land because I think there's a limit of how much  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:23):**  money there's available to to get into those funds even if they raise 10 billion etc how  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:28):**  much actual land can we buy and thus influence with that is limited and if you look at systems  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:34):**  or processes or vehicles that are working with farmers this potential to scale is much  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:38):**  higher because you don't need to buy the land and you don't have obviously the whole discussion  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:43):**  on land ownership so there's definitely there's a lot of learnings in these large funds because  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:47):**  they operate at a large scale but I think there's also sort of natural limit of how  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:51):**  much they can actually raise and how much hectares and acres we can influence with that  
**[0:53:56-0:53:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:56):**  but we need them I think in terms of lessons learned we need them in terms of co2 now we  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:59):**  need them in terms of of large offtake agreements there's there's a lot of people going to be  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:04):**  trained on those farms to do this at scale which is absolutely essential because we don't  
**[0:54:07-0:54:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:07):**  have enough farmers that are able to do this multi cropping very complex rotations of 15  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:15):**  types of cover crops mixing in with etc etc they're not let many people that can do that  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:20):**  at and want to do that honestly at remote locations etc so I think a lot of the capital  
**[0:54:25-0:54:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:25):**  will be locked into the land which is maybe something to consider if you want to have  
**[0:54:27-0:54:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:27):**  the most impact Anastasia hello from Greece we grow cherries and figs if anybody or anyone  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:37):**  is interested let's connect so definitely anybody that's interested in cherries and  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:40):**  figs maybe from mediterranean countries and please connect with Anastasia Alexandra is  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:46):**  a longer conversation which is interesting because we're on top of the hour the investment  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:52):**  thesis for rewilding very interesting question as one of the most listened episodes definitely  
**[0:54:57-0:55:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:57):**  read the book if you haven't isabella tree obviously she's called tree fascinating book  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:02):**  anything you thought anything I thought at least about nature was being debunked I think  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:07):**  15 times in the book alone and thought about rewilding management how much do you have  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:13):**  to do and how much you cannot do how fast can nature come back so it comes back to your  
**[0:55:17-0:55:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:17):**  question yours I think there's a very interesting case of integrating rewilding into rotations  
**[0:55:24-0:55:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:24):**  so there are two cases I think there's a very interesting to integrate rewilding into rotations  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:27):**  what would happen if you managed rewilding so it's not just putting a fence and wait  
**[0:55:33-0:55:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:33):**  and but actually manage the process and integrate certain things and actually speed up the process  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:38):**  of rewilding what if that will be part of a 20-year rotation so you have a 20-year rewilding  
**[0:55:43-0:55:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:43):**  and then you go back to regenerative AG for a few years and you go back to you so you  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:46):**  sort of move in and out what would that mean for nutrient levels I think that's a very  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:50):**  interesting like what what would the produce do when it comes off the land and I think  
**[0:55:54-0:55:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:54):**  it's the second part and we talked a bit about that in the interview is how do you integrate  
**[0:55:58-0:56:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:58):**  this into farms in into pieces that are not extremely productive how do you rewild pieces  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:04):**  of your farm of your operation that are anyway not the most economically profitable pieces  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:10):**  and how can you manage that actively to let biodiversity simply explode and and I think  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:16):**  Isabella and her husband Charlie have shown that you can actually go on safari in and  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:21):**  just just south of London and see an amount of biodiversity that if somebody said that  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:26):**  20 years ago and that that would grow there and say they have more nightingales than most  
**[0:56:30-0:56:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:30):**  of the wildlife areas nearby and so it's it's it challenges a lot of our thought about how  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:39):**  an area should look like in terms of forest versus open canopy oak trees large animals  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:45):**  many many insects and so I think there's a huge role so far they're mostly two different  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:50):**  worlds so that we're not really talking the region egg people and the rewilding people  
**[0:56:54-0:56:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:54):**  are not really talking I think that's a huge mistake because we're after the same things  
**[0:56:58-0:57:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:58):**  and I think there's a lot of integration and that can happen  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:05):**  Trudy so actually Sam sent a message to Martijn and which Martijn can answer what do you think  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:10):**  about large-scale Trudy can you say more about funding that it takes for the ownership of  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:15):**  land versus the funding that supports the farmers and owners to transition to reid and  
**[0:57:18-0:57:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:18):**  egg and is funding that it takes for the ownership a bad deal for the farmer here it really depends  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:24):**  on what the farmer wants to do in the farmer family I've seen examples in Canada and I  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:29):**  just want to say so we're on top of the hour if anybody wants to leave obviously feel free  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:32):**  also before I will finish these questions and which might mean that we're around 10  
**[0:57:37-0:57:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:37):**  minutes over or something and but feel free to to jump to your next call jump to a coffee  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:43):**  or tea wherever you are but I will try to finish these questions and then call it a  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:48):**  day can you say something about the funding what she asked so I've seen examples of people  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:53):**  taking outside capital to buy land of their neighbors and then slowly growing into that  
**[0:57:57-0:58:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:57):**  in Canada I've seen examples of so there are many many flavors I think it really depends  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:03):**  what the farmer wants to do if a comfortable size is what they already have there's no  
**[0:58:09-0:58:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:09):**  need to buy other land if it's more comfortable on the long term to have the land in a trust  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:16):**  which is governed by a certain set of principles and then the farmer leases the land to a certain  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:22):**  certain long period I mean there's so many shapes and forms available there I don't I  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:27):**  think there's a larger discussion we need to have on land ownership and and does it  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:31):**  make sense to have that in a very concentrated group of people but that's part of the region  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:37):**  egg discussion as well and I think we're going to have a lot of different shapes and forms  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:41):**  of trust of farms buying other farms of groups of people getting together forming a cooperative  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:47):**  and buying large farms for for their food etc etc so I don't see I think the impact  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:53):**  is going to be working with current farmers simply because they already have the land  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:57):**  and they need to transition and the largest the fastest the hectares we can do are probably  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:03):**  from partnering with current farmers and land owners because they could be also investment  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:08):**  funds that already have the land but don't know what to do or don't know how to they're  
**[0:59:12-0:59:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:12):**  probably underperforming what they could do there there somebody nicely set underperforming  
**[0:59:17-0:59:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:17):**  landscapes which for investors should be should be quite interesting.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:23):**  Alexandra is asking how important is certification that's an open question I have no idea I see  
**[0:59:29-0:59:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:29):**  obviously Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's and Rodale working in ROC regenerative organic  
**[0:59:35-0:59:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:35):**  certification which is interesting and raises a million and a half questions I really don't  
**[0:59:42-0:59:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:42):**  know I think it really depends on if consumers need certification or if we're going and or  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:50):**  we're going down a nutrient density route and so if we're going down a nutrient density  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:54):**  route and we're going to communicate on what's actually in your food maybe certification  
**[1:00:00-1:00:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:00):**  isn't needed anymore but I don't know I think time will only tell sorry not not a very satisfying  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:07):**  answer I know.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:08):**  Augusto do you believe the lack of wealthy accepted ESG frameworks to evaluate farming  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:12):**  investments remain a key roadblock?  
**[1:00:18-1:00:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:18):**  I think that the lack of accepted ESG is a key roadblock for for anything in impact investing  
**[1:00:26-1:00:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:26):**  so also in regenerative agriculture I think the savory certification from is based on  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:35):**  outcome which is very interesting Rodale ROC is still very early but also very interesting  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:41):**  so time will tell I think it's the same same answer to to Alexander's question we can only  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:46):**  we can only wait and and get involved as investors practitioners farmers to make sure we shape  
**[1:00:51-1:00:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:51):**  these to to something that serves all of us and not just certification bodies not just  
**[1:00:58-1:01:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:58):**  consumers but actually obviously farmers and get all stakeholders on here.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:05):**  Does the EU common agriculture policy encourage region egg?  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:08):**  At the moment not or very very little there's a lot of work and lobbying being done to try  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:13):**  to change that and actually on the so at the moment it's not extremely helpful and I think  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:19):**  you can ask 20 farmers and most of them will tell you that a lot of the legislation a lot  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:25):**  of the subsidy schemes are actually against a lot of these things because they pay you  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:30):**  to plow or they pay you to do certain practices which have been outdated for already 20 years  
**[1:01:35-1:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:35):**  and so for the moment not I know there's a lot of work being done by a number of European  
**[1:01:40-1:01:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:40):**  bodies to change that but of course there's an enormous lobby effort from the mostly the  
**[1:01:44-1:01:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:44):**  input companies because that's what they are depending on and which is their livelihood  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:49):**  so we're going to see the same kind of lobbying we see with fossil fuel it's a very similar  
**[1:01:53-1:02:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:53):**  probably using the same lobby groups actually to do that.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:00):**  Thank you Sarah for sharing the book and I think that's it I reached the end of the questions  
**[1:02:10-1:02:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:10):**  thank you so much for if anybody has a question definitely unmute now and otherwise we'll  
**[1:02:16-1:02:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:16):**  call it a day and I will do this another time soon I hope it was interesting relevant and  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:23):**  have a nice evening nice morning wherever you you are or a nice night actually if you're  
**[1:02:28-1:02:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:28):**  in Singapore because I know some called it.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:33):**  Thank you so much.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:40):**  Dear friends of the podcast I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:02:45-1:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:45):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:49):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:53):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:02:54-1:02:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:54):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:02:58-1:03:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:58):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:03):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned  
**[1:03:08-1:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:08):**  what have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision-making  
**[1:03:12-1:03:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:12):**  framework what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:19):**  should you ask what is happening in the space what should you read what should you listen  
**[1:03:23-1:03:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:23):**  what should you watch how to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil  
**[1:03:29-1:03:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:29):**  builders and investors in this space the soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:34):**  farmers fund managers vehicle builders crowd investing platform builders egg tech companies  
**[1:03:39-1:03:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:39):**  farm to gut food companies permaculture key line designers holistic management consultants  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:45):**  etc etc people that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own  
**[1:03:50-1:03:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:50):**  money to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are  
**[1:03:54-1:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:54):**  putting other people's money to work through foundations institutional capital banks insurance  
**[1:03:59-1:04:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:59):**  companies etc is this course free no this is pay what you think it's worth meaning I  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:05):**  have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware that among  
**[1:04:11-1:04:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:11):**  the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means so I'm inviting  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:15):**  you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to consider paying  
**[1:04:21-1:04:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:21):**  what you think it's worth thank you so what is this course it's currently a series of  
**[1:04:26-1:04:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:26):**  seventeen videos mostly ranging from ten to fifteen minutes plus PDF slides so you don't  
**[1:04:32-1:04:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:32):**  have to ride along we're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why  
**[1:04:37-1:04:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:37):**  extractive agriculture is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and

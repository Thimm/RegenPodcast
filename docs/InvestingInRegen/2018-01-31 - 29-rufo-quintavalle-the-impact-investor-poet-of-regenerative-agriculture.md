**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:32):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:37):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:48):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:00:59):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:06):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:10):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:14):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:18):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:22):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.

**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:52):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:53):**  Today I'm talking to Rufo Quintavalle.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:01:55):**  Rufo is a writer, entrepreneur and impact investor.

**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:02):**  investing in renewable energy, farmland and forestry.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome Rufo.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:06):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:07):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:08):**  So just to have a bit of a background story on your story and how did you end up in forestry  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:12):**  and farmland.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:14):**  Could you share a bit, why are you doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:18):**  Yeah, sure, with pleasure.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:20):**  I have family money which comes from my grandfather who made his money in the car industry essentially.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:35):**  When I came into that inheritance to begin with it was not particularly something that  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:40):**  interested me, money, but about ten years ago and I think it's probably to do with having  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:48):**  children of my own actually.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:51):**  I started getting a sense that this money was something that actually did matter, that  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:02:55):**  I was taking care of it on behalf of somebody else and that if I wanted to be serious about  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:00):**  how it was invested for my children but also for my own peace of mind I needed to find  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:07):**  some kind of coherence between my values as a person and the fact that you know the pure  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:12):**  chance, the pure good chance that I happen to have money and it's a luxury that very  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:18):**  few people have.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:20):**  So about ten years ago I started looking for ways to invest environmentally which initially  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:27):**  meant renewable energy and after doing that for a few years I sort of stopped and said  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:34):**  well what do I really want to be doing if I'm going to be serious about this, how do  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:38):**  I become a more strategic and a more coherent and a more serious investor and the process  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:46):**  I went through was to not think about money at all and just to think about what mattered  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:50):**  to me as a person.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:03:52):**  This may sound slightly silly but I like food so I just sort of thought well look I like  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:00):**  food, where does food come from?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:02):**  Food comes from farming, why not see if there's a way to invest into food and farming?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:08):**  And this happened to be round about the time when a lot of people were getting panicked  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:14):**  by what was going on in conventional financial markets after the sort of meltdown in 2008.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:21):**  So there was interest in investing into farmland at the time as an uncorrelated real asset  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:27):**  and you know a sort of safe place to store your money and to conserve your wealth.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:33):**  So there was farmland was kind of there in the air, there was a sort of a buzz around  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:38):**  it not necessarily coming from green or environmental investors but coming from the sort of more  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:46):**  conventional finance space.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:48):**  I wanted to do it in an environmentally respectful way so to invest into organic farmland.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:04:55):**  So that's how farming came about partly just from that process of personal reflection,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:01):**  partly for financial reasons and partly as a way to suck carbon out of the atmosphere  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:11):**  and get it in the ground which is a vital part of the climate equation.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:18):**  And forestry a few years after that seemed like a natural next step for me and there's  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:24):**  a lot of overlap between the two as well.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:26):**  And in terms of do you still remember finding your first investment and how that was like  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:32):**  to put money into something to put money to work according to your values.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:39):**  Of course renewable energy was also your values but less of a personal connection to it.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:42):**  How was that first investment?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:43):**  I mean the first investing into renewable energy I just kind of to be honest I just  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:48):**  sort of rushed into one of the first things that came my way.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:52):**  I was a little bit too hasty you know I wanted to go out there and do good in the world and  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:05:56):**  in retrospect I was too hasty but at the same time I think sometimes one can spend too long  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:04):**  waiting as well and you wait and wait and wait for the perfect investment.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:07):**  So it's quite good sometimes to get your feet in the water you know don't put in more than  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:13):**  you can afford to lose but sometimes it's good to make that first jump.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:19):**  Investing into farmland I was more you know I learned from that first experience and went  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:25):**  a little bit more slowly and did a bit more research but it felt good.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:30):**  It felt like yeah it felt like the right thing to be doing so if there's anyone out there  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:34):**  listening to this you know contemplating making that leap don't be too hasty but don't be  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:40):**  too slow either you know set aside a bit of money you can afford to potentially lose and  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:46):**  put it to work and I always feel that if think about how you would feel if you do lose that  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:51):**  money and to me that's almost the definition of what an impact investment is because it  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:06:56):**  will mean different things to different people but if you lose the money and you feel I'm  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:01):**  okay with that you know I tried to do something worthwhile and it failed to me that's almost  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:06):**  the definition of an impact investment and if you lose the money and you're angry and  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:11):**  bitter then it probably wasn't an impact investment to begin with.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:15):**  And what was that first one in farmland or in forestry?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:19):**  Is it something you want to share and is it something you're still happy about?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:24):**  Yeah I mean I ended up making two related investments one which was into an asset management  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:32):**  firm called Agro Ecological Investment Management that's based in New Zealand which is where  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:40):**  my mother is from so there was a kind of personal connection there but that's a company that  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:46):**  buys conventional farmland and converts it into organic management so I made an investment  
**[0:07:54-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:07:54):**  into the asset manager itself and I also acquired subsequently acquired a farm in New Zealand  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:04):**  myself so it was two related investments.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:09):**  And since then how many years ago was that?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:12):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:16):**  More or less obviously.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:19):**  Maybe six or seven years ago something like that.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:22):**  And how has the journey been since then from like six seven years ago to now we're talking  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:28):**  December 2017?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:31):**  I think there's more I mean I've since started investing into forestry and agroforestry in  
**[0:08:37-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:37):**  Brazil so you know very different geography going from one of the most safe and stable  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:46):**  and least corrupt countries in the world into a country that you know is almost the opposite  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:08:52):**  so the journey but that's good you know you go slowly and you get experience and go as  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:00):**  fast as you're comfortable going but no the journey has been good and I've learned a great  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:05):**  deal and I mean that's something I would say as well to anyone who's interested in doing  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:08):**  this go out and educate yourself and attend conferences and speak to people and learn  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:14):**  from their expertise.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:16):**  Don't waste people's time you know don't sort of set up endless calls if you've got absolutely  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:20):**  no intention of investing but you know be courteous to learn from people's expertise  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:26):**  and it's been a really nice experience because there's people are happy to share and people  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:33):**  are happy to talk and you can you can learn a great deal that way so no the experience  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:39):**  has been good I think there's more appetite as I say there was a certain kind of interest  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:46):**  in investing into real assets starting post 2008 I think there's maybe more interest now  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:09:54):**  coming from the environmental community who realize the importance of sequestering atmospheric  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:00):**  carbon it's not just about reducing our emissions so that's nice to see as well there's a bit  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:06):**  more a bit more action a bit more action now.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:11):**  And in terms of Brazil can you explain a bit more about that project those investments  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:17):**  or that investment and how you went from transitional funds to from conventional to organic to agroforestry  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:27):**  to perennial systems basically.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:29):**  Yeah yeah I mean to begin with I thought well I've ticked my my agriculture box how am I  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:35):**  going to tick my forestry box so like I said I went to conferences I read up I met people  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:42):**  and tried to educate myself so I wasn't necessarily looking to get into agroforestry to begin  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:47):**  with but it kind of it kind of ended up that way I have two two projects in Brazil one  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:10:55):**  which is in southern Brazil near Sao Paulo which is a mixed a mixed use property so it's  
**[0:11:02-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:02):**  part the native rainforest and partly commercial timber so the idea there is to is to generate  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:11):**  enough money via commercial activities so a mix of timber harvesting and and agricultural  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:17):**  activities and to use that money to permanently preserve the area of native rainforest which  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:24):**  I think ultimately will have more more value.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:28):**  We don't really know what this is the Atlantic rainforest in the south of Brazil which unfortunately  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:34):**  has been almost entirely destroyed.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:36):**  There's only only 7 percent of the original forest cover left but we don't know what's  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:43):**  in the what's in the rainforest.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:46):**  So you know one of the first things that we're doing on that on that particular project is  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:51):**  to start cataloging the plants that are there in this parcel of rainforests or using it  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:11:55):**  as a kind of laboratory to figure out what we've got and then you know the next step  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:01):**  to say well can any of this be of use whether it's as food or medicine or cosmetics or even  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:08):**  for industrial industrial use.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:13):**  So that's the goal there is first to get enough money coming in to preserve this area of native  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:18):**  rainforest second to start getting a sense of what's there in the rainforest and third  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:24):**  to see if any of those native crops can be planted and can be cultivated commercially.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:31):**  Well then you have an incentive not just for us but for other people to go out and get  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:36):**  into reforestation.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:40):**  Everyone you know everyone wants to plant trees everyone wants to save the rainforest  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:44):**  but ultimately there needs to be some kind of commercial driver if people are going to  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:49):**  start doing this on a large scale.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:51):**  So that's the thinking behind that project down south and then recently with some friends  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:12:59):**  of mine with a group of other investors we acquired some land way up north in a state  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:07):**  called Amapa which is on the eastern eastern edge of the Amazon and this is degraded land  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:12):**  so it's land that was originally a mix of rainforest and savannah but which has unfortunately  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:19):**  been cleared and quite severely burnt.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:24):**  So the dynamic there is a bit different it's to start replanting and to plant a mix of  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:31):**  trees some of which are sort of quite fast growing fruit trees will have a first partial  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:36):**  harvest after two or three years some are slightly slower growing fruit trees which  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:41):**  will come to maturity around about five or six years and some of it will be very slow  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:45):**  maturing timber and so to have different revenue streams.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:51):**  And again my broader sort of ambition there if this works is to say look there are viable  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:13:58):**  models for reforestation it's possible to plant trees and to make money and one of the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:05):**  advantages about Brazil is that things do grow very quickly there so you can have a  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:08):**  return on investment relatively quickly you don't need to lock up your money for 10 or  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:14):**  20 years which can be off-putting to many investors.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:20):**  Which makes it very interesting but and again I think the Atlantic rainforest also has an  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:27):**  enormous value but probably not yet in dollar amounts or euro amounts to play with the agricultural  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:35):**  land in the rest of Latin America they are sort of the water pump for the rest of the  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:39):**  space there right?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:41):**  The Amazon rainforest works as a water pump the Atlantic rainforest unfortunately there's  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:47):**  so little left but it doesn't really do much.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:50):**  So the water pump is really demolished and isn't there anymore?  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:14:56):**  Down south I mean you know this is the part the southern part of Brazil is the part that  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:00):**  has seen the most industrialization it's where all the big cities are and it's where a lot  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:06):**  of the agriculture has been historically installed.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:13):**  So unfortunately the Atlantic rainforest it's 7% of the original cover is not a lot you  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:21):**  know so to me the challenge there would be well how does one sort of join up the little  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:24):**  pockets to the left how do you create ecological corridors to try and join up this very fragmented  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:30):**  landscape.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:31):**  The Amazon which is much better conserved does serve this function as a water pump for  
**[0:15:39-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:39):**  the whole of Latin America so that water evaporates from the Amazon it heads westward those clouds  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:49):**  hit the Andes and then turn south they go south and they rain onto southern Brazil and  
**[0:15:57-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:15:57):**  Uruguay and parts of Argentina so the rainfall patterns in that part of Latin America are  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:06):**  totally dependent on what's known as the flying rivers that are generated by the Amazon rainforest  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:14):**  and there's actually more water in those flying rivers than there is in the Amazon River itself.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:22):**  It's 200 million people living in Brazil you add in big places like Buenos Aires and Montevideo  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:32):**  the consequences of disrupting those patterns of rainfall are extremely serious so there's  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:38):**  an intrinsic value in terms of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:43):**  There's also a very practical human cost if we don't reverse the process of deforestation  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:52):**  and start replanting trees there's a risk that the Amazon will tip from its current  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:16:57):**  state as a forest and will tip into a new equilibrium as savannah or grassland which  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:04):**  would have catastrophic consequences for large parts of Latin America.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:12):**  That's why you're piloting these ways of reforestation in severely degraded land.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:20):**  Absolutely, just to try and prove that it can be done and to encourage other people  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:27):**  to do likewise.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:28):**  There's a need to preserve what is left of these big forest basins whether it's the Amazon  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:36):**  whether it's in the Congo or whether it's in Indonesia.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:40):**  We need to preserve as much as we can.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:42):**  There's a need to be replanting as well and realistically that replanting isn't going  
**[0:17:48-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:48):**  to take the form of recreating what looks like a pristine rainforest which is an interesting  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:17:59):**  philosophical question anyway.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:00):**  What is a pristine rainforest given that people have been living in these places for 10,000  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:05):**  years?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:06):**  But anyway, if we want to start replanting we need to find economically viable models  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:13):**  to encourage people to do so.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:15):**  Particularly in poor countries you can't just tell people to put a fence around the forest  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:19):**  and don't touch it.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:20):**  People need to make money, they need to live, they need to eat.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:23):**  And they've always done so in the forest but obviously with the change of lifestyle and  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:30):**  explosion of populations the pressure became or becomes too much.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah, there's always a long history of cultivating food in the Amazon and there's a lot of interesting  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:44):**  archaeological work that's kind of working at the overlap between archaeology and botany  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:50):**  and anthropology to try and figure out what these Amazonian societies looked like.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:18:56):**  But it seems quite clear that there were what we would now consider as orchards or plantations  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:02):**  in the middle of the forest that people identified particular species that were useful to them  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:07):**  and rather than having to go out and forage for them, well why not plant these species  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:14):**  close to where you live.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:15):**  So the native rainforest for at least 10,000 years in the case of the Amazon has had some  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:25):**  human influence.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:29):**  And people are mapping where archaeological sites are and then overlaying that with botanical  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:34):**  surveys and saying look every time there's a human settlement there's certain species  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:40):**  that occur in much higher concentrations than they would do naturally.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:45):**  So it seems fairly clear that there was some kind of commercial fruit plantation and medicine  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:51):**  or timber that the people in the Amazon have been cultivating certain plants for a long  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:57):**  time.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:19:58):**  What's changed now is that there's huge chunks of the forest that are being cut down and  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:03):**  that's primarily for soy or cattle, a bit of mining as well but it's mainly soy and  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:09):**  cattle that are driving that.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:12):**  And soy in itself is used as feed for livestock.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:16):**  So yeah, meat production is probably the biggest thing that's driving deforestation.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:25):**  And is that something that you're, I mean there's a lot of talk about meat replacements,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:29):**  plant-based food, etc.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:31):**  Is it something you are looking at as well?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:34):**  Yes, but with the, I would put a caveat on that.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:43):**  There's certain vegetables and certain fruits that have a very high protein content.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:51):**  So I'm extremely interested in identifying what those are and trying to create new markets  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:57):**  for these.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:20:58):**  You know there's 4,000 fruits in the Amazon and we don't know what half of them do.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:03):**  We haven't really carried out the analysis on it.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:06):**  But you know, acai, which is one of the fruits that we'll be planting in Amata, which has  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:12):**  become a kind of trendy fruit in the US and increasingly in Europe.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:17):**  Superfood.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:18):**  Superfood, yeah.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:19):**  And it is, it's got a ton of vitamins.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:22):**  It's also got protein in there.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:24):**  So there are lots of naturally occurring plants that can be used as sources of vegetable protein.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:32):**  Where I'm a little bit cautious is when you get into the more sort of high-tech approaches.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:39):**  And what makes me uneasy there is if you get to a point where certain very wealthy people  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:46):**  essentially own the IP on food, I'm not convinced that the social consequences of that, which  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:21:54):**  will be negative social consequences, would be enough to justify the positive environmental  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:00):**  ones.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:01):**  So I'm a little bit uneasy about some of these meat replacements.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:06):**  In theory, it's good and we do need to significantly reduce the amounts of livestock that are being  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:15):**  produced and consumed.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:18):**  But if we end up replacing an environmental problem with a social problem, i.e. a handful  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:25):**  of billionaires own the IP on food, I'm not sure that that's a good thing.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:29):**  In fact, I'm sure it's a bad thing.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:35):**  We would just replace one problem with the other and probably it becomes an issue.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:42):**  I think it is an issue.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:43):**  You know, there's obviously a difference of opinion on this.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:48):**  That's as much to do with corporate governance and with the way these investments are structured  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:56):**  as it is to do with the underlying technology itself.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:22:59):**  You know, soy, tofu, seitan, there are processed vegetable proteins that have existed for a  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:09):**  long time.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:10):**  So the fact that somebody is making a meat replacement doesn't bother me at all.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:17):**  What bothers me is who ends up owning that technology.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:23):**  And if there's a serious problem to do with wealth concentration in the world at the moment  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:28):**  and in places like the US, it's getting worse rather than getting better.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:35):**  And if we don't address that problem, there's no hope of addressing climate change either  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:43):**  because the people who are causing the most damage are the wealthy people.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:50):**  They have very consumer driven lifestyles, but also the very poor people because if you're  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:23:57):**  sort of desperately poor, you're going to try and make your living any way you can.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:01):**  If there's a tree, you'll cut it down, you know, burn it for firewood, whatever.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:04):**  So if we exacerbate these problems of income inequality, there is no hope of addressing  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:13):**  climate change.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:14):**  And even in and of itself, we shouldn't be driving income inequality.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:19):**  So that's where my slight concern is around some of these processed food technologies.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:27):**  It's who owns the IP.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:28):**  It's not the technology in itself that bothers me.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:32):**  And what will you be working on?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:35):**  Let's say we talk again in a year from now.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:39):**  What will you be looking back at?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:41):**  And 2018 was the year of X, Y and Z.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:45):**  What would you be happy to look back at?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:49):**  I'd be happy if more people take the plunge and start actually allocating capital.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:24:59):**  And that seems to be happening already.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:03):**  From my own personal project, an area that interests me, you know, when you harvest fruit  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:13):**  or crops, what do you do with the residues?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:17):**  Some of those residues, you can recycle them back into the land.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:20):**  It's not the same with timber harvesting.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:23):**  Some of that will go back into the land.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:27):**  Not all of agricultural residues will decompose rapidly enough to be of use in a commercial  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:36):**  farming venture.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:37):**  You want stuff to decompose within a year so that you can use it next year.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:42):**  So what do you do with that excess of residue?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:45):**  Or what do you do with the stuff that by its sort of structure doesn't decompose very quickly?  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:52):**  How do you put those residues to use?  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:55):**  And again, it could be industrial or it could be cosmetic.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:25:59):**  But non-food uses for agricultural residues and getting that balance right so that you're  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:05):**  not taking away productive land that can be used for food production.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:11):**  But you are valorizing as much of what you produce as possible.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:15):**  So I think that's hopefully where I will be next year.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:21):**  And who knows, maybe one day my own personal circle will join up and I'll start getting  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:28):**  closer to what it is that my grandfather did, which was high-tech component parts.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:33):**  And there's interesting stuff going on there, you know, with natural fibers, including for  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:38):**  the car industry.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:42):**  Cars are being built using agricultural residues, which is a pretty interesting circle for  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:47):**  you.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:48):**  For me personally, it would be interesting to go full circle and to end up getting a  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:54):**  little bit closer to what it was that my grandfather did.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:56):**  I never thought that's where I would end up, but who knows?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:26:59):**  Life can take you in funny directions.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:02):**  And looking at the people that didn't take the plunge yet but are interested, what do  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:07):**  you see as the two most important barriers of making regenerative agriculture and agroforestry  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:14):**  on a broader scale economically viable but also accepted and fit into portfolios basically?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:22):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:27):**  I think historically it's been an asset class for wealthy investors, both because of the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:35):**  amount of money that you need to get active in this space and also because of the amount  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:43):**  of time you need to tie it up for.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:46):**  That most people don't have large amounts of money that they can tie up for a long period  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:50):**  of time.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:51):**  So I think that's been off-putting to individual investors.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:27:57):**  To institutional investors, I think what's off-putting-  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:00):**  It's probably also the time.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:02):**  It's partly the time.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:04):**  Some people who say they're long-term investors wouldn't be prepared.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:08):**  Most of them aren't going to lock up their money for 20 years and very few will lock  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:11):**  it up for 10 years.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:13):**  Also because I heard yesterday a lot of the bonus structures and compensation structures  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:19):**  are still on a very short-term basis.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:22):**  So if you pay somebody to deliver short-term results, although you have in your company  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:28):**  headlines etc.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:29):**  We are a long-term investor.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:30):**  So if you pay your people to have short-term results, they probably will get up with short-term  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:35):**  results.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:36):**  So if the underlying structure, investment structure, but also compensation, basically  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:41):**  the whole internal structure doesn't line up with long-term, it's very difficult to  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:47):**  get those long-term results we want.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:49):**  Yeah, I think that's certainly true.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:52):**  And there's maybe more flexibility from corporate investors.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:28:58):**  If there's somebody who has an obvious strategic interest in securing their supply chain and  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:04):**  making it sustainable for the long term, I think you might see corporates move quicker  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:09):**  than pure financial investors.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:13):**  Have you seen it already in this space?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:15):**  On a small scale, yes, some corporates are doing it.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:19):**  Sometimes it's coming more from a quasi-philanthropic angle.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:23):**  So it's a sort of odd mix of R&D meets philanthropy.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:29):**  There are some corporates who are looking more seriously at their whole supply chain.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:38):**  I was chatting just last night with someone from Caring, which is a big French luxury  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:48):**  conglomerate.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:50):**  They do seem to be looking quite seriously at their entire supply chain.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:54):**  Where is our wool coming from?  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:56):**  Where is our cotton coming from?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:57):**  Where is our leather coming from?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:29:58):**  They did a true price analysis, right?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:02):**  For Puma and then for their whole company.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:04):**  I remember that.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:06):**  Which was interesting because leather was their main...  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:10):**  If the true price of their whole supply chain was in their profit statement, they would  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:16):**  be running at a loss mainly because of their suppliers, mainly because of where they get  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:21):**  their raw materials from.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:22):**  Right, right.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:23):**  So I think there are some companies who are looking at this in quite a serious way and  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:28):**  realizing that it's important to them if they want to secure those supply chains in the  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:36):**  future.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:38):**  Sustainability isn't just a buzzword.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:41):**  It's vital.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:42):**  So I think there are some corporates who are beginning to do this.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:45):**  And obviously the closer your business is to the raw materials, the more of an issue  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:50):**  it is for you.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:53):**  Because we live in quite a dematerialized world.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:30:59):**  This maybe is a barrier as well to people investing into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:05):**  So much of what we do seems kind of invisible.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:08):**  Electricity or the Skype connection that we're using to talk to each other, that we can end  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:14):**  up being quite disconnected from the actual raw materials that are necessary to enable  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:20):**  our lives.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:23):**  So the closer one can get to those raw materials, whether it's because you're a corporate that  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:30):**  uses them or whether it's just some kind of life experience.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:35):**  You go on a trip to the forest or you grew up on a farm.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:39):**  I think the closer one can get back to those raw materials, the more likely one is to make  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:44):**  the plunge.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:45):**  So the sort of dematerialized lives that most of us in the developed world live, I think  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:53):**  is potentially an impediment to more people putting money into regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:31:59):**  as well.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:00):**  And would that be, and that would be my final question, also your advice to smart impact  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:05):**  investors who are hopefully all listening to this podcast and that are ready or they  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:12):**  are interested in regenerative agriculture, they have educated themselves.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:16):**  Would it be your advice to go out and also get closer to potential investments?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:22):**  And what would other advice be for people that want to take the plunge like you?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:28):**  I think it's a hugely important area to be investing into because no matter how dematerialized  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:35):**  our lives feel, we are totally dependent on these raw materials for our food, for our  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:40):**  clothing and even for this Skype call.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:42):**  The computer, the servers that we're using, they're all built out of something.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:47):**  They don't care.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:48):**  We breathe.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:50):**  So it's a hugely important area to be investing into.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:32:55):**  I guess my advice to people who are interested in this, spend a bit of time figuring out  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:04):**  what seems the right way for you to do it.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:06):**  How much money do you have to invest?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:09):**  How long can you afford?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:10):**  How much can you afford to lose?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:12):**  How long can you afford to lock it up for?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:17):**  Think a bit about where in the value chain you want to invest.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:22):**  Do you want to be investing directly into the land itself?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:24):**  Do you want to be investing into processing or distribution?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:32):**  Think about geography.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:34):**  Do you want to invest in your own country or your own neighborhood or your own region?  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:39):**  Do you want to go into a foreign geography?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:43):**  Think about water.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:44):**  Unfortunately, some parts of the world, it sounds mean to say this, but they won't have  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:51):**  enough water.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:52):**  So it's probably not a good place to be investing, even if those places desperately need investment,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:33:58):**  unless you can think of a way to manage those issues of inadequate water supply, that's  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:07):**  a risk to take into account.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:12):**  And then I would say just do it.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:14):**  Put a small amount to work.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:16):**  And there are ways now that exist with crowdfunding or in the US you have...  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:22):**  Yeah, I was going to ask that.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:24):**  Actually, I always ask the last question and then I ask another last question.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:28):**  But do you see now that there are ways to overcome these two barriers you mentioned,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:32):**  both the time that money has to be locked in, but also that the starter amount, you  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:38):**  need quite a bit of money to be in to the place.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:40):**  But actually, we're answering that question right away.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:43):**  So please go ahead.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:44):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, I mean, I think crowdfunding is a positive development or peer to peer lending.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:34:53):**  In the US, you now have these REITs, real estate investment trusts, which allow people  
**[0:35:00-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:00):**  to put smaller amounts into farmland because some of them are farmland investing vehicles.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:10):**  So hopefully, we'll see more developments like that.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:16):**  Cryptocurrency is a big buzzword at the moment.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:20):**  I'm not 100% sure that the infrastructure exists yet for allocating money via cryptocurrency,  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:31):**  but I'm slightly out of my depth here.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:34):**  So maybe that's something else that might develop in 2018 or 2020, that there will be  
**[0:35:42-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:42):**  new ways for people to put smaller amounts, to pool smaller amounts and put their money  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:50):**  to work collectively into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:55):**  I mean, if we can use Skype and etc. to make these calls, also, that should be possible,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:35:59):**  right?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:00):**  It ought to be possible.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:02):**  It ought to be possible.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:03):**  I'm a little bit wary just because I see a lot of froth and fraud going on with cowboys.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:09):**  Yeah, no, definitely.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:11):**  I mean, get rich quick with cryptocurrencies.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:14):**  As soon as they start saying get rich quick with farmland, you should be very, very careful.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:20):**  Yeah, you should be very careful.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:24):**  You can get rich slowly.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:28):**  Or lose it very fast.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:29):**  We have this idea of losing it fast.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:32):**  There are these cultural memes and messages that we hear.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:37):**  So, you know, move fast and break things.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:40):**  This is what the kind of Silicon Valley venture capitalists are saying.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:45):**  And I would almost say what we need is the exact opposite.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:48):**  Move slowly and build things.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:50):**  It doesn't mean you can't make money, but it won't be at the same rate.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:54):**  It will be more sort of slow and steady.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:36:59):**  That's extremely interesting.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:00):**  In agriculture, forestry is even more long term.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:04):**  And I mean, time means a very different thing compared if you're building an app, obviously.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:11):**  And I see also these discussions with investors and with fund managers and a lot of people  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:16):**  that they have to get used again to not a different way of investing, but a different  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:22):**  pace and a different expectations.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:26):**  And things don't move that fast because you have the seasons and nature is inner and slow,  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:32):**  but will continue to move for a long time.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:34):**  So there's this very and people got a bit disconnected from that in general, probably  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:38):**  in life, but also in their investment practices that they expect something in quarter two  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:43):**  instead of year five.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:45):**  And that's quite a long we have to get slowly used to a slower pace there.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:51):**  Yeah, I mean, I would this is, you know, I would sort of throw this out.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:37:55):**  I don't know if this is my last comment or my penultimate comment.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:00):**  If if we're sort of serious about sustainability, to me, there's an elephant in the room, which  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:05):**  is the way stock markets perform at the moment or the way GDP growth has been performing  
**[0:38:12-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:12):**  over the last 100 or even 200, 200 years is totally dependent on burning fossil fuels.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:20):**  So it's not just, you know, ExxonMobil or Total or Shell or BP that are going to see  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:30):**  a destruction of value.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:32):**  If we move to a sustainable economy all across the stock market, you're going to see you're  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:37):**  going to see a significant correction.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:39):**  I'm not saying we'll go back to sort of pre-industrial levels of growth because our technology is  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:45):**  far better than it was then.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:47):**  But somewhere between the levels of growth we've got used to and those pre-industrial  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:53):**  levels of growth, there is going to be some point there will be a correction.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:38:59):**  And if we as impact investors or environmental investors or whatever you want to say, if  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:05):**  we're serious about about about sustainability, how do we anticipate that correction?  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:12):**  I don't know when it will come, but how do we anticipate that overall market movement?  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:18):**  How do we prepare for it?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:20):**  And again, I would say part of the reason, one of the reasons I've ended up investing  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:25):**  in the two geographies I have in New Zealand, now in Brazil, is that not all countries are  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:32):**  created equal.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:33):**  So if we do start reverting to natural levels of growth, i.e. how much can the planet produce  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:39):**  in one year and we consume less than the planet produces in one year, you want to you as an  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:45):**  investor probably want to be in those parts of the planet that have high levels of natural  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:49):**  growth.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:50):**  New Zealand has pretty good growth levels.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:53):**  Brazil has excellent growth levels.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:39:55):**  And there's a sort of a strip of land around the equator worldwide where things just grow  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:03):**  quicker.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:04):**  Those aren't necessarily the easiest countries to be investing into, they tend to be, you  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:09):**  know, and poorly governed.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:12):**  Which is very weird if you think about it.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:14):**  It's strange, isn't it?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:15):**  The places where it grows the best end up being in many cases the poorest.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:23):**  It's a paradox, isn't it?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:24):**  But you know, maybe this is not for 2018, but maybe in 100 years time, try and imagine  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:30):**  a world without fossil fuels where we're only living on what the planet can produce in one  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:34):**  year rather than, you know, fossil fuels that took 300 million years to form.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:40):**  Then maybe these countries that historically have been poor and have had a bad deal from  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:44):**  globalization, they'll find themselves in a dominant position.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:48):**  You know, that would be a pretty radical shift.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:52):**  Because they can produce the food, the fibers and the oils we need.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:40:56):**  It would seem the obvious place to source all of those products from, the places where  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:00):**  they grow quickest.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:01):**  I mean, I feel like we can talk another hour on that, but I want to be conscious of your  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:05):**  time as well.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:07):**  And we'll just check in again.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:08):**  I mean, there's no reason not to do it because probably in 2018 Skype will still be there.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:14):**  And otherwise we find another technology to get this recording.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:20):**  We'll check in in 100 years time and see if my prediction was right.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:23):**  I'm imagining it will go a bit faster, but yeah, we'll see.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:27):**  Thank you so much for your time and we'll definitely check in before 100 years.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:34):**  It's a pleasure.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:35):**  It was a pleasure talking.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:36):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:38):**  You just listened to an interview with Rufo.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:40):**  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did and all of the tips he shared on how to start  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:44):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and take the plunge.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:47):**  Thank you for making the time to listen to this podcast and making it all the way till  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:51):**  the end.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:41:52):**  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:44:34):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:45:05):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:45:07):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:45:10):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/#t=0:45:13):**  It's also not investment advice.

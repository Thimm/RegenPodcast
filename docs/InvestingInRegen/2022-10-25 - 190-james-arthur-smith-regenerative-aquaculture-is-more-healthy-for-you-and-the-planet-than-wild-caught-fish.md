## 190 James Arthur Smith - Regenerative aquaculture is more healthy for you and the planet than wild caught fish  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:14):**  Regenerative aquaculture, how do we farm the oceans regeneratively?  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:18):**  We all heard of the massive issues of fishing and especially the industrial scale extractive  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:23):**  way we are basically emptying the oceans.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:26):**  So the solution is very simple, simply farm the fish, also known as aquaculture.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:30):**  But also there are enormous challenges with unsustainable feed, concentrated pollution  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:35):**  and commodified markets, just to name a few.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:38):**  It very much sounds like the rest of the agriculture and food industry.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:42):**  So what can be done?  
**[0:00:43-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:00:43):**  Join us today in a deep dive, pun intended, into the world of regenerative aquaculture.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:11):**  Try my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:16):**  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:21):**  and consume.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:22):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:26):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode today, a very special one where we go deep into the blue side of  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:03):**  the planet.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:04):**  Today, we're welcome.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:05):**  I'm welcoming James to the show, the founder of Sea Topia, a pioneering regenerative aquaculture  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:09):**  business for the direct to consumer markets.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome James.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:13):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:14):**  It's such a pleasure to be here and be part of this conversation.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:18):**  And to start with the question I always start with a very subtle but still fundamental difference.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:23):**  So not why soil, but why the oceans?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:26):**  Why farming in the oceans?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:28):**  How do you end up there?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:30):**  As many people in the farming industry can say, I grew up on a farm, then I went away  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:33):**  and I came back, etc.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:34):**  But the chances you grew up on an ocean farm are very small.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:39):**  So I'm going to guess here that wasn't the reason you ended up here.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:42):**  Like, how did you ended up caring so much about the oceans and working in with them  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:47):**  so much?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:50):**  That's funny that you position the question that way, because while I didn't grow up on  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:55):**  an ocean farm, I did grow up practically in the ocean.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:02:58):**  And I guess that has shaped a lot of my direction in life.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:04):**  My father was a lifeguard, so I grew up just at the beach every single day.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:10):**  My mother worked at SeaWorld at the time.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:12):**  So I was fascinated by the aquariums and I really wanted to be involved in oceanography,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:21):**  marine biology, and particularly the big mammals.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:25):**  Cetaceans were so interesting to me.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:27):**  So I started volunteering at an aquarium as an adolescent where they had, this was a really  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:33):**  unique aquarium, on a estuary on a wetland that used to have a healthy population of  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:41):**  steelhead.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:42):**  And so in this aquarium, they had a demonstration rehabilitation project where they're actually  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:48):**  breeding steelhead and showing how the steelhead would go from freshwater to saltwater and  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:56):**  back and forth.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:03:58):**  The principles of breeding fish for rehabilitation first introduced me to the principles of aquaculture.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:06):**  And I guess fast forward many years later, I was able to get more directly involved with  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:12):**  aquaculture.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:15):**  So yeah, I got involved with it, I guess, because of a bit of nurture and my fortunate  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:26):**  being born in a family that was connected to the ocean.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:33):**  But I think we're all born kind of in that space, even if we're, as long as we're on  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:38):**  the blue planet, we should be thinking about how can we efficiently work with the blue  
**[0:04:43-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:43):**  planet because whether it's farming the ocean or in freshwater, there's a lot more water  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:53):**  on this planet than there is land.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:56):**  So how do we work with that efficiently?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:04:59):**  So you basically were born in the ocean, but then still the step from going there, I mean,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:05):**  there were many different routes you could take, you could become a professional server  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:09):**  or an activist really caring about the oceans, you could really focus on plant based fish  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:16):**  food, you could focus fish food, not meal, you could focus on many things on the pollution  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:22):**  side of things, but you decided to focus on the food side and take quite a, I would really  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:27):**  say neglected route.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:29):**  Like how do we get regenerative aquaculture, those two words together, we don't hear very  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:33):**  often for sure I'm getting emails now, but we don't hear it very often, well, we should.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:37):**  Like what was that trigger to regenerative aquaculture?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:41):**  What triggered you into the food side of things and starting to answer or at least ask many,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:46):**  many very complicated questions in the aquaculture sector?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:50):**  There's, I'm in a contrarian space I would say, because most people believe hook, line  
**[0:05:58-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:05:58):**  and sinker, this romanticized story of commercial fishing, of going to the ocean and being able  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:09):**  to extract seafood and wild caught seafood is this beautiful thing and there is, if done  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:15):**  sustainably is the most romantic and beautiful way to do it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:22):**  But when I was studying ecology and marine biology, textbooks are talking early about  
**[0:06:33-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:33):**  the potential of aquaculture done right to create healthy seafood in a controlled environment  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:43):**  where you control the feed and you control the exposure to toxins.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:48):**  You can in the same way that we can raise tomatoes or chicken or cattle done right,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:06:56):**  you can produce an absolutely beautiful product that's clean, that's nutrient dense, that's  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:04):**  free of exposure to toxins.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:07):**  And the principles of aquaculture have been there from the beginning, but I guess I'm  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:15):**  just kind of an optimist and reading about the principles of aquaculture very early on  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:21):**  didn't end up aligning with the reality.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:27):**  So if you as a consumer are looking for sustainable farm raised seafood, it's kind of a murky  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:37):**  confusion place.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:38):**  So I remember at one point feeling that I didn't want to go to a sushi bar because I  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:47):**  didn't want to condone industrial scale commercial fishing, knowing the challenges that are being  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:07:54):**  placed on our oceans from industrial scale extraction of wild caught fisheries.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:02):**  I didn't want to condone that.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:04):**  So what was the alternative having a foundation on the principles of ecology and aquaculture  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:14):**  being a methodology for raising fish?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:20):**  Where were those good fish farms?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:22):**  And there just wasn't enough information about that.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:25):**  There wasn't enough detailed certification processes, transparency.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:34):**  And so I actually went and started visiting farms and wanted to find out which farms were  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:40):**  actually producing high quality seafood and doing it in a manner that was in line with  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:48):**  my values.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:50):**  And so I actually went to Mexico.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:54):**  So I grew up mostly in Southern California, lived in Hawaii for a while.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:08:59):**  And funny enough, you mentioned the professional surfing and actually thought surfing was the  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:02):**  most important thing in the world for a number of years.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:05):**  I lived on the North Shore of Oahu and pursued that for a bit.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:11):**  That's part of the reason that I learned as much as I did about commercial fishing from  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:17):**  a number of relationships that I built out there.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:21):**  And wanting to do something that was directly related to the oceans after having sold another  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:35):**  consumer product good business that I had at an energy bar company that was a quinoa  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:42):**  based energy bar that we were sourcing from these fair trade farms in Peru and Bolivia.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:50):**  And we had all of the certifications for USD Organic and we were selling it in Whole Foods  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:56):**  nationwide.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:57):**  That was interesting.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:09:58):**  And it was on some levels, it was of value to me.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:07):**  But I really wanted to be involved with the oceans.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:09):**  And I wanted to be involved in food systems because food has always been really important  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:14):**  to me and my wife, it's been very important to her.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:18):**  It's been just one of these things that I've cared a lot about, I guess, probably stemming  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:25):**  from health.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:26):**  And I think the fish part is fascinating, especially the farming part, because that  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:33):**  contrarian piece you mentioned at the beginning, I think many people sort of easily click into  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:41):**  that thought of fish farming is bad, like you said.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:44):**  And if we just all buy sustainably fished wild card, we will be fine.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:51):**  And that's probably a bit of a naive or very naive view.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:55):**  So the question is, and at the same time, it's not naive, I think, to think at all that  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:10:59):**  most of or a big chunk of the fish farming space is definitely not run with regenerative  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:05):**  principles.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:06):**  Let's say like that, like there's a lot of non transparency and a lot of chemicals and  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:11):**  a lot of input and a lot of just like farming is many cases not done regeneratively.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:17):**  But you're saying, I found I went out to look for and where did you start?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:22):**  Like I went out to look for the regenerative fish farms, where are the ones that are taking  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:26):**  input seriously, taking feed seriously, taking high quality sushi grades, work seriously?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:34):**  Where do you even start when you get when you said I went to Mexico, but where do you  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:38):**  even I mean, it's not that you Google this stuff, like how do you find the first one,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:41):**  maybe the first one leads to others, but that first one, do you remember how you found it  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:44):**  and how it was going there?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:48-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:11:48):**  Southern California is a is a nice place for being involved in the food scene.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:01):**  There's a farm to table movement of restaurants that has is really connected to farms.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:09):**  And on most menus, you know, at farm table restaurants, they'll reference where their  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:14):**  tomatoes and their chickens come from.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:16):**  But seafood is kind of a missing piece.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:20):**  They'll kind of reference, sometimes they'll reference that it's wild caught, or sometimes  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:27):**  they'll reference the name of the fishermen, but they're not going into more detail on  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:31):**  that.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:32):**  So I went to Mexico to visit some farms that were raising fish because there are no fish  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:41):**  farms in the ocean in California.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:44):**  It's not currently legal.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:46):**  There's no legal fish farming in in the oceans in this region.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:51):**  You can do it on land.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:12:54):**  But just south of the border, there's a tuna ranch that I had become familiar with because  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:01):**  it's next to a a renowned surf spot, a spot called Salsepue, this and they have these  
**[0:13:06-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:06):**  huge open ocean floating PVC circular pens that that hold these giant nets and they put  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:18):**  tuna in there.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:19):**  That is not actually a sustainable model.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:22):**  They're essentially ranching a wild species and then feeding it wild caught sardines.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:28):**  But I kept going further because I was familiar with that.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:32):**  People mentioning tuna farming as sort of trying to farm a tiger.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:36):**  And that's probably not like, first of all, it's not easy.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:39):**  And second, the feed in, the feed to food ratio is feed conversion ratio or FCR is very,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:47):**  very, very high.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:48):**  But we want to eat tuna.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:49):**  So that's what the market creates.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:51):**  But that was your first exposure.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:53):**  And you're like, OK, let's go further south and and see if there are other models.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:13:58):**  Yeah, I was I was aware of that, but I wanted to see it and just to be among to be in that  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:03):**  place to swim in pens like that and to have.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:06):**  How is that?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:07):**  Like what's this to just to to to give people I mean, we're on Audi, obviously, but a visual  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:14):**  clue or a journey like you go into a pen like that.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:17):**  First of all, how big are the pens and then how how many fishes more or less?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:22):**  I don't think there are exact numbers, but how many are there in it?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:25):**  Like what is the size we need to to to keep having our mind as we're listening to this?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:31):**  40 meters across would be could be the and similar depth.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:39):**  So I mean, one of the most beautiful things about farming the ocean is the potential for  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:43):**  three dimensional space.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:45):**  You know, in terrestrial farming, you're farming on land and you have limited resources.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:51):**  But when you're farming the ocean, you have depth, right?  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:14:54):**  So the the volume inside of that pen is actually quite significant.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:01):**  You can have a lot of creatures in there.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:05):**  The biomass is massive.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:08):**  And the the experience of swimming in that I mean, is is literally like swimming in the  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:16):**  most incredible aquarium that you've ever that you've ever seen.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:19):**  I mean, you could literally be swimming in a circle of 150 to 200 pound torpedoes.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:29):**  You know, nature has evolved these tuna that are warm blooded creatures that that have  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:35):**  the ability to swim, you know, 30, 40 miles per hour.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:39):**  And you're and they, you know, if they wanted to, they could they could easily kill you.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:45):**  They could drive them, you know, full speed right into you.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:48):**  But they just stay right at the perimeter of the of of, you know, where they feel safe.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:55):**  And they just kind of circling around.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:56):**  They look at you and they're intelligent creatures.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:57):**  They're looking at you.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:15:58):**  They're thinking about you.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:01):**  I had a lot of mixed emotions being there.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:03):**  It was a very sad and awesome place to be to see that in a ranch and to see how it's  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:10):**  working.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:12):**  And it's not to say that there is no buddy farming tuna.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:16):**  There are people that are farming tuna from eggs.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:18):**  This is a tuna ranch.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:20):**  But still, the problem, as you mentioned, is the FCR, the feed conversion ratio of these  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:25):**  high energy, warm blooded creatures.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:27):**  They spend so much energy that to feed them.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:32):**  It's just it's not an efficient conversion ratio of energy inputs.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:37):**  It's something like 20 to 120 pounds of feed in to grow one pound of biomass.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:43):**  And they're very finicky about what they eat.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:46):**  Because most tuna farms or ranches in the world are still feeding them whole sardines  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:53):**  from the ocean.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:16:54):**  There are some people that have developed a pelletized feed, but it's very difficult  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:00):**  to get them to eat it.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:01):**  In some cases, they're actually painting what looks like an eyeball on these little sausages  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:05):**  in order to get them to eat it.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:08):**  So it's not ideal.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:09):**  If you're looking for a model of what's an efficient fish to raise, it's not tuna.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:22):**  But there are other creatures.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:23):**  If you look at, for example, the feed conversion ratio portion of it, what inputs are the lowest  
**[0:17:31-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:31):**  are going to be things like filter feeders or plants that don't require any inputs from  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:42):**  humans.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:43):**  We don't have to go out there and feed them.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:44):**  They're just filtering from the ocean or converting.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:46):**  Plus they don't move so much.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:48):**  So they don't burn so much energy.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:52):**  You don't have to keep them in nets.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:53):**  Filter feeders are the bivalves, the muscles, etc.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:17:58):**  The oysters as well.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:01):**  And they clean.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:03):**  So from an energy perspective, that's like it doesn't get better than that.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:06):**  And kelp obviously on the plant side.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:08):**  The whole plant family in the ocean is fascinating, not only because of speed, but also because  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:14):**  of health and because it looks spectacular.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:17):**  And then there's some unappreciated ones like sea cucumbers that are going to be on the  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:22):**  bottom that are going to be cleaning the sand.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:24):**  So you have an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system or INTA, which is essentially a permaculture  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:33):**  model in the ocean.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:35):**  You have a symbiotic relationship between your filter feeders, your crustaceans, your  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:44):**  kelps, your sea vegetables and your fish.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:47):**  So what are the members of that ecosystem that you want to cohabitat your concession  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:56):**  or your farm?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:18:57):**  So as I kept going further south, I was able to find a handful of other farms in Mexico.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:03):**  There's actually quite a bit of aquaculture.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:05):**  Mexico's in some ways, I would say more advanced in aquaculture than the United States, primarily  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:10):**  because Mexico already sold a lot of its fishing rights to the Chinese and kind of is on the  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:16):**  pendulum swing of trying to figure out how to create a sustainable financial model for  
**[0:19:24-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:24):**  fisheries in Mexico because they went from having beautiful, healthy fishing culture  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:34):**  and economies to selling off a lot of their resources, having it being overfished and  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:38):**  then having local communities now dependent on subsidies.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:42):**  So they're now investing quite a bit in aquaculture.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:45):**  Some good, some not so good, but they're definitely evolving, I would say more rapidly even than  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:50):**  parts of the United States.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:52):**  And did you find one of those, it sounds perfect on paper, obviously you have the 3D space,  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:19:58):**  you have the plants, you have the bivalves, the crustaceans that clean, you have the sea  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:02):**  cucumber and you have the fish.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:05):**  But is that being done, I wouldn't say at scale, but is it being done in practice at  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:11):**  a certain commercial scale yet, because I think for many people, even this word of the multi-species  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:18):**  and the integration of multi-species is new.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:20):**  Like is that, did you find things there that were like, wow, okay, I didn't know this existed  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:24):**  as sort of the complete opposite to the wrenching wild tigers in the tuna farm.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:32):**  So at commercial scale, there's not anyone doing it with an integrated multicultural,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:38):**  polytrophic site in Mexico, but there's a lot, all the components are there.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:44):**  So there's people doing kelp, there's algaes, there's mussels, there's scallops, there's  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:20:54):**  oysters, there's striped bass, there's kompachi.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:00):**  So different species of finfish are going to have a very different feed conversion ratio.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:06):**  So for example, kompachi or Cereolo rebeliana, which is a type of yellowtail has a feed conversion  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:12):**  ratio closer to one to one or even lower depending on the feed components.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:17):**  So I ended up spending a number of years working with this kompachi farm in the Sea of Cortez,  
**[0:21:24-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:24):**  which is the Southern tip of the Baja Peninsula on the Eastern side there, where they're raising  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:33):**  this kompachi, which is essentially an almakojack or Cereolo rebeliana that grows at a very  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:40):**  efficient rate and can be adapted to eating a feed that is a much more sustainable.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:48):**  So an algae-based feed that can be grown regeneratively can be a high feed component for the omega  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:21:57):**  threes, the oils and the proteins that it needs, combining that with either land-based  
**[0:22:05-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:05):**  proteins, it could be a variety of different sources, it really has the ability to create  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:16):**  a sustainable feed for a fish that grows very efficiently.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:21):**  And then as long as that, even if it isn't monoculture in this case, done at low density  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:27):**  in a well-sited location, I think is a very important part of creating a healthy food  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:35):**  system.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:36):**  So this farm, for example, does low density farming, is sited in an area that is far from  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:46):**  industrial pollutants, deep water, tons of current, in fact, twice a day of the amount  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:54):**  of tide that flushes through this.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:22:56):**  You have sometimes two to three knots of current flowing through this.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:00):**  Which is important to keep things flowing, like the manure basically of the fish to keep  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:07):**  it flowing out, making sure disease and pathogens don't get a chance.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:12):**  It's better to be diluting it with a lot of sea water twice a day than being in a closed  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:18):**  environment unless you need to start farming.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:22):**  But then do you get to that health piece you mentioned?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:27):**  Because that's what everybody says, yeah, of course you can feed it with a lot of different  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:30):**  things.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:31):**  You can feed it with plants.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:32):**  There are fish that eat everything.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:34):**  But then it doesn't get to that healthy omega-6, omega-3 ratio fish that we're looking for,  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:38):**  because we're looking for omega-3s.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:41):**  And then everybody says, yeah, but then it's better to go to wild.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:44):**  What do you say to people?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:45):**  You get this question for sure all the time.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:48):**  How do you answer the health question of farmed very, very well versus wild that we have no  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:54):**  clue where it comes from?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:57):**  It just depends on the feed, right?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:23:58):**  So the evolution of feed in aquaculture kind of followed the trajectory of first, let's  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:06):**  feed them exactly what they eat in the wild, which is sardines, anchovies, anchovetas,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:11):**  mackerel.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:12):**  But there's a finite resource in the ocean.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:16):**  The underlying issue is there's a finite resource and the gross production of wild-caught seafood  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:23):**  has plateaued.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:26):**  We're not going to find a new well of fish in the ocean.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:31):**  We've plateaued already, so we can't keep extracting.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:34):**  And it probably is going down, because in many places it's collapsing.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:39):**  We can't wait for the moment we cannot keep throwing sardines into a tuna pan.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:45):**  No, no.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:46):**  And we should probably eat the sardines directly if we end up doing that anyway.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:50):**  There's that really weird eat lower on the food chain thing.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:54):**  So that's the first phase.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:55):**  And then the second phase is, okay, we replace it with something else.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:24:57):**  Let's replace it with soy, et cetera, to fatten the fish.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:02):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:03):**  So it evolved from, okay, let's mitigate the pressure on the bait fish and give them land-based  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:10):**  proteins like the soys and the corns.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:14):**  And then that had a direct effect on the omega-3, omega-6 levels, because again, fish don't  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:22):**  produce omega-3s, with the rare exception.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:25):**  There is only a handful of fish in the entire world that produce their omega-3s.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:29):**  It comes from the feed.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:31):**  So if you're feeding them whole fish, they're getting their omega-3s.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:35):**  In fact, in the early days of farming, there was a lot of studies done that quantified  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:42):**  even higher levels of omega-3s in farmed fish than you saw in wild caught fish, because  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:47):**  they were just getting such a healthy diet.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:52):**  But you were extracting a lot of these resources in order to feed them.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:25:55):**  Not that wild fish don't also eat the same amount, if not more, because they're expending  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:01):**  more energy.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:02):**  But regardless, if you're going to scale aquaculture to feed the world, how do we do it efficiently?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:07):**  So transitioning from anchovetas or bait fish to land-based resources, like soy and corn,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:16):**  but then how do you evolve the omega-3, omega-6 and protein resources?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:23):**  The original source of omega-3s comes from algae.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:29):**  So an algae-based feed is going to provide the actual omega-3 content that the fish needs.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:38):**  So growing different types of microalgae to be used in feed is something that is currently  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:47):**  evolving.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:48):**  There's a lot of investment actually happening in the commercial and industrial scale production  
**[0:26:52-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:26:52):**  of different types of microalgae for aquaculture and other industries, because you can now,  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:02):**  feeding a compote, for example, an algae-based diet, get even more omega-3s than a wild caught  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:08):**  fish.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:09):**  So it really just depends on the actual components that are going to feed.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:13):**  The challenge is the cost, because still, there's a lot of subsidies in wild caught  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:20):**  fisheries.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:21):**  For anyone who doesn't know, there are massive studies.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:24):**  I think Planet Tracker has a great one.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:26):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:27):**  The amount of money we throw at, we burn in industrial scale extractive fishing is just  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:34):**  mind boggling.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:35):**  It would never be able to pay for itself if we all, I mean, collective society, including  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:41):**  the Chinese government and others, wouldn't be heavily subsidizing their fuel, their boats  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:46):**  and everything else.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:47):**  It's really, really crazy.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:50):**  It's a completely bankrupt industry, unless it would be subsidized by all of us.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:53):**  European Union, US, the whole thing has been.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:56):**  And it's, yeah, not many people know that.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:27:59):**  That's been subsidized.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:00):**  And of course, you're competing because you have to grow the feed as well.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:02):**  But the wild one just goes out and get the mackerel that has been eating other fishes  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:07):**  that have been eating algae.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:08):**  So that's a challenge.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:10):**  Yeah, yeah, it's a challenge.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:13):**  As long as there's still oil in the ground, people are going to mine it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:17):**  And that's still kind of a challenge with wild caught fisheries.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:21):**  But the price is coming down.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:23):**  One of the interesting things that happened over the last, let's say, six months with  
**[0:28:29-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:29):**  the price of petroleum skyrocketing is the affordability and uptake of algae based feeds  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:38):**  became a lot more affordable and has increased.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:43):**  There's been more use of it by more farms.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:45):**  And that's really helping scale.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:47):**  So the economies of scale are shifting.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:49):**  And that's something that we're really trying to promote is alternative feeds that are based  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:57):**  on things like algae, microalgae.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:28:59):**  But there's also single cell fermentation of various other organisms, bacteria and yeast.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:10):**  There's insects.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:11):**  So there's a whole evolution in the feed.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:15):**  And to just say that farmed fish are not as healthy as wild caught fish is one of those  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:20):**  generalizations that you just can't make.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:22):**  It's like saying that farmed tomatoes are not as healthy as wild caught tomatoes.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:28):**  Well, it really depends on where that wild caught tomato was planted and what it was  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:33):**  exposed to.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:34):**  And the same thing with the farm.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:37):**  How was it farmed?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:38):**  And then the question of health.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:40):**  Yeah, the nuance is, but the nuance in farming is not there either.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:45):**  You continue to see these diagrams of the impact of water consumption of a kilo of beef.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:53):**  And it's like, yeah, it sort of depends if that cow was outside in Ireland where it rains,  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:29:58):**  like how do you calculate the water?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:00):**  But just to leave that for another discussion.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:02):**  But then the natural question becomes, okay, if the fish gets their healthy omega-3 from  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:06):**  the algae, why don't just eat the algae directly?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:10):**  Or is there a transformation happening in the fish that makes it more accessible, more  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:14):**  absorbable, more tasty for sure?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:17):**  But what's the reason to have to sort of introduce that extra step?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:22):**  It could be a cultural thing.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:24):**  Could be we just don't need algae or it will take a while and we are eating fish.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:28):**  So let's use it as almost a vehicle.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:31):**  But what's your answer?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:35):**  I'm asking the very obvious questions.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:36):**  And later we're getting to the investment side of things.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:38):**  But what's the reason to use the fish as a vehicle for the omega-3?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:45):**  I think it's mostly just culture.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:48):**  I personally put a little bit of spirulina in my water and I take a couple of chlorella  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:53):**  tablets, but it's not that delicious.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:30:55):**  It's going to take quite a lot of work to make that more attractive for consumers to  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:01):**  eat.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:05):**  The conversion of that into fish creates ancillary benefits as well.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:11):**  So I think that if we're in this space of trying to create healthy food systems where  
**[0:31:19-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:19):**  we're raising commercially producing algaes to feed fish and shrimp and mussels and the  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:30):**  whole myriad of other species that can work together and create healthy ecosystems, it  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:35):**  also has the ancillary benefit to the environment.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:39):**  So the environmental services provided by a well-sited, integrated, multi-trophic aquaculture  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:47):**  or permaculture in the ocean benefits not just the end consumer that's eating it, it  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:53):**  also benefits the environment because it's cleaning the environment.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:31:56):**  It's creating a habitat for other wild and natural species and it's creating jobs and  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:03):**  economies.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:04):**  So I think that there's that multiplier effect when you create healthy food systems.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:11):**  Because that's, I think, the big piece here, to regenerate.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:13):**  I think we easily forget how, just as we forget on land, honestly, how degraded the land is  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:19):**  and how degraded the oceans are, how abundant they used to be.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:23):**  If you hear, not even so long ago, I think 100 plus years, how many fish there were in  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:28):**  the Mediterranean or how many fish there were, like the kelp forest in California.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:32):**  The stories are there, maybe they're a bit exaggerated, but even if they're half or 20%  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:36):**  of what they wrote, it must have been an extraordinary abundance of life.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:43):**  So there's a very strong argument that you just made, like how to restore that while  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:47):**  producing an economic outcome or while producing food that is being sold and bought and etc.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:32:52):**  And so that piece of regeneration, I think, is often forgotten in, okay, well, let's just  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:00):**  get some algae pills, because that's just not going to regenerate anything except for  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:04):**  maybe part of your body.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:06):**  So after working a couple of years with that fish farm, that word is doing, was doing the  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:14):**  right things and pushing on that, like what made you set up SeaTopia?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:19):**  Why was that a natural next step?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:22):**  It was a vision for the scalability of the distribution and transparent communication.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:32):**  So initially I was bringing these fish to farm to table restaurants throughout Southern  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:40):**  California.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:41):**  How difficult was it to sell it?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:44):**  It was very easy.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:47):**  Because why?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:49):**  The quality of the fish was so much better than the current system.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:33:54):**  So the seafood supply chain is really built on the concept of moving a highly perishable  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:00):**  commodity as quickly as possible.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:05):**  And that's generally done through multiple layers of resellers, master importers and  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:12):**  distributors and smaller distributors and just moving these commodities through these  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:17):**  buckets.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:19):**  And it's quite difficult with highly perishable items, especially when you're talking about  
**[0:34:24-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:24):**  wild caught seafood that sometimes is caught in unpredictable quantities.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:32):**  So for example, if a purse sanian boat comes across a breeding aggregation or spawning  
**[0:34:40-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:40):**  event and catches a massive breeding aggregation, it could be multiple schools coming together.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:49):**  And it catches an enormous quantity of pollock or cod or whatever, brings it to market, it  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:56):**  kind of floods the market with all this product.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:34:59):**  This fresh perishable product needs to move efficiently throughout the market.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:04):**  So what tends to happen is product doesn't have traceability because it's moving through  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:10):**  so many hands and being put into these generalized buckets where there's not a market for this  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:15):**  product.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:16):**  They sometimes are just going to rename it something else and just move it.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:18):**  There's a lot of studies that have quantified that the fish you get on your plate is not  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:25):**  the fish that's on the menu.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:28):**  It's a very high number.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:29):**  I think it's in the high 40s or even more.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:32):**  It's quite like one in two or probably more of the fish you order is actually not the  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:37):**  fish you order.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:42):**  Which is understandable in a commodity focused market that's just focused on shipping it  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:48):**  as fast as possible to plates because you lose the quality.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:53):**  It was easy to sell because you could very predictably get it to them obviously because  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:57):**  it's not that far.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:35:59):**  You know the slaughter schedule, let's say, because the harvest schedule because you know  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:03):**  when the fish are ready.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:05):**  I'm imagining the taste and quality was just very stable and off the chart.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:11):**  The quality was just much better than anything that was available anywhere else, especially  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:16):**  on a consistent basis.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:18):**  Then to Debut, we were bringing chefs to the farm.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:25):**  Bringing a chef to a farm where maybe they've visited a cattle farm or a pig farm and had  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:35):**  the experience of following the journey to their plate on those proteins.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:42):**  But to do it with fish was something that was out of sight out of mind for so many people.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:47):**  We created this authentic connection to where their seafood was coming from and gave them  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:53):**  the chance to swim in this aquarium.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:36:56):**  Swim with a school of 5,000 beautiful fish in crystal clear turquoise water.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:04):**  The experience was spectacular.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:07):**  It definitely worked.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:10):**  We were able to develop probably one of the most trusted specialty seafood distribution  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:13):**  businesses in Southern California because of this direct relationship with high quality  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:19):**  farms.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:20):**  Over the years, we started working with multiple farms in Mexico, Peru, and Chile.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:26):**  One at a time, bringing in these different relationships, trying to identify what are  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:29):**  the best farms in the world and bringing them to the best chefs.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:33):**  A lot of the Michelin star chefs and being based in Los Angeles, a lot of these celebrity  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:39):**  TV chefs were really stoked to work with the product that allowed their farm to table menu  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:45):**  to authentically also tell a story on their seafood.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:48):**  But the scalability of that model was actually quite limited because while there are a lot  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:37:53):**  of farm to table restaurants, there's very few national distribution channels for farm  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:01):**  to table products that can really move the needle.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:06):**  So as an example, one of the largest farm to table restaurant groups that we had brought  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:12):**  to the farm was a group called Tender Greens, which really cared about where their products  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:17):**  were coming from.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:18):**  But as Tender Greens grew, their business model changed.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:22):**  Instead of allowing each chef to make the decisions on their buying, it switched to  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:26):**  a national buyer.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:27):**  And then the national buyer was more conscientious of the volume discounts that were going to  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:32):**  be applied by choosing slightly different proteins.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:35):**  And then eventually it changed to being somebody that was probably more of like a controller  
**[0:38:42-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:42):**  or CFO and had less connection to the consumer's demands or concerns or different incentives  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:50):**  and motives.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:51):**  And that is one of the best examples of a farm to table restaurant group that we were  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:38:57):**  able to bring to the farm.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:00):**  The more middle of the road for restaurant groups, the disconnection happened really  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:05):**  soon and there just wasn't the same motive to get the most sustainable product as opposed  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:11):**  to save a million dollars a year by saving 25 cents per unit.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:17):**  So that challenge of who actually is the decision maker and who really cares always came back  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:24):**  to the consumer seems to care more.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:26):**  So I knew that a direct consumer model was going to get the product to the people who  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:32):**  care and create that feedback loop.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:34):**  So Cetopia was this idea that, well, maybe one day consumers will care enough about seafood  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:40):**  to be able to pay what it actually costs and get it to them delivered at home in an authentic  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:44):**  way that isn't just wrapping it in styrofoam and calling it sustainable seafood.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:49):**  So Cetopia was this idea that kind of was on the back burner and kind of like a business  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:39:54):**  plan that sat in a circle of friends for a number of years until COVID actually created  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:00):**  the impetus and the space to justify it.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:03):**  So as restaurants closed during COVID, you have these farms around the world that have  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:10):**  been investing in best in class feed and handling and low density farming.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:17):**  It's an expensive way to do it.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:18):**  And you have these living creatures in the water that require to be fed and they no longer  
**[0:40:23-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:23):**  had a sales channel because the farm table, the restaurants were not buying and these  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:33):**  fish needed to eat.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:36):**  So what's the future?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:37):**  The crystal ball didn't really have a vision for when those restaurants were going to come  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:42):**  back.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:43):**  So I really pushed the Cetopia model forward in order to continue to create a supply chain  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:50):**  that would continue to support and reward the farms that were really innovating.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:40:55):**  And the cool thing about it is that we've actually opened up a much better sales channel  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:03):**  that creates that feedback loop and is much more scalable.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:06):**  So the vision for Cetopia now is not just to support those handful of farms and continue  
**[0:41:12-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:12):**  to keep that going, but is to be a marketplace for farms around the world and eventually  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:22):**  be able to create the feedback loop for consumer demand and fostering regenerative aquaculture  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:29):**  on a global scale.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:30):**  So that's really where Cetopia has evolved to is creating this platform through this  
**[0:41:36-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:36):**  subscription model that gives a long-term investment and commitment to the farms that  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:43):**  we're going to keep buying these products and allow them to know for sure that there's  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:48):**  a buyer who cares and get that feedback.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:53):**  If a farm makes a change in their feed, how does that affect the taste?  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:41:58):**  If it doesn't really affect the taste, but it is better for the planet, do the end consumers  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:05):**  care enough to pay for that?  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:07):**  Well, if you're selling in a commodity sales channel where that nuance might not be told,  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:12):**  no, the answer is no.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:15):**  But if you can speak to your end consumers and we can put it in the newsletter and you  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:20):**  can host an event once a year where your consumers actually get to come to the farm and have  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:27):**  a dinner there and tell that story and be in the newsletter and have that information,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:32):**  yes.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:33):**  That's where the direct-to-consumer model allows a healthy relationship between aquaculture  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:42):**  and our relationship to seafood and end consumers.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:46):**  We've been able to do it actually in a quite authentic way where we deliver carbon neutral.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:42:55):**  We're actually partnered with an organization that's doing creating carbon credits through  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:01):**  open ocean kelp reforestation projects.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:05):**  We are investing a percentage of all of our profits back into ocean conservation through  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:14):**  the support of marine protected areas.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:16):**  We're shipping in totally eco-friendly packaging, no styrofoam.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:21):**  When we first started, we were doing completely no plastic, but we haven't yet been able to  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:25):**  come back to that because the compostable vacuum seal bags that we're using just aren't  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:31):**  quite up to quality yet.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:34):**  We're continuing to try to in.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:38):**  You're dealing with food.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:42):**  It is a food grade product that we were sourcing from a really cool company that was producing  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:47):**  it from Kosovo.  
**[0:43:50-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:43:50):**  But the challenge of keeping that plastic in close proximity to dry ice just didn't  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:00):**  preserve the product as well as we needed.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:02):**  We were losing the seal on the freezer-safe vacuum seal bags at too high a percentage.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:09):**  So we're continuing to invest in R&D on that side.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:14):**  There are some advancements on kelp-based plastics.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:18):**  Which would be ideal.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:20):**  From the story perspective and also from the circle perspective.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:24):**  But to get to that, you went from restaurant to direct-to-consumer forcefully.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:30):**  How ready was the consumer?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:33):**  You say we open a much bigger market, potentially, obviously.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:37):**  How has that been?  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:38):**  Has the consumer responded strong enough to keep the fish swimming and also to keep these  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:44):**  farms going?  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:45):**  Or did you have to scale down a lot?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:47):**  How has the response been?  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:51):**  Now we're talking the end of the summer 2022.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:44:54):**  How have those two years been basically in terms of consumer demand or consumer response?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:01):**  It's been really great.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:03):**  It's been overwhelmingly good.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:06):**  We haven't done any advertising and it just continued to grow.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:11):**  Mostly word of mouth.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:12):**  The biggest challenges are the logistics of the product.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:17):**  So we all know those challenges.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:20):**  But the model of working, scaling a CSA is really what we're doing.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:27):**  So who are the farms that have good relationships with processors or are in close proximity  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:33):**  to international supply chains?  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:36):**  We can put it onto a container and ship it and getting into a port that's not backlogged.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:42):**  Those are the biggest challenges for us.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:46):**  And as long as we're really methodical about which farms that we're supporting and can  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:53):**  predictably bring into our warehouse, it seems to be working pretty smoothly.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:45:58):**  We've had hiccups on the packaging and the vacuum seal bags and things like that.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:05):**  But the farms are really on board.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:09):**  There's not another market out there that is providing the feedback loops.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:14):**  We have the Whole Foods of the worlds.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:18):**  And I would say that they're pushing the envelope, but we're trying to be the forefront.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:24):**  We're trying to really be the thought leaders and create the most demand.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:29):**  So for example, we take a sample from every lot that we receive and send it to a laboratory  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:37):**  that quantifies the parts per billion, the presence of heavy metals.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:42):**  And we publish transparently the certificate of analysis and the mercury levels on our  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:51):**  fish.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:52):**  And we're doing that because A, it gives us information about whether there was a change  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:57):**  in the feed.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:46:59):**  It quantifies the health levels and it holds the farms accountable and gives the assurance  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:09):**  to the customers that this is absolutely a cleaner product than what you're going to  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:14):**  find anywhere else.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:15):**  And it is what they say it is.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:18):**  Not only does it come from a farm that has been quantified or certified by a third party  
**[0:47:27-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:27):**  audit for sustainability, but it's also been certified clean per the certificate of analysis.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:35):**  So what we're trying to do is really push a model that drives aquaculture as quickly  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:43):**  as we can towards those values that we believe.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:48):**  When I first heard about aquaculture, it was this potential solution to feed the world  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:55):**  a clean, healthy, sustainable food system.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:47:57):**  Well, what were the challenges that prevented that?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:00):**  And a lot of that surprisingly was not challenges with the ocean as much as it was challenges  
**[0:48:06-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:06):**  with the supply chain, the ecosystem, the economies and the incentives that were built  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:16):**  around it.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:17):**  And so we're trying to address those core issues in order to tell farms that there is  
**[0:48:24-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:24):**  a safe and healthy way that you can invest in best practices for advancing the innovations  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:32):**  on regenerative aquaculture practices.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:35):**  And do you see like these multi-species systems, the ideal permaculture one you mentioned,  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:41):**  is that on the horizon?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:43):**  Is it still very far away?  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:45):**  Is that maybe like that complexifying, which we talk often about on farms, is that something  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:51):**  happening or starting to happen, or is it okay, we really have to fix feed because that's  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:48:56):**  the biggest, by far the biggest lever for change, and then we look at other things?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:04):**  There are small scale farms doing it.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:08):**  There's a number of universities doing it.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:11):**  There are individual components being done.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:16):**  So for example, there's kelp farms being sited next to salmon farms because, so what you  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:24):**  talked about earlier, the manure or the effluent from a salmon farm is in high concentrations,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:31):**  a toxic nutrient that can create an unhealthy environment.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:38):**  But in nature, there's actually no such thing as waste, right?  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:42):**  So in nature, there's a symbiotic balance between that nitrogen and something else.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:50):**  And what is that in the case of siding kelp next to it?  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:55):**  The kelp is absorbing a lot of those nutrients.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:49:57):**  A shellfish farm, a sea cucumber farm, the scallops, all of these organisms have an ability  
**[0:50:08-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:08):**  to work with the finfish, but it's a matter of one, changing the model and creating the  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:19):**  incentives for those farms.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:20):**  So if you're a salmon farmer and you want to sell your products without fear that there's  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:29):**  a limit on the buyers, you're going to sell to the big commodity distributors.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:35):**  And they care about different things than...  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:39):**  Yeah, and consumers do.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:44):**  So what we're trying to do is say to that big farm, you have this other concession,  
**[0:50:52-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:50:52):**  you have this site where you could grow a brand that is synonymous with not only a healthy,  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:02):**  delicious salmon, but your brand could be synonymous also with your scallops and your  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:08):**  seaweed products and your mussels and your sea cucumber.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:13):**  And by having all those products under your brand, we will buy everything that you produce.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:21):**  And so that's kind of the sea topia model.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:24):**  So there are a number of farms that are experimenting with this and are taking that risk, but a  
**[0:51:32-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:32):**  lot of it comes down to just the risk factors for them, the business model and the incentives.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:40):**  And so what would you tell investors that are listening?  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:45):**  I mean, it's difficult to say what's the most neglected piece of the Regiment of Aquaculture's  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:49):**  place because it seems to be all relatively neglected.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:53):**  But where would you point them, obviously without giving investment advice, but what  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:56):**  would you be...  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:51:57):**  Let's say we're doing this on stage at a big ocean conference, where would you tell them  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:01):**  to go and dive or go and dig deeper to understand more?  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:05):**  Is it the algae space?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:07):**  Is that these multi-species together?  
**[0:52:09-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:09):**  Is it the CPG brands?  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:11):**  Or is it creating these distribution channels that reward these things?  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:15):**  What is your feeling most neglected in this space?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:21):**  I think you have to ask the consumer what they want and give that to them.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:29):**  So what does the consumer want?  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:31):**  The consumer wants to eat something that's delicious and healthy and sustainable.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:38):**  And right now what they're looking for is salmon.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:43):**  And where do they go?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:44):**  They go to Alaskan salmon because they've been told that wild caught Alaskan salmon  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:47):**  is the healthiest.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:50):**  But in reality, if you're going to put that product under the microscope and look at the  
**[0:52:58-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:52:58):**  mercury levels or the PCBs or the sustainability or the omega-3 levels, can you produce a better  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:08):**  product?  
**[0:53:09-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:09):**  I think you absolutely can.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:10):**  And there are farms doing it.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:11):**  So I would say that the best place for an investor to be looking is what are the products  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:24):**  that are meeting the consumer's need or getting closer to it?  
**[0:53:29-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:29):**  And how do we produce more of that?  
**[0:53:32-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:32):**  And I think that those products are the finfish.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:38):**  So what's limiting finfish is feed components.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:49):**  And not that it's not being done, but the unit economics aren't quite there yet.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:53):**  So how do we bring more scale to that?  
**[0:53:56-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:53:56):**  And education and transparency is one of those things, getting more awareness to the benefits  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:09):**  of aquaculture and the benefits of a regenerative aquaculture farm.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:16):**  So there's a lot of money, unfortunately, spreading misinformation about farms.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:23):**  And in some cases, it's well-served because there are a lot of commodity farms out there  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:28):**  that suck.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:29):**  And they're competing with artisan fisheries of people who have the best intentions to  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:36):**  be good stewards of their local waters.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:42):**  But it's doing a disservice to the advancement of aquaculture.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:48):**  So I guess I don't know if I answered your question because I don't have a clear answer  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:53):**  other than what we've been doing with Cetopia is really just focused on building a market  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:54:57):**  that's going to create those incentives for the farms and components that are supporting  
**[0:55:03-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:03):**  those farms.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:04):**  I believe that that's where I've put my energy because I felt like the biggest problem was  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:10):**  the delivery, the transparency, the feedback loops.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:16):**  And so to flip the question, because actually you get you give a very clear answer, but  
**[0:55:21-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:21):**  it is different if you're on that other side.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:24):**  So let's say you are managing a billion dollars and you had to put it to work.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:28):**  I'm assuming it's going to be in regenerative aquaculture.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:31):**  I'm asking this question not because I want to know a dollar amount, but I want to know  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:35):**  what would you prioritize?  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:36):**  Where would you spend most of your energy, in this case, quite significant resources?  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:42):**  If I were in charge of a billion dollar fund with a traditional, let's say, 10 year investment  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:47):**  structure, I would look at innovations around aquaculture technologies, monitoring, testing,  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:52):**  cleaning.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:53):**  Also look at supply chain logistics, like transportation, traceability, enabling software,  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:55:59):**  hardware, packaging that extends shelf life, reduces environmental footprint, and direct  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:04):**  consumer supply chains like Cetopia that connect farms directly to consumers and create this  
**[0:56:09-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:09):**  direct feedback loop.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:11):**  I'd also look at some mid to late stage investment opportunities with established farms or feed  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:16):**  manufacturers.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:17):**  But realistically, I'd prefer to manage maybe more like an evergreen fund with a structure  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:23):**  that can focus on the long term capital appreciation without time barriers, one that meshes well  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:29):**  with entrepreneurs looking to grow their businesses sustainably and truly foster regenerative  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:34):**  aquaculture.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:35):**  In that case, I would look at investments across the supply chain to drive real change  
**[0:56:39-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:39):**  in the dynamic of our relationship with the oceans with an investment thesis for creating  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:44):**  a true Cetopia on the blue planet.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:48):**  As such, I would be incentivized to invest in innovative feeds, in innovative aquaculture  
**[0:56:54-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:56:54):**  farms, advancing IMTA and RAS aquaponics and urban farming into retail brands, into processing  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:02):**  facilities, into packaging that extends the shelf life, reduces waste, and creates a circular  
**[0:57:08-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:08):**  economics, into the distribution, a global network of distribution hubs, education, there's  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:14):**  a ton of investment that needs to be done in education and testing and traceability.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:19):**  We need more testing, not only in aquaculture, but in wild caught products to create those  
**[0:57:25-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:25):**  right incentives.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:27):**  And in general management of our resources.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:30):**  So how would that allocation look at probably putting a lot into those innovative feeds  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:36):**  to help bring economies of scale to sustainable feeds produced from microalgae and bacteria,  
**[0:57:42-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:42):**  insects, yeast, and even invasive species, maybe let's say 15% allocation just in feed.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:50):**  Farms are really important though, we need to be developing more innovative farms and  
**[0:57:55-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:57:55):**  really helping bring IMTA, RAS, aquaponics and urban farming closer to the distribution  
**[0:58:02-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:02):**  centers.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:03):**  So probably upwards of 40% of that would go towards shrimp farms and salmon farms.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:10):**  Sablefish would probably be a little bit lower, Cetiola, Riviana, Quinteana, Llandi, all of  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:17):**  the jacks, the yellowtails.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:20):**  Sea breams, the snapper, the kimidai, the sea bass, scallops are really important, we  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:25):**  need more scallop farms, lantern baskets, scallop farms, oyster farms, kelp farms, seaweed  
**[0:58:31-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:31):**  farms, sea cucumbers, as we've mentioned, urchins, lobster, crab, lumpfish, bear mundi  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:38):**  and other underappreciated herbivores, and even maybe something like sardines.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:44):**  There's a lot of innovation that needs to happen on the farm.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:46):**  So that would probably be a big portion of that investment.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:49):**  But retail brands is also super important.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:52):**  Probably let's say 15% would be invested into retail brands to bring these products center  
**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:58:59):**  to the plate to reduce waste.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:01):**  And part of that would also, we would need advancements on processing.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:05):**  I would like to see, I would probably be investing in processing facilities that can make more  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:11):**  innovative products from the offal, from the livers, from the hearts.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:15):**  Making bone broths, seafood bone broths, I think would be a really amazing product line,  
**[0:59:21-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:21):**  more smoked products, more jerkies, more pet foods, just to reduce waste and to increase  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:25):**  profit margins across the supply chain.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:28):**  But then if we were looking at packaging, that would be probably a minority investment in  
**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:34):**  innovations on compostable bags and compostable insulations.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:39):**  There's some very innovative projects coming up with algae and mushroom and fish scales  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:44):**  to produce these sort of products, these insulations, these packaging.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:49):**  But distribution is really important.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:52):**  The cold chain distribution logistics, having a chain of distribution centers across the  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=0:59:58):**  United States and across the world.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:01):**  Innovation on AI assistant distribution, the last mile cold chain distribution is super  
**[1:00:05-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:05):**  important.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:06):**  It hasn't yet been defined who's going to be the Amazon of cold chain distribution.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:09):**  A lot of these, let's say, archaic cold chain warehouses haven't yet embraced innovations.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:18):**  Definitely not to assist the last mile on the direct consumer side.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:22):**  I'd love to see a lot more investment there.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:24):**  I would probably put a pretty significant investment there.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:26):**  It's 10% of our allocation.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:28):**  But education is going to drive a lot of this.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:31):**  Not as expensive, but it is exceptionally valuable.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:34):**  I think investments in documentary films, like The Biggest Little Farm was such a powerful  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:40):**  farm for education around permaculture and regenerative farming on land.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:45):**  We need the biggest little farm story for aquaculture.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:49):**  General media and education is going to be really important too in schools at the farm  
**[1:00:53-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:53):**  level and also policy, environmental lobby.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:56):**  We really need to see changes.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:00:58):**  The National Oceanic and Atmosphere Organization, NOAA, has really been trying to push aquaculture  
**[1:01:04-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:04):**  but has continued to affront this pushback from environmental groups.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:10):**  We need to have more education and lobby to help bring properly sighted, properly managed  
**[1:01:15-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:15):**  aquaculture closer to the markets.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:18):**  The US is still importing way more seafood than it should.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:23):**  Traceability and testing, I think that's going to help drive change across industry with  
**[1:01:27-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:27):**  heavy metal testing, toxicity testing, nutritional testing, the validation of those omega-3 levels  
**[1:01:34-1:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:34):**  versus omega-6 levels on labeling on every single seafood product.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:40):**  Traceability across the cold chain and fair trade certifications and certified sustainable  
**[1:01:45-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:45):**  certifications.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:48):**  We need a lot more of that.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:49):**  And I'm not just talking about within aquaculture.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:51):**  I'd like to see these sort of testings and certifications across wild caught seafood.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:54):**  I think that'll really help drive change.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:01:57):**  So yeah, hopefully that outlines a bit of my vision for how I'd invest a billion dollars  
**[1:02:05-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:05):**  because there is an enormous market in seafood and change needs to happen.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:11):**  But we need a sort of long-term vision on how to align our relationship to really create  
**[1:02:16-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:16):**  that sea topia.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:17):**  I think it's a perfect way to end this conversation.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:23):**  I want to thank you so much James for your time and for sharing.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:27):**  And I hope it's not the last time, first of all, we talk, but also where we look into  
**[1:02:31-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:31):**  regenerative aquaculture, regenerative ocean farming, because it's a very neglected, at  
**[1:02:37-1:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:37):**  least on our podcast for sure, space.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:40):**  And it's such an important one, such a potential one, not only because the potential in terms  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:46):**  of changes in practices, but the potential in terms of space.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:50):**  Obviously there's a lot of water, but also the potential simply in terms of biology,  
**[1:02:55-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:02:55):**  simply in terms of feed to food ratios, in terms of the quantity of biomass you can grow  
**[1:03:01-1:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:01):**  in 3D.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:02):**  I mean, the opportunities are truly magnificent.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:07):**  So I want to thank you for putting a spotlight on that today and for all the work you do.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:12):**  My pleasure.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:13):**  Thank you so much.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:14):**  I hope that I was able to articulate something of value to your audience.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:19):**  I feel like we kind of wandered all over, but at the end of the day, there's just so  
**[1:03:23-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:23):**  much nuance and so much story to be told.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:26):**  I appreciate you creating a forum for people to be asking these questions and learn a bit  
**[1:03:33-1:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:33):**  more and I hope that we can continue this conversation.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:03:36):**  Thank you.

**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:20):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:25):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:04:29-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:29):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:33):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:34):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:39):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:04:44-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:44):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:48):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:04:51-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:51):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:04:53-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:53):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:04:55-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:55):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:04:58-1:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:04:58):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[1:05:00-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:00):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:01):**  What should you read?  
**[1:05:02-1:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:02):**  What should you listen?  
**[1:05:03-1:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:03):**  What should you watch?  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:05):**  How to approach this space?  
**[1:05:07-1:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:07):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:05:09-1:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:09):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:11):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:05:16-1:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:16):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[1:05:21-1:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:21):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:26):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:28):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:05:31-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:31):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:05:36-1:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:36):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:41):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:05:42-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:42):**  No.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:43):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:45):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:50):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:05:55):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:00):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:03):**  Thank you.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:04):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:06:05-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:05):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:06:11-1:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:11):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:13):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:06:18-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:18):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:06:24-1:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:24):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:06:28-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:28):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:30):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:06:35-1:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:35):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:39):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:44):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:06:45-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:45):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:47):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:49):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:53):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:06:55):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/james-arthur-smith#t=1:07:00):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:13):**  What are microbial communities and why are they so important for all of us and especially  
**[0:00:18-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:18):**  if you are a farmer?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:19):**  Knowing what's happening in your soils is crucial but until recently it wasn't very  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:23):**  easy to look beyond the traditional nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium tests.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:27):**  And they don't tell the full story, actually far from that.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:30):**  It's way more interesting to look at the microbial activity and the microbial community  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:34):**  in your soil.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:35):**  But then we can test all we want.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:37):**  But how does it change our management?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:38):**  How does it change what I'm doing tomorrow morning?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:41):**  And how do I get a different outcome in a couple of months or at the end of the growing  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:45):**  season?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:46):**  That's what we unpack in this episode with the leading soil testing and interpretation  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:50):**  company.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:51):**  Finally, let's say a relevant use of AgTech.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:55):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:00:56):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:00):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:05):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:10):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:16):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:18):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:22):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:25):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:29):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:33):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:58):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of Biomakers, a global ag tech  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:03):**  company providing advanced technology for modeling soil functionality.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:07):**  They are on a mission to enhance the productivity of arable soils and recover soil health worldwide.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:12):**  Through their proprietary soil tech platform, B-Crop, they measure the biological quality  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:17):**  of the soil and deliver agronomic insights to optimize farm operations and output.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:21):**  Welcome Adrian.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:22):**  Hey, thank you, Coyen.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:24):**  Pleasure being here.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:26):**  And to start with a personal question we always love to ask, how did you end up founding or  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:31):**  co-founding a global ag company, ag tech company?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:35):**  Are you from a farm?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:37):**  Are you from a lab?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:38):**  What made you start in this specific sector?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:41):**  Well, as all entrepreneurial stories, this has been a long journey and a group of different  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:50):**  situations that at the end of the day bring us to create Biomakers.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:55):**  We are the founders.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:02:56):**  We are originally from the northwest of Spain where agriculture is really important.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:02):**  But before jumping into the agriculture, we decided to start doing business together by  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:07):**  leveraging the DNA sequencing technologies.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:10):**  And we opened the first genetic diagnostic center, specializing in hereditary diseases  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:16):**  and using DNA sequencing for detecting the predisposition to certain diseases, mainly  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:24):**  hereditary cancer.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:25):**  So you started with human health basically?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:28):**  Human health, that is the point.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:30):**  So personalized medicine and that was very, very big thing actually.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:36):**  But eventually we realized that there was a field very, very interesting and there was  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:41):**  a huge need in agriculture to utilize reliable bio-indicators.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:47):**  And because we knew a lot about specifically communities of microbes that we were also  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:53):**  analyzing for human health, we decided to sell the previous company.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:03:59):**  And we were lucky to be selected by the Illumina Accelerator Program in San Francisco, being  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:04):**  the first non-American company selling by the Corporate Accelerator Program.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:08):**  And that was the beginning of everything.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:10):**  We wanted to apply the personalized medicine concept into agriculture because there was  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:15):**  a missing piece in agriculture, which is considering biological activities in the decision making  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:23):**  process.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:24):**  It sounds very logical, but let's unpack it a bit because you could have run that company  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:28):**  probably for quite a bit more.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:30):**  I mean, there's a lot to do in personalized medicine.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:33):**  There's a lot to do in health.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:34):**  For sure, there's a lot to do in DNA sequencing there as well.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:37):**  I mean, you decided to sell, but it doesn't sound so obvious that you ended up in soil.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:41):**  Like, do you remember why when you and your co-founder started looking around, OK, what's  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:45):**  the next sector to take on?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:47):**  Why agriculture?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:48):**  Was there, is there a story there?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:50):**  Why you ended up looking at soil?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:51):**  You could also have looked at water or some other like animal health or something else.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:56):**  Yeah, there is always a trigger.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:04:58):**  And in this case, there were two triggers.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:00):**  One is connected to entrepreneurial experiences.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:03):**  Nobody talked much about failure, but in our case, we were growing with the other company,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:09):**  but we were not scaling.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:10):**  And we realized that the health sector, the industry, the market, our target market was  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:17):**  not ready to really accept a technology developed by young people because there are so many  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:22):**  white bear people in the sector.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:26):**  You mean doctors.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:29):**  So it happens that even having a cheaper and more trustable solution to diagnose the very  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:35):**  very cancer predisposition, they were not open to buy it widely.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:41):**  So and also we have a window, an opportunity window that we realized that it was that other  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:48):**  companies took over that space.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:50):**  And that was the perfect moment to start looking for alternatives.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:53):**  So you came to a sector where there's also a lot of older mostly white people managing  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:58):**  land.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:05:59):**  It's a lot easier, I think.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:00):**  But anyway, sorry, what was the second trigger?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:02):**  Being an entrepreneur is about challenging yourself and looking for the impossible.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:06):**  So the more difficult it is, the more challenging, the more fun it is.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:11):**  So yeah.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:13):**  That's what you keep telling yourself.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:15):**  Actually, there is a part of truth on that.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:17):**  They were risk takers and we really enjoyed that.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:20):**  Otherwise, what is the fun of life if you are not really posturing yourself?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:25):**  But there was another trigger and that happened.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:28):**  And we always tell this story.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:30):**  We have a dinner in a city called Toro, also very close to where we live or used to live  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:37):**  in Zamora.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:38):**  And we have dinner with winemakers.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:41):**  And we were the weird guys, you know, doing genetics, DNA sequencing.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:46):**  We were featuring some newspapers.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:49):**  And we started talking about their problems.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:51):**  And they were like, hey, would you be able to tell us what are the microbes doing the  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:55):**  fermentation?  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:56):**  And we were like, yeah, sure, but you know.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:06:59):**  And actually, we realized that they didn't know much about these interactions.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:03):**  I mean, there was really basic little knowledge about that.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:06):**  And even the origin of the microbes fermenting the wine, which is the vineyard, they didn't  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:12):**  have any source of data.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:13):**  And that was the trigger that put us the focus on agriculture because also start feeding  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:19):**  vineyards was really smart because this industry, these specific needs, they're really open  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:26):**  to innovation.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:27):**  And because they are open to innovation, they will help us to develop and do the proof of  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:33):**  concept.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:34):**  And in fact, that happened in winter 2014 when we were contacting different wineries.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:41):**  And they sent us soil samples, grape samples, liquid samples.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:45):**  And we started playing with those samples to see if we could first profile the whole  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:50):**  spectrum of microbes.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:51):**  And that was the beginning of everything.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:53):**  And with that idea, we went to the Illumina accelerator program.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:07:56):**  And after three months, starting conversations with them, they invited us to join the accelerator  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:02):**  in San Francisco.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:03):**  That was May 2015.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:05):**  Wow.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:06):**  And so let's unpack the wine side a bit.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:08):**  So the microbes, you mentioned it casually, but the microbes from the soil travel obviously  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:14):**  into the wine and they trigger the fermentation or how important is it to know what's happening  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:19):**  in the soil for a winemaker in the soil, in the fermentation tank, and then at the end,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:23):**  what ends up in the wine?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:24):**  Well, if you think about the winemaking industry, and it's one of the oldest industries beyond  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:30):**  agriculture, which is a little bit older, but the fermentation happens spontaneously  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:36):**  when you smash, crush the grapes.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:39):**  So the origin of those yeast and bacteria, well, should be somewhere.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:45):**  And there was a really interesting element in the wine sector that in Europe, people  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:51):**  choose or pick the wine not based in the grape variety, but based on the location.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:08:56):**  So it's not the same as Champagne wine, Bordeaux wine, or any other area or region in Europe  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:04):**  or Italy, Spain.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:07):**  And on the other hand, in US, they pick the wine based on the grape variety.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:14):**  So they don't consider much the origin.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:17):**  And there are some specific flavors connected to the origin, to the terroir.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:21):**  And that was like, okay, so if we understand the origin of the wines, of those flavors,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:27):**  that would be amazing.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:28):**  What happens is once we dive deeper on this idea, we realize that the wine growers are  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:34):**  facing different problems.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:36):**  It's not just on the fermentation side, but they face agricultural agronomic problem.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:41):**  So then we started to really help them to solve those questions.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:45):**  And also it happens that once you work on the agronomic dimension, you can scale to  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:50):**  any other problem.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:51):**  And so we're currently talking in, let's say, spring or late summer or late winter, winter  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:57):**  2022.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:09:59):**  It's a few years since 2015, which you mentioned.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:02):**  Where are you now in terms of biomakers?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:04):**  And what are you, I mean, you're still working with wine, but also many other things.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:08):**  Let's do an overview of where you currently stand and what you offer.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:12):**  Because you've come a long way, 70 people.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:14):**  I think you did a very serious series A. I mean, this is not a tiny startup in a scrappy  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:19):**  garage anymore, or I don't know if it ever was, but it's definitely not tiny anymore.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:25):**  And this is a journey where you're understanding what is the highest value that you can provide  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:31):**  with the technology that you are developing.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:33):**  So we started with the wine industry, developed a specific solution for them called WineSick.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:39):**  That was the first product that we launched.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:43):**  We got resources from investors from the U.S. and also from Europe, mainly business angels,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:50):**  that helped us to get there.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:53):**  And after launching the WineSick and starting getting traction, we wanted to really help  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:10:59):**  other crops.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:00):**  And then we came up with this concept called B-crop, because it's not about the microbes  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:05):**  that you have in the soil.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:07):**  It's about what they do in the same way that the microbes help us to live, to digest food,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:14):**  to care, to protect our skin, all kind of dimensions.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:20):**  In agriculture, it's pretty much the same.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:22):**  Microbes play a crucial role in everything related to plant growth.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:27):**  And the goal was to really go beyond the profile, the profiling, and also provide a functional  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:34):**  interpretation of this community of microbes.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:37):**  Because it's nice to know what's there.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:39):**  But then as a wine grower or any farmer, let's say I'm growing wheat, what do I do with that?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:44):**  Like what should I OK, I know now something.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:46):**  But what what does it tell me or what should I do different tomorrow morning?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:49):**  Well, soil has been always the dark boss where you throw something and some processes happen  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:56):**  there.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:11:58):**  Because we've been doing this for many years, we assume that is happening in the soil is  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:03):**  natural, right?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:04):**  But identifying specifically all the pathways and then measuring how active those pathways  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:11):**  are, it's extremely useful for a grower, for a farmer to really improve the way they manage  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:18):**  in terms of the spraying strategy, the inputs that they need to put into the soil, into  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:24):**  the field.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:25):**  And then to use the risks that they have, the quality of the crops that they are going  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:30):**  to get.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:31):**  And all these dimensions can be studied or identified through analyzing one of the most  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:38):**  interesting bioindicators in nature, which is the community of microbes.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:42):**  But also from a dual perspective.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:45):**  So the microbes, each microbe has a potential to develop different functions, let's say  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:51):**  pathways, no?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:53):**  But when these microbes stay in a community context, in an ecosystem context, then they  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:12:59):**  can play the role or not.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:02):**  And this is the ecological computing, the ecological intelligence that make us unique.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:07):**  And understanding the functional dimension, but also the ecological relationships of the  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:12):**  community.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:13):**  That's what brings us to the point where we are.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:16):**  So you're saying that studying one single microbe and understanding the different pathways  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:22):**  is relevant, but understanding his or her or its role within an ecosystem where they  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:29):**  can play the role or not is much more relevant because a single one in a lab isn't in its  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:34):**  natural habitat, let's say.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:35):**  So it's maybe not going to activate that pathway or do the work we would like it to do because  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:40):**  it's not part of the community.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:42):**  It's like there's a one plus one is three in that case, or one plus one is five or whatever  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:46):**  the number is.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:47):**  Like we need to study them together and understand what triggers them.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:51):**  Going back to triggers, what triggers them to do certain things?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:56):**  And that is exactly the point.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:13:58):**  So understanding these ecological relationships is crucial.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:03):**  Let me just give you an example.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:04):**  If I ask you where is the place where you will find highest risk to get infectious diseases,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:12):**  you will be surprised that is the place where the amount of pathogens in the environment  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:18):**  is the lowest one, which is a hospital.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:22):**  A hospital just have little microbes, pathogens, but those pathogens, if they get into your  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:28):**  body, then you have a serious problem.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:30):**  They're dangerous.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:31):**  It's the most dangerous place there is.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:32):**  I think Nassim Taleb said something like that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:35):**  Like avoid it.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:36):**  I mean, obviously, you're dying, go, but if you're at the risk about anything else, stay  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:40):**  away from the place where it's been sprayed a lot.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:44):**  Most of the things are killed and the ones that do survive could be very, very dangerous  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:47):**  for you.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:48):**  And you're saying that's, I mean, taking the analogy to a field, the ones that have been  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:52):**  sprayed heavily or worked heavily is potentially the most risky place.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:57):**  Is that what you're hinting to?  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:58):**  Could be, could be.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:14:59):**  So that's what we started to understand when we add these algorithms or develop the algorithms  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:07):**  related to the ecological computing.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:09):**  We are applying, in a sense, the same technology.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:12):**  And this is what is magic today that the computing capabilities are amazing and there are many  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:16):**  developments that have been applied in other sectors as banking or even Facebook to anticipate  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:23):**  to predict what is the behavior of the people based on the connections or their community.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:28):**  So we are applying the same logic, this computing intelligence to really understand what are  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:34):**  the correlations between the different microbes in the community and also the potential to  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:39):**  develop different functions.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:42):**  And when we say functions, just for the audience to have some specific examples, we're talking  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:46):**  about risk, disease risks.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:49):**  We are talking about stress, adaptors, hormone producers and nutrient mobilizations in essence.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:15:56):**  And of course, providing an overall understanding on the biological status of the soil is also  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:03):**  very interesting, very useful.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:05):**  And so can you walk us through like a typical use case or a farmer growing, what crop he  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:11):**  or she will be growing?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:12):**  How did they get analyzed?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:13):**  Do they have to send a number of soil samples?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:15):**  How many?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:16):**  How would a farmer go through a process when he or she joins and becomes a customer of  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:20):**  your company?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:21):**  Yeah, the idea here is first to digitalize what is happening in the soil, what is the  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:27):**  soil functionality, the status of the soil in a specific farm.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:31):**  Do you get sort of a ranking then?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:32):**  Like do you get, I'm okay or I'm in green or I'm actually yellow in certain areas?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:38):**  Some people want to know that, but most of people come with a specific question.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:44):**  Those questions are, for instance, why this area has a lower yield than this other area.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:51):**  And they are not able to identify the reason for traditional parameters.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:55):**  So biology is going to probably give them the answer.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:16:58):**  And we have plenty of examples of them.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:01):**  Then we have also many farmers that are transitioning to certain practices.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:06):**  We know that now many people is moving into regenerative agriculture or greener agriculture,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:11):**  you know, different practices, especially because of the prices of agrochemicals.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:15):**  They are so high.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:17):**  So they need to be smart and try different studies.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:20):**  And they want to monitor because at the end of the day, this is a business and they want  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:24):**  to monitor what is happening and to check if there is an improvement.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:28):**  Because by partnering with the biology of the soil, then you can really save a lot of  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:34):**  money in inputs because probably you don't need it.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:37):**  And we have a really nice example in Brussels sprouts that we have a farmer and he was the  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:44):**  one, his agronomist was telling us, Hey, I've done a physical chemical soil test as the  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:50):**  amount of phosphorus and potassium.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:53):**  So physical chemical soil test is the normal, the standard solution.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:56):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:57):**  It's a standard one.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:17:59):**  And they measure the phosphorus and potassium and it was so high and he didn't know what  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:03):**  to do because the crop, the Brussels sprouts were not performing so well.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:09):**  So he was like, Oh, there is a disease, there is something.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:12):**  And at the end, what he had, it was a block in the metabolic pathway of the phosphorus  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:18):**  and potassium mobilization.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:20):**  So the microbes were not feeding the plant, making that nutrient available while the nutrient  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:26):**  was there.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:27):**  So in order to improve the blockage, what they did is well, first they stopped adding  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:34):**  this fertilizer because they already have it.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:37):**  So they saved something like 20% and they use that money for a biological input to increase  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:45):**  a bio-stimulant and to unlock that pathway.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:48):**  Suddenly their yield increased by 8%.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:52):**  So spending the same amount, just doing a couple of tests in that specific field, they  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:57):**  knew what to do.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:18:58):**  So this is the obvious outcome.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:01):**  And then the next year, you, I mean, the fertilizer is still there, the bio-stimulant, maybe you  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:05):**  need less or maybe you do a different one.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:07):**  Like you can go on a transition there.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:11):**  The idea is just to keep monitoring what is happening and well, what we're providing is  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:15):**  a digital tool at the end of the day.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:17):**  And so a farmer has like this Brussels sprout farmer, how does the sampling work?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:22):**  How do I get measured for my field to have to dig and send it like just for anybody that's  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:28):**  never done soil sampling, how does it work in practice?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:31):**  It's so easy.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:33):**  Usually what you do is you collect a little soil, a little spoonful of soil from different  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:39):**  points all across the field, all across the block.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:42):**  Do you need GPS data on that?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:44):**  Do you need some kind of localization?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:46):**  You can have them depending on the size.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:48):**  We have a tool that will tell you specifically where you need to sample.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:51):**  Okay, so, but it does not usually they more or less know.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:19:56):**  And that tool to tell me is based on satellite data or how do you tell me where to, and you  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:00):**  do a sort of analysis of, okay, this is the minimum number of samples on this troubled  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:05):**  field because usually I come with a question, obviously like this field, there's something  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:08):**  wrong and you would tell me, okay, you need four spots more or less there to have a good  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:13):**  understanding of what happens because then you extrapolate, I'm imagining.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:17):**  The idea is not to ask them to do so many tests.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:19):**  I mean, I wish they will do so many, but just what they really need and the resolution of  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:25):**  the data that they need to answer the question they have.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:27):**  Unless they want just to build a bio map of the field, which is another question that  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:32):**  they come and see this differences.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:34):**  So they can start spraying more smartly.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:39):**  Now there are plenty of robots that will do precision spraying based on the prescription  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:45):**  that you put on the robot.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:48):**  So yeah, the sampling process is you just go in centimeters, like five to 15 centimeters  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:55):**  deep so you don't want to suffice.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:20:57):**  You want to capture the community of microbes that is going to be more relevant in terms  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:01):**  of providing information on what's happening in the field.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:04):**  You average what is happening in that field.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:07):**  You don't want one specific point, at least three, so you can have a good understanding  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:11):**  what is the status of that field and you send the soil sample, which is really small, I  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:18):**  would say, to one of our labs or partner labs.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:21):**  And then the process, the magic happens.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:23):**  We profile the whole spectrum, all the bacteria, all the fungal species.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:28):**  But what you get at the end of the day through an app or a web portal is all the functional  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:33):**  data to really make an action.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:36):**  And you mentioned there are quite a few, of course, that's what we're talking about in  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:40):**  this podcast as well, let's say on the regenerative journey or in a transition to cut maybe most  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:45):**  of their inputs or replace them for some biological or integrating animals, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:51):**  What is an interesting example you have there from a farmer that is pushing the boundaries,  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:21:55):**  let's say, of what's possible and is using you to monitor that and to make adjustments?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:00):**  Do you have a, I wouldn't say a cool example, like an interesting example for the audience  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:03):**  to share there?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:04):**  Well, as you can imagine, there are plenty of weird and cool examples and different situations.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:12):**  Not all of them actually are positive.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:14):**  I mean, we're data providers and not everybody's happy with the data that we provide, or at  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:18):**  least they don't get the data that way they expect.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:21):**  And sometimes they challenge the technology.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:23):**  And once you just start analyzing and, you know, trying to find why, then they understand  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:29):**  that, OK, now I get it.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:31):**  So what I was thinking that it was good for my field actually is not as good as I was  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:35):**  thinking.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:36):**  That's one of the...  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:37):**  I was hoping, yeah, as the company who was selling me this magic potion was promising  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:42):**  me to do, or my amazing combos might not be so amazing.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:46):**  It's quite confrontation, obviously, if you go that deep.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:49):**  Well, that's one of the aspects that we started to work, one and a half year ago, was profiling  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:22:56):**  the effect of the different inputs and the different practices.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:00):**  Because as you mentioned, we're living in a very interesting momentum where we see so  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:04):**  many biological inputs available and many startups, many companies delivering new solutions  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:10):**  into the market.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:11):**  Still, there is room for... there is many unsolved problems.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:14):**  But the point is that there was no way to really differentiate those inputs.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:19):**  And this is crucial.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:20):**  So by designing a proper analytic program, we can really isolate what is the impact caused  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:29):**  by the application of the specific input or the deployment of a specific farming practice.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:36):**  And this is extremely useful because then you have, on one hand, let's say the diagnosis.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:40):**  So you see what is the functional status of the soil.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:43):**  And then you have profiled all the solutions that potentially could match that profile  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:49):**  to improve.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:50):**  And then by building predictive models on what is the most suitable product, you can  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:55):**  make a matchmaking between a field and a solution.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:23:59):**  And this is what we're working on our R&D side.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:02):**  Last year, we did the proof of concept in potatoes with a specific biological.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:09):**  And now we're testing other solutions to really hopefully release this tool, this prescriptive  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:16):**  tool for agronomists, because otherwise it's going to be really difficult for them to identify  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:21):**  what is the most interesting inputs for their clients.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:25):**  Yeah, because it really feels like the Wild West at the moment of input companies.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:30):**  I mean, we get at the podcast, obviously a very different position, but we get approached  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:34):**  a lot by input companies promising the stars and the moons and a lot more because their  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:39):**  input is working on all crops is magical, et cetera.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:43):**  We usually don't profile them or don't interview them because it's very difficult, exactly  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:46):**  the problem you described, to understand what is working and what is the noise between and  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:51):**  what's the interesting piece.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:52):**  Because for sure, one in 10 is super interesting, but most of them potentially are not.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:24:56):**  And as we are not testing that at all, we try to stay away from the input side of things.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:00):**  I'm sorry for everybody listening that is running an amazing input company is simply  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:04):**  because we cannot select or we cannot filter.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:06):**  And I think for farmers, that must be the same.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:08):**  I mean, they get approached every other day by this is going to change all your growing.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:12):**  This is going to end.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:13):**  It's quite expensive usually, and it very often doesn't work because of the context  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:17):**  or because of what is in it.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:19):**  So I think it's absolutely essential to start testing these things as we have done in the  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:23):**  chemical space much more, but not necessarily on the input side.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:27):**  And of course, farmers are also making a lot of things or starting to make things themselves  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:31):**  or applying things with neighbors, etc.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:34):**  And a lot of the time, the proof of the working isn't really there.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:37):**  So we need a lot of research there.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:40):**  So we wanted to become the independent company, the neutral company, providing data reliable  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:47):**  insights on what are the activity patterns of each solution that is available into the  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:54):**  market.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:55):**  And we want those companies to really understand what is their market and what is their unique  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:25:59):**  legacy.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:00):**  So who is the client, the company or the farmer?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:03):**  The input manufacturer.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:04):**  The company is OK.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, actually, we are working not as many with farmers.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:10):**  I mean, there are some of them that come to us, but usually we work with retailers and  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:15):**  agronomists because at the end of the day, they are the ones prescribing the solutions  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:19):**  or the actions in the field in most of the cases.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:22):**  And on the other hand, we are working with input manufacturers.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:25):**  Currently, we have like 80 companies testing their solutions, their inputs with the big  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:32):**  crop technology, which is great because at the end of the day, this is a great learning  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:37):**  exercise for them to understand their solution, to understand their market, and also to provide  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:43):**  functional claims that have been verified externally.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:47):**  Because I mean, agronomists and retailers and even the farmers, they don't trust anymore.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:52):**  The picture with the product, without the product, not everybody's using that.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:56):**  So you don't trust it anymore.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:58):**  Do you?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:26:59):**  What do you think?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:00):**  Photoshop?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:01):**  And Photoshop is good.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:04):**  No, no, I mean, it's I mean, it's very I mean, I remember what was it that groundswell,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:10):**  I think two or three years ago.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:12):**  And there were a lot of stands and everybody promised like amazing results.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:17):**  But of course, to actually know, to actually show proof, and to actually have some kind  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:23):**  of independent party or company showing like the effectiveness on specific fields and crops,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:28):**  because they're so different.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:30):**  And it depends so much on your context and on your soil, if something even kind of be  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:33):**  effective.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:34):**  So that's an extremely relevant thing.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:36):**  Do you have plans to bring that beyond potatoes?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah, actually, we are doing it in most of the crops that are relevant right now.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:44):**  We have a I would say something like 130 crops that are active in our database.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:50):**  And we're testing close to 100 different solutions in different crops from coffee, bananas.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:56):**  And other what are the results?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:27:58):**  Are they very, are they potentially very, I mean, are some companies very disappointed  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:03):**  when they see it?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:04):**  And how do you are you going to share that?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:05):**  Do you share that publicly?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:07):**  Or you just not recommend them to farmers or agronomists?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:10):**  No, actually, we're not sharing it publicly because we're doing this, let's say, for them  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:16):**  to understand what is the impact of their inputs.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:19):**  The idea is that not far in the time we'll be able to tell a farmer if a specific solution  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:26):**  is matching their field and is going to help them to increase their functionality, the  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:30):**  performance of, in this case, the soil being kind of automatic or data-driven prescription  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:36):**  tool.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:37):**  That's what they're working in, but yeah, we don't share publicly unless the client  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:42):**  wants to open it.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:43):**  And we have some papers, some publications that are available from different companies  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:48):**  presenting the results that we use.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:50):**  And actually, many of our clients are using our results in their shows because now they  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:54):**  see that it's a potential.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:28:56):**  And also, they are using the functional claims that we provide for registration purposes,  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:02):**  which is also very interesting.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:04):**  And where do you, looking at that space of the input space, where do you get most excited  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:09):**  or where are the biggest gaps?  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:10):**  What are things that you see like nobody's working on that and somebody should?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:14):**  Yeah, biostimulants and crop protection.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:17):**  There I think we have a huge opportunity on biologicals.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:22):**  There is legislation that is evolving to make it, well, let's say, more reliable whenever  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:29):**  there is a registration of crop protection.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:32):**  But we see certain solutions that are, they have really multi-approach or multi-dimensional  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:41):**  impact in the field.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:43):**  So they stress the plant and they stimulate the plant and they unlock certain pathways  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:49):**  that will increase the resistance of the plant and at the same time reduce the risk, the  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:54):**  natural, the environmental risk on a specific disease.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:29:57):**  So yeah, yeah, agriculture is becoming really complex.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:01):**  So it's not just about feeding the soil anymore.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:04):**  It's about really looking from a multi-dimensional approach.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:08):**  And do you see some of your farmers that are, let's say, very advanced in terms of soil  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:13):**  health and maybe use very little inputs from outside, maybe make some of the brew, some  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:17):**  of their bio-fertilizer, et cetera.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:19):**  How are those soils?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:20):**  Are they extremely active like soils that don't need too much or are you mostly working  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:24):**  with farmers that are on the journey somewhere and still need quite a bit of input?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:29):**  We work with all kinds of farmers because let's say the standard classification of farmer  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:36):**  is the conventional farmers at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:39):**  They might be more or less reluctant on certain practices but they know that the biology is  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:44):**  going to help them to increase the performance of the crop.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:47):**  So they want to really analyze and they really look at the cost structure, the efficiency  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:30:53):**  because they spend a lot in inputs and they expect a high efficiency on that cost.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:00):**  On the other hand, we have those more regenerative farmers.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:05):**  Some people look at them kind of hippie style but it's far from there.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:11):**  They are data geeks.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:13):**  They get really serious.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:15):**  They test all kind of ideas and some of them work really well and others not as much.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:22):**  For instance, cover crops is a really hot topic right now especially in regenerative  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:27):**  agriculture but what we've seen is that not all the cover crops works in the same way.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:32):**  Some of them are really positive for the field, for the crop, for the soil and others are  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:37):**  not as positive because at the end of the day, any action that you do in the field,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:41):**  you are making an intervention.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:43):**  You are specializing the community, driving the community in a certain direction and the  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:49):**  idea is that we could control that direction better.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:52):**  Right now, while we are in the experimental stage.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:31:58):**  It's very interesting the type of cover crop.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:01):**  Like always, the tree could help but it depends how or the animal could help but it definitely  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:06):**  depends how and now it seems like the cover crop could help but it definitely depends  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:10):**  how.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:11):**  Have you seen that?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:12):**  There's an effect of complexity.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:15):**  We can steer the microbes obviously or the community in a certain direction but if you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:19):**  have a very, very diverse, I mean you hear the gurus in the space like the gate browns  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:23):**  etc.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:24):**  They go for 15 or 20 types because simply they maybe don't do this analyzation and they  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:27):**  don't know which one will work so they just do as many as possible and by that, let's  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:32):**  say have the microbe community to be as diverse as possible.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:36):**  Is that complexity versus simplistic approach?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:39):**  Is that something you've seen?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:40):**  The more diverse, the better or can you do with research actually select the three cover  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:45):**  crop types you need to actually push the soil?  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:47):**  It's a very big, difficult question.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:49):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah, well this is a really tricky question because is general accepted that a higher  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:32:59):**  abundancy or diversity of microbes is better for the agriculture?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:05):**  If you think about sustainability versus productivity, there is probably some conflicted interest  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:11):**  or relationship.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:13):**  So not always a higher diversity means a higher yield but you can find a really resilient  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:22):**  and diverse community of microbes developing different functions so a certain level of  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:27):**  a specialization of that community that is going to make the field really productive  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:31):**  or let's say a level that is reasonable and feasible from the economical point of view  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:36):**  for the farmer and at the same time is going to be positive from the environmental point  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:41):**  of view.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:42):**  Somebody talks about changing or turning carbon emission or carbon intensive agriculture into  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:48):**  carbon sequestration agriculture or carbon capturing agriculture.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:52):**  This is possible and we can get a really high yield performance on the crop and at the same  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:33:59):**  time sequester carbon.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:00):**  That's possible but by looking at the diversity of microbes is not the best indicator.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:06):**  It's not always the best indicator.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:08):**  Now it's very interesting.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:10):**  I think there's a natural focus of the ag community until now for yield, yield, yield,  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:15):**  yield, yield without asking the question of what it actually costs to get that yield meaning  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:19):**  input.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:20):**  We would never ask that question to a factory like okay you have a bike factory and how  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:24):**  many bikes can you push out?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:25):**  You say no I can push like a hundred thousand per week if I do three shifts and I run on  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:30):**  diesel generators and I push my people to the end but my costs will be close to break  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:36):**  even and probably would lose a bit of money.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:38):**  In agriculture the only thing we look at is yield and very hardly we push like okay what's  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:43):**  the yield instead of actually what's the cost and the yield and you're saying there is an  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:46):**  optimum in many places where you might not have the absolute best yield of the area but  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:51):**  you have way lower costs and way more resilience in your soil and potentially also storing  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:34:57):**  carbon and a lot of other yield let's say but pushing only for the yield number is probably  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:01):**  not the best proxy for success of a farm or success of a field.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:06):**  That's right.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:07):**  But agriculture has received the pressure to be the one delivering food for the whole  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:11):**  planet and that pressure is increasing so they have to deliver food.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:16):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:17):**  That's what we expect but that practices that you mentioned has taken away one third of  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:24):**  the arable soil because the intensity so probably we could have done things in a different way  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:28):**  and now is the moment to really start playing and understanding this.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:33):**  In 2020, just before the pandemic, we launched an initiative called Fields Forever to provide  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:41):**  open access to our technology to researchers and those farmers doing experiments with the  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:47):**  target of understanding soil health or to see what is happening.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:35:53):**  So far we have supported more than 200 initiatives globally in different countries and if you  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:00):**  see the outcomes from those initiatives, some of them are really small.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:04):**  It's an individual farmer who is testing something specific and we saw that, okay, this is a  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:10):**  very innovative approach.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:11):**  We want to support your initiative and others are researchers that have really large projects  
**[0:36:17-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:17):**  to understand the differences, the characteristics of the soil in different latitudes for instance.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:25):**  And all the results, all the conclusions coming from there at the end take us to the point  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:30):**  that now we have data, we have tools, it's the moment to really evolve the way we farm,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:38):**  keep it productive, even recover soil.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:40):**  This is something we are working in certain areas with certain companies like the desert  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:45):**  in Peru.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:46):**  So you can turn desert soil into arable soil and that's extremely interesting because you  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:52):**  increase the value of the land and at the same time you make it productive in terms  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:57):**  of agriculture.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:58):**  So that's also possible.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:36:59):**  We just need to plant it and use the tools in a good way.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:03):**  So there are a lot of options out there.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:07):**  There's a lot of work to do.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:08):**  Now I have to think of when you mentioned the specific microbes a bit back.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:12):**  I will link the interview below, the one we did with Dan Barber who was mentioning, Chef  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:16):**  Dan Barber, who was mentioning he found or one of his breeders because he's very much  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:21):**  into seeds and genetics.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:22):**  One of his breeders found a type of corn that was fixing his own nitrogen and of course  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:28):**  with microbes because they never do it by themselves, but only did that in healthy soils  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:32):**  or very abundant.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:33):**  So we've never seen it in practice until somebody decided by accident probably to plant because  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:39):**  it's a feeder corn.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:40):**  It's not even meant for us to eat, but he said, I really want to cook with it.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:43):**  I want to see it because it's been and I want to test it as well on the nutrient density,  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:47):**  but it only expressed this quality when it was put into a diverse microbial soil where  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:52):**  these microbes were actually able to feed the nitrogen to that without having the need  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:56):**  of the fertilizer.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:37:57):**  And not because this is perfect, but it just opened my eyes at least like the amount of  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:02):**  things we don't know yet, like the amount of possibilities here, the amount of plants  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:05):**  that have not expressed something that they could because they are planted in not the  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:10):**  right type of soil or the right type of field or the soil is not adapted to them or the  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:14):**  microbes are simply not there or the microbes are blocked to actually provide this to them.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:18):**  Like the amount of possibilities here on yield, but also on quality are probably endless because  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:24):**  we've blocked so many of these pathways by spraying and by input rightfully so because  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:28):**  we needed to fix for hunger.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:30):**  I mean, we've done that.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:31):**  We've produced way more food at the moment than we need or way more calories in the wrong  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:34):**  places most of the time.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:36):**  And we throw away 30 to 40%.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:38):**  And so, but it's not a question of can we produce the quantity, but it's a question,  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:42):**  how do we produce the quantity and how do we produce what we actually need ourselves  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:46):**  to, no, actually not what we need to feed our microbes in ourselves to stay healthy.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:50):**  So it's a very interesting opening up of pathways, I think.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:54):**  And what do you, I mean, it feels like we're early and not early at the same time in this  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:57):**  transition.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:38:58):**  What would you tell, obviously I always have to say without giving investment advice, but  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:02):**  what would you tell smart investors that are listening to the show or if we would, I like  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:06):**  to say the last few months, I've been saying it a lot.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:08):**  If we would be in a theater and we do this on stage.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:10):**  So we're both sitting on stage, we have a nice microphone.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:12):**  It's a nice old theater full of interesting and interested people.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:16):**  And they walk out after hearing this, this conversation, they've asked some questions  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:20):**  and what would you tell them to do the next morning?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:22):**  Where should they start looking?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:23):**  Is that the bio-stimulants that you mentioned, or is it something completely different?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:27):**  Where would you push them to build things and invest in things?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:30):**  Well, actually if you look at the trends, I think we're going in the right direction.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:36):**  There is a lot of room for opportunity for new solutions, new inputs, biologicals out  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:42):**  there and still new solutions to come.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:45):**  So I will encourage to really take a science-driven approach on anything that is looking at or  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:53):**  what they are assessing, but really looking at those solutions because that could be very  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:39:58):**  important and relevant for the future and for the industry and will bring some returns.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:03):**  Also, closing the loop from what everybody talks about farm to farm, but I think still  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:10):**  there is a distance between the farmer and all the distribution channels and the consumer.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:17):**  So probably bringing or making smaller these gaps is going to be very interesting.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:23):**  Technology is working in that field.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:25):**  I would say those are relevant and needed.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:28):**  You see every day that when you go to the supermarket, you are buying some fruit that  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:33):**  has been packaged somewhere in the world and has been produced at the other side of the  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:37):**  world.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:38):**  So probably it's, I mean, independently of the cost, we can do it really cost-effective  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:43):**  and closer.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:44):**  So those technologies I think are really, really relevant.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:49):**  And then carbon, I think it's a really stringent good opportunity and there is a lot of homework  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:54):**  to be done.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:40:55):**  I will note, we're not there yet on measuring or getting a good estimation on what is happening  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:02):**  in the field in terms of the amount of carbon that we sequester or the bioactivity that  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:07):**  is happening around the carbon.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:09):**  How is that connection between the soil microbial activity and the carbon capture?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:13):**  Is it something you see?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:14):**  Is it something you say, we see it, but we don't fully understand it?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:17):**  How far are we in that from your perspective of analyzing so many soil samples?  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:22):**  Well, there are people really trying to get a good understanding.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:26):**  So right now, most of the tools either measure the biomass, the plant biomass in terms of  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:34):**  carbon, and also based on certain practices, they make an estimation of the carbon.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:39):**  The model.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:41):**  Which is an estimation, probably it's not as accurate.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:42):**  We could do better.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:43):**  That's the point.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:44):**  And nobody is looking at the microbial biomass.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:47):**  Which is the one that's carbon.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:50):**  That's where the carbon is.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:52):**  And there is also a transfer in terms of carbon in the soils or release and capturing and  
**[0:41:57-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:41:57):**  understanding what is the total capacity and the long-term storage capacity and the processes.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:05):**  I think there is room for that.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:07):**  And then enabling a mechanism to reward those farmers that are really helping.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:12):**  I think this is going to be very interesting from the public entities because right now  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:16):**  we see all the governments supporting agriculture and probably we can design some mechanism  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:20):**  to compensate those farmers that will go straight from the polluters to those not polluting  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:27):**  and also in agriculture, turning from a carbon-intensive agriculture to a carbon-sequestering agriculture.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:33):**  I think that's crucial.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:34):**  Is it something you see yourself moving into?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:37):**  Not the credit side, but the testing side?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:38):**  Is it something that is actually possible with the tests you're doing now?  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:42):**  Like that capacity of soil carbon capture, which is different than the actual carbon  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:47):**  captured obviously.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:48):**  Is that capacity because it's so closely linked to microbial activity or that's like a next  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:52):**  generation of tests that you need to like the labs you're using, is that something you  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:42:55):**  can or it's not there yet or you decided to not look into that yet?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:02):**  Micro-ops are going to provide a part of the data that we need to make that estimation.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:07):**  But the good thing is that the rest of the data is already available because there are  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:10):**  plenty of data sources.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:12):**  So actually we're working on getting an estimation.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:15):**  But again, everything we do at Biomakers is science-proof or has to be validated somehow.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:23):**  It should be able to demonstrate that this is something you can trust that is reliable.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:27):**  So and that's the reason because we haven't jumped in.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:30):**  Under the Fields Forever, we're supporting some projects that are working in this specific  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:35):**  direction.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:36):**  We want to first understand what are the carbon dynamics in the soil and then we are correlating  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:42):**  this with the current models to estimate the carbon sequestration.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:46):**  And this is how we're getting a good understanding of the amount of soil, the dynamics of the  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:51):**  carbon in agriculture and eventually we'll be able to connect the value of our tests  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:43:57):**  or our digital solution with an estimation of the carbon.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:00):**  And then for sure there should be some certification mechanism that will work with other companies.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:06):**  We are really an open innovation entity.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:09):**  We love collaboration and we know that we cannot change the world by ourselves.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:12):**  So that's the reason because we embrace partnerships.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:15):**  And where do you see this the soil testing market go in terms of is it currently accessible  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:21):**  for all farmers?  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:22):**  I mean, you mentioned obviously your Fields Forever process, but in terms of cost, this  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:27):**  is one of the classical technical exponential cost curve that just keeps going down or is  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:32):**  this lab that you're using that might be yours or a partner lab, like you mentioned, like  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:36):**  those costs are sort of fixed and it's maybe the software part that comes after that could  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:40):**  get that could scale and does get cheaper.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:42):**  Like, where do you see this?  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:44):**  Is this going to be something that we just do all the time?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:47):**  That's completely like, I don't know, like fast as we currently do in COVID.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:51):**  Like that cost curve, where do you see that going for the market or where do you in your  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:55):**  company?  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:44:56):**  Well, there are obviously economies of scale with these new markets because this is a new  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:02):**  market that we are building and we're pushing and we are also how leading as well.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:10):**  Cost is not a barrier for farmers to adopt it because they see the value on that.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:15):**  And it's not just getting data that are cool.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:17):**  It's about really gaining efficiency on whatever you are spending.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:21):**  You mentioned the cost structure in the farms.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:24):**  Keep in mind that the fertility, the efficiency of fertility, chemical fertilization is around  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:30):**  30 percent, meaning that if you throw one kilo of agrochemicals, just 30 hundred grams  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:36):**  will go into the plants.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:38):**  What happened with the rest?  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:39):**  That's a lot of money that you are pouring there.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:41):**  Now, so probably if you start playing with the biology, you can save a lot of money,  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:46):**  increase the efficiency and have a higher yield.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:49):**  So the value that you get is always higher than the cost.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:52):**  Otherwise it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:45:54):**  And we also have promised that we'll fix the price, but we'll keep adding features to our  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:02):**  solutions as we know more and more on what is happening in the community and how this  
**[0:46:07-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:07):**  community of microbes impact.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:09):**  Because again, it's not about the microbes.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:11):**  It's about what is happening in the field and we use the community of microbes as a  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:16):**  buy indicator.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:18):**  So if we want to really understand soil health, we have to measure the life in the soil.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:26):**  And the life in the soil are the microbes.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:31):**  And that's a nice bridge to a question I always like to ask, definitely inspired by John Kempf,  
**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:35):**  but where are you contrarian?  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:37):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture and maybe agriculture as a whole  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:41):**  where others don't agree with you?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:44):**  Like where are you different?  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:45):**  We've heard a few things, but what would be the central piece if you, I mean, like now,  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:49):**  like when I'm asking that question?  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:52):**  So I already mentioned that many people who consider regenerative agriculture and small  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:46:57):**  thing and let's say site, what I think should not happen is that we consider regenerative  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:04):**  agriculture as another group of farmers.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:06):**  So conventional, organic and regenerative, no, something like that.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:10):**  No, actually this is bigger.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:12):**  And they're data geeks and that's what I realize.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:16):**  And they're really big farms.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:18):**  Which is great for you.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah, actually, exactly.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:21):**  And they're helping us to really understand because they give us feedback.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:24):**  They give us a shared data as well because they want to know they're really eager and  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:29):**  they use a lot of rationality behind any experiment they do.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:33):**  So it's not random that I am going to put some cover crop or I'm not going to till.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:39):**  No, they actually do something in a certain direction.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:42):**  They consider it's going to be positive for their activity, their disability, their financials  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:48):**  and then they test it.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:49):**  And if that works, they keep doing it and then they share it.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:52):**  That's also, it's an open community.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:54):**  And many corporations are also looking at this.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:47:57):**  So I say this is not something small.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:00):**  It's something growing and this is not random.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:05):**  It's really data-oriented practices and a crowd knowledge that we are sharing.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:11):**  So I love that.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:12):**  And I think this is a great starting point to change or to evolve, let me say to evolve  
**[0:48:17-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:17):**  the way we are farming today.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:19):**  And how important is that openness and let's say the open data movement for this movement?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:24):**  I mean, you mentioned it's very important, but for a company like yours in soil sampling,  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:29):**  does it play a role at all?  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:30):**  We just recorded and hopefully it will be online before here or otherwise it will be  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:34):**  just after on open data in satellite imagery and a lot of soil.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:39):**  And there it seems to be very fundamental because a lot of this data comes from public  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:43):**  entities like NASA, like ESA, and we all paid for that.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:46):**  So it's very nice to be able to actually use that and to keep it open.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:49):**  How important is that?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:50):**  Does it play a role at all in the soil side of things, like the soil sampling side, or  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:54):**  do you see it potentially playing a role in the future?  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:48:57):**  As you see that these growers are sharing and they will benefit if others are sharing.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:00):**  And if everybody shares, then like the tools get better.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:03):**  Yeah, we have to share knowledge and everything we learn from the soil has to be shared.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:09):**  For others to learn.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:11):**  And what we have as a company, for sure we have our IP, which is how we understand or  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:15):**  what is the logic to really develop certain results.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:20):**  And beyond data privacy and confidentiality, there are certain dimensions that you can  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:27):**  open or disclosure.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:28):**  So what is, if you think crop by crop or region by region, there are certain incidences  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:33):**  that is going to help all the farmers to do better.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:36):**  So yeah, opening data and working with researchers really think that is key.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:41):**  And that's what helps humans to go ahead and be sure that we have something to share in  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:46):**  the future.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:47):**  And something to eat.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:48):**  Or to enjoy.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:49):**  And also to eat.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:51):**  If there would be one thing, like you have a magic wand, what would you change overnight?  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:56):**  Could be anything.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:49:57):**  It could be global consciousness, could be solar, I mean, it doesn't have to be in food  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:01):**  and ag and doesn't have to be in soil sampling.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:03):**  But if you had the magic power to change one thing overnight, what would you change tomorrow  
**[0:50:07-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:07):**  morning?  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:08):**  Wow.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:09):**  Unlimited power, but only one.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:12):**  Only one, only one.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:14):**  Well, mindsets, I will put everybody in collaborative mode.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:19):**  We know that we want to enjoy our own life in the way we really think is the right way  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:24):**  to enjoy our time.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:25):**  But the collaborate is important.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:28):**  Positive thinking in that way.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:29):**  So it wouldn't be something material.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:31):**  It would be more like a less team up and have a common goal.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:36):**  And there are people with this mindset, but I think we need more.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:40):**  Completely agree.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:41):**  And switching to maybe less collaborative as well.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:45):**  Like what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund?  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:49):**  Could be, let's say, a billion dollars or billion euros.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:52):**  And you definitely have to have to put it to work as an investment.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:55):**  But it could be a very long term one.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:57):**  Could be bringing back the desert in Peru if you wanted to.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:50:59):**  And I'm not asking this as a question to understand exactly to the euro what you're going to invest  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:03):**  in, but I'm interested in your priorities.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:05):**  Like what would you prioritize if you would no longer be running a Biomakers, but you  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:09):**  would be running this investment fund full time?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:12):**  I'm imagining you would look at agriculture, but it could also be something else.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:15):**  What would you, how would you put it to work and what would you be the main sectors in  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:20):**  terms of priority?  
**[0:51:22-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:22):**  That's also interesting.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:23):**  Well, thinking about the, imagine I've been thinking about agriculture mainly for the  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:29):**  last 10 years and I really focus on this.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:33):**  So everything I'm reading about is either how to grow the startup, how to scale up or  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:40):**  how to have a deeper impact.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:42):**  But there is no magic formula.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:44):**  I mean, looking at what people with a lot of money is doing, I will try to not control,  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:50):**  but push and update the productive means, especially the soil.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:51:56):**  I would say I will buy land to care for the land, to avoid land destruction, to plant  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:03):**  more forests.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:04):**  That's another thing.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:06):**  I think we need more forests for sure and we need more arable land.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:11):**  And if I'll have that amount of money, probably I'll try to do that impact.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:16):**  But many people with billionaires, with billions are already doing that kind of strategy.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:22):**  And that's on the agricultural side.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:24):**  And I think with that will be enough for one billion.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:29):**  And where would you do it?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:30):**  Like, would you choose because you're saying many already doing it.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:33):**  And if you look at like places where that building could make a huge difference, would  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:39):**  that be like on the edge of where the desert is coming in or where land is there certifying?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:44):**  Would you do some edgy things in terms of, I don't know, syntropic agroforestry?  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:47):**  How would you make sure it has that impact you want to see compared to somebody that  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:52):**  maybe has 100 billion and is buying up half of Texas or something like that?  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:55):**  How would you make sure it's edgy and interesting and not boring?  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:52:58):**  Because that's how we sort of started this conversation.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:00):**  Really standard investment strategy diversity.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:03):**  So I will do a piece of not very innovative or risk taken.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:08):**  I will for sure prevent the certification of certain areas, as you mentioned, climate  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:15):**  change is moving ahead and impacting.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:18):**  And we see this also in Spain.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:20):**  Yeah, we see this winter.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:23):**  There is certain parts of the world where rain is really making problems.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:28):**  While, for instance, you mentioned Spain, this has been extremely dry winter.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:34):**  So I don't know how spring is going to be, but this is going to have an impact for sure  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:37):**  on the performance of agriculture.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:40):**  So probably trying to preserve and boost or, let's say, adapt the land into these new conditions,  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:48):**  that will be something that will be very rewarding for me.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:53):**  On the return point of view that, well, I'm a bachelor in economic science, so I always  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:57):**  have to think about the profitability.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:53:59):**  I don't think it's the most profitable one.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:02):**  There is a lot of markets that have a volatility, but no, I really will do that.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:07):**  If I will have one billion, I will really commit to some kind of impact strategy on  
**[0:54:12-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:12):**  sustainability, land, agriculture, nature, these kind of things.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:17):**  I think we need that.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:19):**  Super.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:20):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:21):**  And thank you so much for your time and sharing, first of all, your journey, because it's been  
**[0:54:24-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:24):**  a journey the last seven years or eight years now.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:28):**  And also the progress and what we need in the magic world, but also the science-driven  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:33):**  world of soil testing and soil and microbes and the microbial communities.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:38):**  Perfect.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:39):**  And pleasure being here.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:41):**  And anytime you need any insight about what is happening in the soil, happy to share it  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:44):**  with all of you.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:45):**  Perfect.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:46):**  I will definitely put the details below in the show notes if you want to get in touch  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:50):**  with you and if you want to get your soil tested.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:54:53):**  Perfect.

**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:04):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:09):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.

**[0:57:30-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:30):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:32):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:37):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:42):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:57:47-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:47):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:48):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:57:53):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:58:02-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:02):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:03):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:05):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:07):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:11):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:13):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/adrian-ferrero#t=0:58:18):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

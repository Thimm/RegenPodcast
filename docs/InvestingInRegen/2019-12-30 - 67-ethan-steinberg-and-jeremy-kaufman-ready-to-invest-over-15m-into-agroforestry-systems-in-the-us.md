**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:00:47):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:00:49):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:31):**  Today I have Ethan and Jeremy of Propagate Ventures back for a check-in interview to  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:35):**  see where they're at since February 18 when we recorded our last podcast.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:40):**  So welcome back Ethan and Jeremy.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:41):**  How's it going?  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:42):**  It's good to get a chance to catch up.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:45):**  I'm extremely well and I'm looking forward to a long discussion.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:49):**  Last time we clocked in I think one of the records of the podcast to discuss trees, farms,  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:54):**  agroforestry, retail investments and obviously chestnuts.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:01:57):**  But let's start with where Propagate Ventures is right now.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:01):**  We're talking November 2019 compared to February 2018 which is more than a year and a half  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:07):**  ago.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:09):**  In the world of a startup it feels like a lifetime which is all good and positive things.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:13):**  Over the course of the last roughly year and a half we've really focused on growing the  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:19):**  business and I think you've probably seen some of that growth in the industry as well  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:25):**  in terms of some maturity happening.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:28):**  So with Propagate we have expanded our operations.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:34):**  So we're now operating in about six states in the US.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:38):**  We are working on over 6,000 acres.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:42):**  Now this is all the East Coast.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:44):**  This is where the average size of the farm is a little bit smaller than what you see  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:48):**  on the West.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:52):**  In the past year we've focused on really moving projects through to the point where we're  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:02:59):**  planting trees.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:01):**  What that looks like is we have the numbers behind that look like about 90,000, 90,000  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:09):**  trees that will be planted over the course of the next three years.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:15):**  And that's just a little bit of the movement that we've been able to drive forward in agroforestry  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:21):**  systems over the course of the last year and a half.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:25):**  And then as a business we've also had a few other things go on which is we've joined the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:31):**  Techstars Sustainability Cohort, their 2019 class which just finished up about two weeks  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:40):**  ago and then we also are part of Elemental Accelerators portfolio as well.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:46):**  So it's been a fun and active time for the business both on the opportunities for us  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:52):**  to work on the business to see it grow and then to work in the business where we get  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:03:57):**  to actually drive agroforestry projects and put those trees in the ground, certainly having  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:02):**  some of those chestnuts ready to be planted.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:05):**  Sounds very good.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:06):**  And I think the sector has been exploding or at least the discussion on trees and planting  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:12):**  trees and planting trees on farms and productive trees has just been a whole different level  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:17):**  I think than when you started.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:19):**  In terms of vision and practicality around Propagate Ventures, is that still the same?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:26):**  And for the people who didn't listen to the previous interview I definitely recommend  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:29):**  it.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:30):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:31):**  But can you give a short overview of Propagate Ventures right now and then we can dive a  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:36):**  bit into if that's very different from Propagate in 2018?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:41):**  I think overall the visions remain the same.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:43):**  We stayed very focused and our team is extraordinarily passionate about what we're doing.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:50):**  I think some of the nuances of how we approach that and what that iteration of the business  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:57):**  looks like.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:04:58):**  So today as we've moved forward since our last discussion, Propagate's focused on making  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:04):**  it easy for investors to fund low risk agroforestry projects.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:11):**  Now we have analytics and project development tools that make that possible.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:18):**  And the goal really is designed around helping farmers increase their profitability with  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:23):**  agroforestry as the mechanism to do so.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:28):**  That platform of analytics and product development tools is really meant to simplify some of  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:34):**  the operational know-how, workflow tools, and then investments that farmers need to  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:41):**  integrate fruit, nut, and timber trees with agriculture in row with their existing operations.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:48):**  So again, really designing for agroforestry.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:52):**  What makes it interesting and fun for us as we think about this vision of where the investment  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:05:56):**  opportunities sit in the regenerative agriculture industry is a lot of that work that we do  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:04):**  on the analytics and project development side are meant to also serve as a sort of underwriting  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:11):**  process for due diligence to help quantify the risk and identify where the investment  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:17):**  potential sits to make investments in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:23):**  Now Propagate at the moment, we're very focused on the United States.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:28):**  We're working in our own backyard.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:30):**  We grew up here, so we're focused here.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:32):**  But there's certainly a mentality in thinking that where we build tools and create some  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:38):**  capacity in the United States, that there's opportunities internationally to provide resources  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:45):**  and create tools that support farmers in those places and really meets their holistic context  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:52):**  on the ground, on those farms, in places that may not be the Propagate team's backyard.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:06:58):**  So am I hearing correctly you're thinking about licensing or somehow making your technology,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:07):**  your software and your systems available for other groups that are not you basically outside  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:13):**  the US?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:14):**  I think at some point in the future, potentially, I think the goal today is to really have a  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:23):**  strong footing on what we do here in the United States and then be able to understand the  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:30):**  context of what's going on elsewhere in the world.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:34):**  Agriculture of course has applications in many different climate types in many different  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:39):**  countries and many different places all over the world.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:42):**  And then the socio-cultural context that's associated with it is really important, particularly  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:48):**  as we talk about trees as assets that are long term and are providing sustenance and  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:07:56):**  economic value over time that they really need to match what goes on.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:00):**  So it's certainly something we think about and it's definitely a fun exercise that we  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:07):**  get to vision how the company grows and how we scale agroforestry as a really strategic  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:15):**  solution both on the profitability front for farmers across the United States and across  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:23):**  the world as well as as it relates to climate change and how agroforestry can work to create  
**[0:08:31-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:31):**  profitable options for sequestering carbon, for mitigating nutrient runoff, for filtering  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:39):**  water, etc.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:42):**  And I'm imagining that dreaming or visioning, I wouldn't call it dreaming, actually visioning  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:47):**  of where the company could go is also something you were forced to do probably happily at  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:54):**  Techstars.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:55):**  Can you explain a bit what that experience was?  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:08:58):**  How did it come about for people that don't know what Techstars actually is and basically  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:02):**  your cohort of sustainable focused companies?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:06):**  What was that experience like?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah, overall just a great time.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:14):**  The folks behind Techstars as well as the Nature Conservancy.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:18):**  The Nature Conservancy and Techstars created a partnership to help support and build companies  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:26):**  in the startups in the climate space that are providing solutions both around technology  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:33):**  and elsewise to solve the climate crisis.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:38):**  And so the teams behind the program, both on Techstars and the Nature Conservancy, really  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:45):**  passionate and really driven and really, really intelligent.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:49):**  It was such a pleasure for us to get to spend the time to work with them.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:09:54):**  And that's always an evolving process, so we'll continue to work with them.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:00):**  The game plan for that program and our involvement specifically was really looking at how we  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:07):**  can increase the velocity of our business.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:12):**  Being a startup and being about two years into the game with our company, really looking  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:19):**  forward to the next two or three years and beyond.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:23):**  And how do we increase the speed and capacity at which we make decisions and at which we  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:30):**  build our product to really have a velocity that solves very direct needs that sit within  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:37):**  the industry.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:38):**  So one of those key things that we've been focused on as a business is the sort of problem  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:43):**  of what's keeping investors from feeling really comfortable to invest in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:51):**  So to boil that down a little bit, where is there risk?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:55):**  And in project finance, there's risk across a series of different angles.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:10:59):**  We've seen a lot of this in solar.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:00):**  I believe we may have mentioned this at some point in our last discussion, but that really  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:06):**  sits around technology.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah, we did.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:08):**  We were discussing PPAs and Wonder, the crowdfunding platform, crowd lending platform.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:15):**  We definitely touched upon what we, I think, and I'm pretty sure you're still on that camp,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:20):**  we can learn from the renewable energy space and how far, in a very different sector obviously  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:25):**  with different variables, et cetera, but how far they've brought the impact investing space  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:31):**  or the investing space along and how easy it now is for, still you need significant  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:36):**  capital, usually more than a thousand dollars or euros, but actually the minimum came down  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:41):**  a lot and the potential of this sector to grow is just immense.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:45):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:46):**  And I think we're seeing that today with regenerative agriculture, slowly, but it's certainly happening.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:52):**  And so to relate it to Techstars, I'm glad you brought up Wonder.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:11:59):**  Brian Bursik, who's the founder and CEO of Wonder, was one of our mentors that we spent  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:04):**  a chunk of time with during Techstars.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:08):**  So Techstars is a very mentor driven accelerator program.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:12):**  So we sat down with, we had five lead mentors who are high capacity, very strategic and  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:22):**  intelligent people.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:23):**  And the fact that they gave us their time of day to sit down with us and really plug  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:27):**  into the issues and challenges of our business was outstanding.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:32):**  Brian being one of those folks to really get an understanding of what were some of the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:35):**  challenges he faced in the early days of their business with Wonder and what are some of  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:40):**  the parallels he sees with our business and his business and how we might think about  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:46):**  collaborating and being strategic around solving some of those issues so that we can drive  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:51):**  the process forward similar to, as you were saying, about moving regenerative agriculture  
**[0:12:58-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:12:58):**  forward quickly to meet the scope of the problem similar to what took the solar industry 10  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:07):**  to 15 years to handle.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:10):**  And a lot of those components were around the risk in technology, risk in operations  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:16):**  and maintenance of these systems, risk in the offtake, so back to those purchase agreements,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:24):**  and then risk in the supply.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:25):**  Which sounds extremely similar to trees.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:32):**  So for that component, that's really what we've spent our time as a business really  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:38):**  thinking about how can we solve those challenges to make it really easy for investors to unlock  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:45):**  these massive markets, which is exactly what Wonder did for the solar industry and there's  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:51):**  other companies that have done similar work.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:13:54):**  AngelList is one of them that did something similar for the startup in space.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:01):**  So we're really thinking about how we can build a product and solution that drives that  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:06):**  process forward.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:07):**  And I know Jeremy spent the majority of his time among many, many other things, but to  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:16):**  really think about what the roadmap looks like for that product and the vision for making  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:21):**  the investments in agroforestry a clean and clear process.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:26):**  Jeremy, you want to lead us a bit through the roadmap and also what you learned or saw  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:32):**  in Techstars and working with these amazing mentors of that roadmap of, okay, how do we  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:40):**  first of all speed it up because we don't have 15 years and we need a lot of those trees  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:44):**  in the ground as soon as possible, but it's much easier said than done obviously from  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:48):**  behind a computer with a microphone.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:50):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:53):**  It's a really tough problem to solve because you had to solve a lot of them all at the  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:57):**  same time.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:14:58):**  So the challenge is looking at it from almost as a scalable technology problem as much as  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:06):**  a kind of project by project problem.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:08):**  You can take the approach from the ground up as well as from the top down and kind of  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:13):**  see where they meet.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:14):**  And luckily on our end, we have an amazing group of customers as well as an amazing group  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:21):**  of potential customers that we've been working with for a long time.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:25):**  And when you say customers, do you mean farmers or investors?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:29):**  We mean farmers as well as investors who have invested in farms through us.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:34):**  So it's kind of a combination of both.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:38):**  And those two groups have very different information requirements as well as very different knowledge  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:45):**  gaps that need to be built to help them kind of bridge their understanding and comfort  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:50):**  at different states of the projects development.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:15:54):**  And so really what we've built is a way of both tracking progress of the project as well  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:03):**  as building kind of a 20 year long outlook for what to expect through the lifetime of  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:09):**  that project from the perspective of both the manager and the operations manager as  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:15):**  well as the perspective of the investor.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:18):**  And those meet in our platform to enable them to actually take action.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:23):**  So everything down to kind of the task level of what the farm needs to do throughout a  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:29):**  season to meet the benchmarks for actual expectations from an investment perspective, as well as  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:35):**  from an investor's perspective to track kind of where those benchmarks are being hit or  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:39):**  where we might be able to predict things being missed and how we can make viable adjustments  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:44):**  throughout the seasons to be able to actually succeed against what we're projecting.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:49):**  So yeah, I mean, I guess I can leave it there in terms of kind of the high level of what  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:54):**  the problem we're trying to solve is from both of those customers' perspectives.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:16:58):**  But in terms of Techstars, really what they've helped us do is kind of view our business  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:03):**  in two life cycles, which is we have kind of the fast growing, being able to scale across  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:10):**  a lot of project life cycle where we are able to iterate much faster on the technology side  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:15):**  of things, while on the kind of the project level kind of growth cycle, it's a little  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:22):**  bit more slow and we have to be very diligent around decisions that are being made.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:28):**  This is agriculture, right?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:29):**  So things move fairly slowly and yet they take it year by year to kind of make the adjustments.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:38):**  And so for us, being able to kind of build internally the tools that we've needed to  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:44):**  be able to kind of switch between that faster cycle, as well as the slower cycle of looking  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:50):**  at agricultural, agricultural cyclical nature, is something that we've institutionalized  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:54):**  throughout that program and that Techstars really helped us with.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:17:57):**  I would love to go a bit more into detail on the following of the project.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:01):**  I mean, I can understand if we're talking about a solar project, there are services  
**[0:18:05-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:05):**  that can adjust or can have a look at how my solar park on the roof, etc. is doing or  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:14):**  there's maintenance involved, etc.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:16):**  In terms of agroforestry, trees on, let's say, my land as a farmer, how do you track  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:22):**  the progress?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:23):**  How do you make sure the trees are doing fine?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:27):**  How do you make sure you can feed back this information to investors?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:32):**  How does that process at the moment work?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:34):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:36):**  So I'll kind of maybe to help answer the question, let me walk through how we go about all this.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:43):**  What's the process that takes place that enables agroforestry to be a low-risk project finance  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:53):**  opportunity?  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:18:54):**  And so the way we go about it, it's sort of the, it's kind of like the business stuff,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:00):**  if you will, of the product.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:02):**  So essentially, it starts with de-risking the projects.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:06):**  So we make it really easy to access project development tools and economic insights that  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:12):**  farmers need to confidently manage an agroforestry project.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:17):**  On our side of things, we analyze everything.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:21):**  So we look at costs and revenues.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:24):**  We look at yield projections, as well as labor assumptions and other components like market  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:33):**  conditions.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:35):**  And what this allows us to do is it takes, it's a software approach to project diligence,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:40):**  which allows Propagate to assess these projects faster and more accurately than some of the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:45):**  other opportunities or folks in the business today.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:52):**  And this is really around driving the process forward really efficiently so that investors  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:57):**  feel comfortable.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:19:59):**  And more importantly, the farmers who are essentially the managers of these investments  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:04):**  feel very confident that what they're doing in terms of their day-to-day operation is  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:10):**  going to be successful.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:12):**  And so as we analyze these projects, we take the best of them.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:16):**  We then group them into funds and we diversify across crop types and geographies.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:22):**  And how do these projects and slash farmers come to you?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:26):**  Is that you going out to find them or is it farmers signing up and reaching out like,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:32):**  hey, I would love to integrate trees into my operation.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:35):**  Can you help me?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:37):**  So right now, a lot of the farms that have come into kind of our universe have been mostly  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:45):**  cold inbound.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:47):**  About 50% of the farms that we work with have found us through Facebook, through just searching  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:53):**  online, believe it or not.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:20:55):**  And the other half, a lot of that comes from conferences and strategic partners that make  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:00):**  introductions.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:02):**  And in terms of process, these are most of the folks that come to us are interested in  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:08):**  silvopasture.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:09):**  They're interested in integrating trees into their operation, but they really don't know  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:13):**  where to start.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:14):**  And they're looking for a strategic partner to help them kind of guide that process forward  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:18):**  because it's a long-term process and they're looking for someone who can help them de-risk  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:23):**  it, help them bridge their knowledge gaps on how to manage these systems.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:31):**  It's both a high need for them to have someone like us involved, but also the value that  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:36):**  we provide is exactly what they're looking for.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:39):**  So it's a really good fit at this stage for most of the farms that are interested in agroforestry.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:45):**  And then, Ethan, you were mentioning you basically bundle them together and that's a step as  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:51):**  well in de-risking as you have different crops, different land types, different farms, meaning  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:21:56):**  that hopefully a higher amount of trees obviously survives and creates the yield you need.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:01):**  How many should I imagine, what's the current size of a fund?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:06):**  Because a fund could be 5 million or 500.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:08):**  What is your sweet spot at the moment?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:10):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:12):**  So we're in the midst of bundling a lot of these projects together.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:17):**  I think as Jeremy mentioned, as we get more of these project opportunities, these farmers  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:24):**  that we're working with through the process, through that analysis phase, we really have  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:29):**  a better understanding of what is needed to make these projects successful.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:36):**  What is the project size that I have to imagine?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:38):**  Is it 50,000 or 500,000 or 5 million?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:43):**  I mean, it depends obviously, but what's the ones you're working with now more or less  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:47):**  when you say a project?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:49):**  Right now it ranges between about 200,000 to a million is the size of the projects.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:22:56):**  And those are just based on crop selection as well as size of farm.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:00):**  Fruit is more capital intensive comparatively to timber.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:04):**  So it's a distribution across that dollar amount depending on the crops that are selected  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:08):**  for the farm as well as the size of the farm.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:11):**  To follow up on that, one of the areas we're going as we move forward is we think about  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:18):**  crop types, so like a shrub fruit or a tree fruit, a tree nut, and then timber that to  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:25):**  have a diversity of those various crop types also gives us some flexibility in terms of  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:33):**  what sits in to one of those funds.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:39):**  It reduces the risk around the expectations of what we'll get from an economic perspective  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:46):**  when we have something like a shrub fruit, like a blueberry for example, which performs  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:51):**  very differently.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:52):**  So it has different capex requirements, it has different apex requirements, and also  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:23:57):**  has a different return profile than something like timber or something like a chestnut.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:02):**  So as we start to blend those together, it really creates a very nice balance of a portfolio  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:08):**  that provides what we believe is a really attractive opportunity from an investment  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:13):**  perspective into agriculture and really looking at the productive assets on farmland that  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:20):**  are driving the value across the farm.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:23):**  And when you say blend, does that mean blend on a portfolio level or sort of on a farm  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:28):**  level?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:30):**  It's both farm level and portfolio level.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:33):**  So different farms, there's opportunities to do multiple crop types if the size is right  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:38):**  and the farmer has the right operations and management team in place to actually manage  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:42):**  it.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:43):**  So sometimes it does go down to the farm level where you're diversifying on the same piece  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:46):**  of ground as well.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:47):**  Which could be very interesting from a risk perspective, cash flow on a farm farm level  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:53):**  obviously and a soil perspective.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:56):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:24:57):**  A good example of this is a black currant or elderberry and chestnut polyculture planting  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:06):**  where the black currant is machine harvested and the chestnut is also machine harvested,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:12):**  ones harvested early in June, July, ones harvested in October.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:18):**  So you're going to have that staging of cash flows as well through the year for that single  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:23):**  project.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:24):**  And I can imagine they are, let's say productive, not at the same moment.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:29):**  It takes X years for the chestnut and X years for the black currant.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, that's absolutely right.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:35):**  The easy principle to think about here is that as you move towards shrub fruit, the  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:40):**  amount of time it takes to yield is shorter, the potential return is also higher, but it  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:48):**  has a lot more operations and management risk just because it's more intensive, more horticulturally  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:52):**  intensive.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:53):**  Tree fruit similarly, tree nuts are kind of in the middle there.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:25:56):**  And then as you move toward timber, it's a lot lower operations and management risk,  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:00):**  but relative returns are also lower and it's more of a lump sum type cash flow comparatively  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:05):**  to an annual based operating income cash flow.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:09):**  And do you see opportunities there as there's a lot of discussion, at least I see a bit  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:13):**  from the outside of the agroforestry space in terms of complex systems and not having  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:20):**  just timber or, I mean, you're saying in terms of management, obviously there's a whole different  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:24):**  level needed if you're doing fruit trees, for example, as you mentioned.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:29):**  Do you see developments there, interest from investors, interest from farmers to make these  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:34):**  systems more complex and thus, let's say more interesting in terms of a soil, from a soil  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:38):**  perspective or in terms from a carbon perspective?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:43):**  So, you know, everything we do is really from the project level up from the analysis perspective.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:49):**  So when we're running through an analysis, we're looking at the context of the people  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:53):**  on the ground and their capacities to manage complexity.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:26:56):**  And there's always a desire to increase complexity from a biological diversity perspective, but  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:04):**  from a economics perspective, there's kind of a tension there.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:08):**  So what we look to do is integrate as much diversity, especially in the areas that are  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:13):**  going to generally be underproductive.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:16):**  These are like very wet areas on the farm or areas that would be better served as being  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:20):**  a buffer zone.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:21):**  So about 10%, maybe sometimes between 5 and 15% of the planting typically goes into what  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:28):**  we call biodiversity species, which are things that might have marketable yields, but are  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:35):**  fairly niche at this stage.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:38):**  But from an ecological perspective, provide native pollinator habitat, as well as predatory  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:44):**  insects to provide the kind of ecological pest management infrastructure on a farm that  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:51):**  would otherwise not be there.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:53):**  So we're planning in those biodiversity kind of complexity pieces to it, but is weighted  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:27:59):**  depending on the capacity of the farm to be able to manage that much complexity.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:04):**  Planting biomass in general is very labor intensive and takes a lot of diligence.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:08):**  And so we just want to make sure everyone's prepared to do that when we plant it.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:13):**  And I'll kind of pick up on that as the decision gets made to move forward and to integrate  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:20):**  more biodiverse complexity, if you will, into these farm operations where propagate sits  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:27):**  and where we're really trying to continue to make this process really clean and easy  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:32):**  for both farmers and investors.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:34):**  So to go back to projects have gone through, have been put into a fund.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:41):**  And then the next component is once an investor participates, then we're really focused on  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:47):**  brokering the trees that are needed for our farmers so that that farm can meet the investment  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:53):**  expectations and the operations and maintenance component that Jeremy's pointing to.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:28:59):**  So we have essentially a group of vetted farm partners.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:02):**  These are some of the folks that work hard on a day to day basis and fully understand  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:08):**  regenerative systems, as well as understand the depths of what it means to be farming  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:15):**  and are very knowledgeable and smart people around how to manage their operation.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:20):**  So we're working with this group of folks to ensure that maintenance is really top of  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:24):**  the class and where we go from there in terms of propagate's involvement is to start to  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:31):**  build contracts with commercial buyers for the harvested produce and timber so that we  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:38):**  can generate profit shares for our farmers so they have access to the economic upside  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:45):**  of what they're managing on a day to day.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:48):**  And a lot of this is to take some of the risk off the table of answering the question of  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:53):**  from a farmer's perspective, I'm interested in diversifying my system.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:29:58):**  I'm happy to plant tree fruit.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:01):**  Who's going to buy those crops?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:04):**  So starting to bring in those components earlier, which is some of the pre-purchase agreements  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:10):**  and some of those components to continue to drive that process forward.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:14):**  And as we look at the harvested produce and timber that are coming out of a diversified  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:19):**  portfolio of projects, it gives us a little bit more wiggle room and capacity to have  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:25):**  strong relationships on the commercial side.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:29):**  And if you think about a biodiversity species like a shrub willow, which is really good  
**[0:30:34-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:34):**  in riparian zone areas or wet areas, from a marketing perspective, it's a fairly difficult  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:41):**  to market niche crop that you would sell into flower shops.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:47):**  But if there was, say, a florist that was working for a large company that wanted to  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:52):**  procure really high quality willow stems for their ornamental arrangements, that's something  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:30:58):**  that we would love to be able to broker.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:00):**  I think the tough part is at this stage, those types of crops are still very niche.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:04):**  So we want to make sure that when we're planting those in, we're planting them in with the  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:08):**  idea that they might not make money.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:10):**  So they're a very small percentage of allocation, but still providing the ecological benefits  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:14):**  on the farm side of things.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:16):**  And what would have to change if you look from an agroforestry perspective and a scale  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:22):**  up?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:23):**  What would have to change to really make this scalable?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:26):**  Is it more attention for these niche products that have a huge biodiversity component?  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:32):**  Is it us eating a lot more chestnuts?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:34):**  What would be, I mean, you can probably answer both of you in a different way.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:39):**  What would be, according to you, the biggest potential breakthrough over the next years  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:43):**  that would really scale agroforestry?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:46):**  I think it's definitely everybody eating more chestnuts.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:50):**  Yeah, there are a lot of barriers to entry in terms of the scale up.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:31:57):**  So there's a lot of work happening on the research and development front to make sure  
**[0:32:03-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:03):**  that the genetic development of some of these tree crops is moving forward in a way that  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:11):**  allows farmers to better utilize those crops in an economically viable way compared to  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:17):**  certain grains or cereals that are used today.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:21):**  I think in terms of the scale up thing, we're sitting in a bit of an interesting phase where  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:26):**  the R&D work is fairly strong and has happened over the course of time.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:32):**  And so there's not much concern there.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:35):**  There's always work to be done.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:36):**  But the next piece is really driving capital into more projects.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:41):**  So this is moving beyond the sort of pilot phase.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:44):**  I think there's a series of agroforestry projects across the world that can offer insight into  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:52):**  how these projects operate, what they look like, what the management and the operation  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:32:56):**  is that we can really build off of that and use that information and context to our advantage  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:03):**  to continue to steward capital into more projects and create opportunities for young farmers  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:09):**  to be active in this space.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:11):**  And I think we're starting to see some of that.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:13):**  Certainly some of the foundations and family offices are getting involved.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:18):**  And I think we're now moving more into the realm where the average investor is turning  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:24):**  their head and thinking, hmm, maybe there is a really interesting opportunity in agriculture  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:30):**  that they may have ignored five years ago.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:34):**  So I think that's where we are and where some of the pressures are in terms of what's happening  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:39):**  from a climate perspective.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:41):**  I'll leave it there.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:42):**  And Jeremy, I'm sure you have another approach to answering that question.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:47):**  Sure.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:49):**  I mean, I'm happy to kind of add some color to that.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:51):**  I mean, I think the key thing here is if you take the long view, if you take the 50-year  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:33:56):**  view and just look back in history, permanent crop productions of fruit and nut crops, as  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:02):**  well as timber crops, have historically outperformed other asset classes.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:09):**  And so the case for the types of crops that enable agroforestry to happen is actually  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:18):**  really well spelled out.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:20):**  Doesn't it panic people that, I mean, there was in a time with not extremely rapid climate  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:25):**  change or climate disruption, climate panic, and trees don't move in the sense that they  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:31):**  kind of walk away?  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:32):**  And especially as investors, if I say I'm going to take a 50-year view and having part  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:36):**  of my assets being ground bound, is it something that scares investors to put money to work  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:43):**  on agroforestry systems?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:45):**  I would say probably.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:48):**  I think natural capital solutions in general are things that in a time of climate change,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:54):**  there is this climate risk factor.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:34:58):**  But if you look at that risk factor and you actually say, ask yourself the question, if  
**[0:35:05-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:05):**  I had an option on these solutions for having some sort of benefit come back to me.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:13):**  So if you take a 50-year outlook and you say, I have a carbon option on these trees, and  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:19):**  they might return 10 percent to me over that 20 years just in terms of nut production or  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:23):**  timber production, having that option is also very attractive.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:27):**  That's helping mitigate that climate risk piece.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:29):**  And so I think the world is going down a direction where having the option to actually capitalize  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:37):**  on that risk factor is something that is going to be increasingly attractive to investors,  
**[0:35:43-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:43):**  even if it means you say increase some loss to a degree in the tree itself.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:52):**  A good example of this might be something along the lines of if you look across the  
**[0:35:59-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:35:59):**  entire sector of agriculture in terms of risk factors of a given species, trees as a species  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:08):**  in landscapes are relatively low risk from a production perspective comparatively to  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:13):**  other crop types.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:15):**  See, if you have three years of pretty bad drought in the Northeast and you lose a good  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:24):**  corn yield, you're going to be operating at a loss for all three of those years.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:28):**  But in that same kind of climate zone, you still might be able to get a good yield out  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:33):**  of a permanent crop because they're more drought tolerant.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:37):**  I'm not talking about the Central Valley of California here.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:40):**  That's a different scenario.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:42):**  But from an ecological perspective, trees have some more resilience factors than many  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:49):**  other crop types do within agriculture.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:51):**  And so I think you have to both compare it to the existing asset classes that are natural  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:36:57):**  climate solutions, asset classes that we have today in and around agriculture, as well as  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:02):**  look at the options that might be on the table down the line.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:06):**  No, I think it's a great answer.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:08):**  And I want to be conscious of both of your time and end with a final question to both  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:12):**  of you, which I think is a question I started asking after I interviewed you.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:17):**  So not so long ago, but it is a question I like to ask to see unrelated in this case  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:22):**  to propagate.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:23):**  If you could use a magic wand and change something overnight and tomorrow morning we wake up  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:27):**  and Jeremy or Ethan has changed something in the agriculture and let's say also the  
**[0:37:32-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:32):**  forestry space, what would that be?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:35):**  That is a phenomenal question.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:37):**  Wow.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:38):**  I have to put my thinking cap on for that one.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:42):**  My initial reaction and how I want to respond to that question is what I'd like to see is  
**[0:37:51-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:51):**  fairly simple, is that the average person just has a much clearer, much more clear connection  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:37:59):**  to where their food comes from.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:00):**  If I think about my family and my close friends, I'm sort of in a lucky space where they've  
**[0:38:08-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:08):**  heard me talk about this so much that they've changed their purchasing habits, which makes  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:15):**  dinner conversation certainly more interesting, but the food also tastes better.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:19):**  I bet.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:20):**  It's these little changes of am I buying a pound of beef at the grocery store because  
**[0:38:26-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:26):**  it's the cheapest option available or am I buying a pound of beef that comes from a ranch  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:34):**  that is running holistic plant grazing?  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:38):**  The latter option both taste better.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:40):**  Sure, maybe it's a little bit more expensive today, but I think that will change as supply  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:44):**  goes up.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:46):**  My answer to the question is a sort of demand thing.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:48):**  The one thing I would like to see to support farmers and to support ecological solutions  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:38:55):**  in the regenerative agriculture and then move that into the commodities space is a slight  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:02):**  change in purchasing habits, a little bit more care and passion for the type of food  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:07):**  we're buying and where it comes from and really getting an understanding of who are the people  
**[0:39:13-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:13):**  behind the farms that are making that food available to us, which is a little bit of  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:20):**  a mental cultural shift, I think.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:23):**  Great answer.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:24):**  I'm going to go down a little bit of a different route, which is I think that right now we  
**[0:39:34-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:34):**  kind of have a market where we're not pricing in risk appropriately from a macro perspective.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:43):**  If you look at kind of the way in which agricultural landscapes are financed, you look at the way  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:47):**  in which they're valued.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:51):**  There's generally a disconnect between the agricultural value of what can be produced  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:39:56):**  on a piece of land, how it's been treated for 40 years and the actual price of that  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:02):**  landscape itself.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:03):**  I think we're going to actually see this renaissance happen where the risk factors  
**[0:40:13-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:13):**  that come as a part of certain practices in agriculture or certain practices within a  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:21):**  watershed that increase the risk of that watershed are accurately reflected in the pricing,  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:25):**  as well as the productivity of that landscape historically actually starts to get factored  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:31):**  into that pricing.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:32):**  That way, we start to get a little bit more of an accurate price discovery within agriculture  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:40):**  where we can actually see where the value is in a more transparent fashion.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:43):**  I think right now it's a little bit more difficult, given the history of the last 40 to 50 years,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:50):**  that has moved agricultural land values in a direction that are disconnected from the  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:55):**  underlying fundamentals.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:40:56):**  I think getting back to that is going to be a big change for moving agriculture in a direction  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:03):**  that will help regenerate landscapes.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:05):**  It's going to be an enormous change to get some air out of that bubble and connect it  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:11):**  back to actually what a landscape or a farm can produce.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:16):**  Then the whole discussion obviously becomes how to regenerate it or how to improve that  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:20):**  asset, improve the soil, improve the landscape so it can actually produce more, which is  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:24):**  now completely disconnected from the land price.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:27):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/ethan-steinberg-and-jeremy-kaufman/#t=0:41:28):**  I want to thank you both so much for your time.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:13):**  You won't be listening to a typical episode of this podcast.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:17):**  We'll take a deep dive into greenhouses for the production of vegetables.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:21):**  Why?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:22):**  Because the middle class in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East is booming and  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:24):**  they're going to their local supermarket and they're demanding fresh and healthy vegetables,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:29):**  which are now trucked or flown in from thousands of kilometers away.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:32):**  So get ready for a lesson on soil-less, high-tech greenhouse production, CO2, freshness and  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:38):**  urbanization.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:39):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:40):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:46):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:48):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:52):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:00:58):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:02):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:04):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:08):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:11):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:15):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:20):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:24):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:28):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:32):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:36):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:41):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:45):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:50):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:52):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:01:58):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:00):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:01):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:06):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:07):**  Today I'm talking to Dirk Aleven, CEO of Foodventures.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:11):**  Foodventures develops and operates high-tech greenhouses, close to markets and cities with  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:15):**  large vegetable imports, like Kazakhstan, Turkey, Japan, Georgia and Ukraine.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:20):**  The focus of agriculture in this case is mostly focused on the regeneration of local communities,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:25):**  bringing production and jobs closer to the consumer and not so much on the soil aspects.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:31):**  But we're going to ask Dirk all about this.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:33):**  Welcome Dirk!  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:34):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:35):**  Thank you Koen for hosting me.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:37):**  And to start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:38):**  How did you end up in the world of building high-tech, sustainable greenhouses in places  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:44):**  like Ukraine, Japan, Georgia?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:47):**  Well that's a good question indeed.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:50):**  You must be wondering about that yourself every now and then.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:53):**  Yeah I'm not educated in agriculture.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:02:56):**  My first company, which I started back in 2004, that was a meet-in.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:03):**  We were organizing all kinds of business trips for Dutch entrepreneurs to emerging markets.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:10):**  So we were traveling with groups of entrepreneurs to China, to Brazil, India, Eastern Europe,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:16):**  all kinds of places.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:19):**  And one of the things I noticed was that almost in every big city and emerging markets we  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:24):**  were entering, the international retail was already active.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:29):**  And they were complaining about the supply of fresh vegetables.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:33):**  So basically they could get all the supplies they needed.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:35):**  But the issue of fresh vegetables was pretty big.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:40):**  So I noticed that the Dutch are one of the best worldwide in producing fresh vegetables,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:46):**  distribution of fresh vegetables.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:48):**  The whole chain is one of the most professionally organized industries around the globe.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:56):**  So we started looking into that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:03:59):**  And the first idea was to see if we could support the industry to export their technologies  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:05):**  to new markets.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:08):**  But that was already done.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:10):**  We saw pretty high-tech greenhouses built everywhere around the globe.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:15):**  In fact 90% of the Dutch or 90% of the greenhouses worldwide outside of Europe are supplied by  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:23):**  Dutch technology providers.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:26):**  But the real issue was that nobody knew how to use these new technologies.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:30):**  So we visited several greenhouses in Eastern Europe which were underperforming.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:37):**  Yields were, well, 30%, 40% less than expected.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:43):**  Which is a problem because these are huge investments per hectare.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:47):**  We're going to dive into some numbers later.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:49):**  But if you're underperforming here it really is a problem as a unit because they're high-tech  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:56):**  and require a lot of cash to start, a lot of capital.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:04:59):**  And then you don't want to be 30%, 40% under your targets I guess.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:04):**  It's absolutely a huge issue.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:06):**  The issue would be even bigger if it was in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:09):**  And then for sure they would face financial crises followed by bankruptcies.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:14):**  The fact that they didn't in those markets was simply because the prices for the goods  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:19):**  sold was pretty high.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:23):**  So the low yields were compensated by extremely high prices.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:28):**  And that was explained by the fact that these markets are net importers.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:31):**  So they were importing, well, Russia as a good example is importing tomatoes from Europe  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:39):**  as far as Israel, Spain, the Netherlands, shipping them for like 3,000, 4,000 kilometers  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:47):**  by refrigerated trucks, bringing them to the consumer.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:50):**  So you can understand that the prices for the fresh vegetables are extremely high.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:05:56):**  Another example is Asia, whereas Malaysia is importing by air freight Dutch thrust tomatoes.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:03):**  So the export price of the Dutch tomato is roughly 80 cents, where it ends up at $4 per  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:09):**  kilo in Malaysia.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:11):**  So just to get it right, they are flying in Dutch tomatoes from greenhouses here in the  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:16):**  Netherlands because there's not the level of sun you might expect to Malaysia to supply  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:23):**  supermarkets there.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:24):**  Well, everything is there in Malaysia.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:27):**  And everything is flown in.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:28):**  Wow.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:29):**  So technically, you could absolutely produce in Malaysia, but nobody does it today.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:34):**  So they are forced to import it.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:36):**  Same goes for Singapore.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:39):**  Perhaps you've seen the news that the Dutch growers are extremely proud on the fact that  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:43):**  they can supply bell peppers from the Netherlands to China air freight.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:48):**  So it's ridiculous.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:49):**  So basically, we're...  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:51):**  Let's not even start about food kilometers there.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:06:54):**  So this was the reason that we got interested in this industry and we've noticed the huge  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:01):**  lack of know-how on how to grow in high-tech greenhouses.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:07):**  So we decided to do it ourselves.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:09):**  I had no know-how in growing either, but I was lucky enough to involve Dutch growers  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:16):**  into my business.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:18):**  So we locked in some really experienced Dutch growers who already had experience in growing  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:24):**  outside the Netherlands as well in Mexico and in Russia and among other countries around  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:30):**  the world.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:31):**  And we started our first project in Ukraine, building a greenhouse to produce salad, which  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:36):**  we are supplying to the local supermarkets in Ukraine.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:40):**  So that answers your question a bit on how I ended up building greenhouses in Eastern  
**[0:07:47-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:47):**  Europe by accident and by seeing the need that we didn't only want to export technology,  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:07:56):**  we wanted to invest ourselves, commit ourselves and transfer the know-how to use the technologies.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:02):**  Because otherwise it would be one of those many cases where something very high-tech  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:06):**  is shipped from, in this case, a very high-tech country, it arrives, maybe it works for a  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:10):**  bit and then either it falls apart or starts, like you said, underperforming, which we've  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:15):**  seen a thousand times in history and probably will see a thousand times in the future as  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:20):**  well with something high-tech coming somewhere where there is no, let's say, good ground  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:26):**  for something high-tech.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:27):**  I mean, unless you're operating it yourself.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:29):**  In other industries you do see better examples where technology and know-how go hand in hand  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:34):**  and operators are more professionally organized and connect themselves with the technology  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:41):**  providers.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:42):**  But in the oil industry, who would even consider buying high-tech equipment without an operator  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:48):**  involved?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:49):**  I mean, that's absolutely nonsense.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:51):**  So how come it's not like that in the high-tech greenhouse industry?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:08:56):**  I guess because the industry in the Netherlands has developed over generations as a mom and  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:01):**  dad business.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:02):**  So it's mainly family-owned businesses, rather like smaller scale.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:08):**  Now we're entering a phase where there's more consolidation and the companies are getting  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:14):**  bigger.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:15):**  But so far it has been literally thousands of growers in the Netherlands organized through  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:21):**  corporations.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:22):**  So not having the right scale nor the interest to go abroad.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:27):**  So the operators themselves, they love the Netherlands, which I do as well, but they  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:31):**  feel comfortable here and they have the whole industry organized in the Netherlands.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:37):**  And they have no interest in going abroad.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:41):**  Investing in Ukraine or Kazakhstan or whatever, it requires a different skill set than just  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:47):**  being a grower or just being the best grower.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:51):**  And to look at Ukraine as an example, can you explain why, first of all, why the shift  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:09:57):**  to supermarkets and thus also more off-season vegetables and why you cannot just grow them  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:04):**  outside on a non-high-tech, not inside a high-tech greenhouse?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:08):**  Why is it such an interesting country and such an interesting example for your approach?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:14):**  So I guess what happened so far is that in Ukraine people had the time to grow some of  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:21):**  their vegetables in their backyards.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:24):**  And now more and more families are depending on two incomes.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:30):**  They're living inside the cities.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:31):**  So there's a huge urbanization like everywhere in the globe.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:35):**  So they don't have the time to go outside the city, go to their dachas, their family  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:39):**  gardens to grow vegetables.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:41):**  So they start buying the vegetables in the supermarkets.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:45):**  And once they are in the supermarkets, they expect, first of all, fresh vegetable.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:51):**  They expect it to be available whenever they go to the supermarket, not depending on the  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:58):**  season.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:10:59):**  And they expect it to be safe because they think and expect that the procurement department  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:05):**  of a supermarket is paying attention to quality and food safety.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:10):**  So that's the consumer end of the part of the case.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:17):**  In terms of supply, there are still a lot of smallholders which do not make that transition  
**[0:11:22-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:22):**  from the traditional seasonal production to more extended production throughout the year.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:31):**  So there's a gap between the more professional and modern consumers and the old fashioned  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:40):**  way of producing tomatoes and cucumbers.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:42):**  Now it looks, for some of them, it looks like it has a sort of a nice sound of having outside  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:51):**  grown vegetables on a smaller scale.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:11:55):**  But reality is that those suppliers, they use a lot of chemicals because they have a  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:00):**  huge influence of weather and insects outside.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:06):**  And there's absolutely no traceability.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:07):**  So in fact, they can be good supplies, of course, if you know them.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:12):**  But there is also a big group who wants to have a decent yield out of open field production.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:20):**  But they have a huge pressure of insects and all kinds of diseases which they fight with  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:27):**  a high doses of chemicals.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:29):**  So we think that there's a better alternative if you do it in a protected environment, a  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:35):**  controlled environment and have the right skill to prove your traceability of the products  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:39):**  and the safety of your products.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:42):**  And that means in this case, close to the consumer or relatively close to the big urban  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:47):**  areas you are building or you have built in this case, high tech greenhouses and are operating  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:53):**  them as well.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:54):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:12:56):**  If you compare that with other industries like bakeries or something, I mean, you would  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:01):**  be surprised if the supermarkets buy their breads from thousands of households who are  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:08):**  baking their breads somewhere in the backyard.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:11):**  But that's in fact what's now happening in Ukraine with vegetables.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:15):**  So we think it's more logical that you have more organized and larger scale production  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:21):**  of vegetables close to those markets who are depending on the imports right now.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:26):**  And when you look at, I mean, the moment somebody says greenhouses, everybody immediately thinks  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:31):**  or not everyone, many people would think energy use, sustainability.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:35):**  I mean, you already highlighted a bit on herbicides and pesticides.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:39):**  Can you talk a bit about the energy use and sustainability in general as obviously the  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:43):**  sector in the Netherlands has been moving away from heavy gas and heavy energy use?  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:49):**  I mean, what are the things you've seen and the things you have put to work in this case  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:55):**  in Ukraine and in other countries?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:13:57):**  So I totally agree that a few decades ago nobody was caring about energy inputs in the  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:04):**  Netherlands.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:05):**  And that's the reason why some people have bad memories or a bad impression on the industry  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:11):**  itself.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:12):**  Like today everybody is, well, from a sustainability angle and from a financial angle looking for  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:20):**  alternatives on energy because the energy use in the end makes like around one third  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:28):**  of the cost price of your product.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:31):**  Plus consumers start asking how do you produce your goods and what is your source of energy.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:38):**  In Georgia we are using geothermal energy.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:42):**  So in fact we're almost not using gas at all.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:46):**  And the gas that we use, we use the carbon dioxide coming from it as a fertilizer for  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:53):**  the plants.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:54):**  So we're CO2 neutral.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:14:58):**  In Ukraine we use biomass as an alternative energy for two reasons.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:04):**  First one to be more sustainable in our heating of course, but second one is that the gas  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:09):**  is expensive in Ukraine so we also want to have alternatives.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:13):**  And again the gas that we use is purely from the need of CO2.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:17):**  So we're almost CO2 neutral there as well.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:22):**  And in Kazakhstan we're using cogeneration.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:25):**  So by cogeneration we're using flare gas.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:28):**  That's gas which normally is burned, simply burned after the oil production.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:34):**  So not used at all.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:35):**  These are the big flames you see on top of pipes if you happen to live close to oil production  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:41):**  or refineries.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:42):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:43):**  And we're using that gas and generating electricity from it and the remaining heat which is coming  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:49):**  from this electricity generation we're using for heating the greenhouse.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:15:54):**  So if I look at the industry today it's in the genes of every grower to think about energy  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:00):**  saving.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:02):**  And the suppliers, if you look at the energy consumption today it's almost like 60% less  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:13):**  than 20 years ago.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:15):**  And that's one of the reasons why the old greenhouses are now disappearing in Ukraine.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:20):**  They were still used to very cheap gas in the Soviet Union so their gas consumption  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:25):**  was extremely high.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:26):**  And they're super leaky basically.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:28):**  Yeah, super leaky and they didn't have any strategies on how to use energy.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:33):**  So today the know-how is developed as such in the Netherlands that the growers they know  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:40):**  when heating is absolutely required, when it's sort of less comfortable and when it's  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:45):**  not needed.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:46):**  So they look at the absolute need and say well in these periods of the day we absolutely  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:52):**  need heating.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:53):**  There's no alternatives on it.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:16:57):**  Or they might consider well we could use a little bit less and that results in extremely  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:04):**  lower gas consumption.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:07):**  But it does sound funny or weird that I'm burning gas to make CO2, something we're all  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:14):**  trying to fight to have less of, for my plants in the greenhouse to eat.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:20):**  You can imagine for non-greenhouse people that it does sound a bit weird.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:25):**  If we would only use it for generating CO2 I would totally agree.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:30):**  What we do use is we work the other way around.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:32):**  So we say how much CO2 do we need and in what period.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:38):**  And then we burn the gas.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:40):**  With that burning process we create heat which we store in a heat storage tank.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:46):**  And that heat storage tank we can use the heat at the moment we need it.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:51):**  For instance, in the greenhouse, all the greenhouses that we build right now, they have these heat  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:56):**  storage tanks.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:17:58):**  During the day when the plant is extremely active they use a lot of CO2.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:02):**  So we start heating or burning the gas.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:06):**  We store that heat in the heat storage tank and when the plant is asleep in the night  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:10):**  but still needs a nice temperature we use the heating which we have stored in the heat  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:15):**  storage tank.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:16):**  So it's not that we are purely burning the gas for the purpose of CO2 dosing.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:24):**  It's a duo use basically.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:26):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:27):**  And would it be because I've heard and I'm following that industry just a bit like the  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:32):**  carbon capture industry that's trying to drastically lower the price of capturing CO2 from the  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:39):**  air and making it available for industries like maybe the greenhouse industry.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:45):**  Of course the bottling industry that needs it for your Coca-Cola bottle.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:48):**  Would it be something, but then you don't have the heat, would it be something in the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:50):**  future that you could be as an industry client of this new emerging industry that hopefully  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:18:56):**  for a very low price will be storing will be liquefying CO2 so you can use it?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:01):**  Is that something you're dreaming of?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:03):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:04):**  Because it results directly in higher yields.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:08):**  So the plants immediately transform CO2 into tomatoes or cucumbers.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:14):**  So we would absolutely be buying CO2.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:19):**  As a result, the beauty of a greenhouse is that it's a direct user of heating and direct  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:25):**  user of CO2.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:26):**  So you could connect those greenhouses to, for instance, energy plants or any industry  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:33):**  which has a waste heat.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:35):**  The disadvantage today is that if you have waste heat only, you still have a lack of  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:40):**  CO2.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:41):**  You could supply that if you could take those two things apart.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:44):**  That would be fantastic.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:45):**  At the moment, there's no CO2 for a good price for you.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:49):**  Well, there is.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:51):**  So it's a matter of math.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:53):**  So sometimes we are interested in buying it.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:19:58):**  You see that happening in the Netherlands where the industry is more developed.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:00):**  So distribution of liquid CO2 is better.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:04):**  That's a bit of a problem in countries like Georgia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan where the  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:09):**  industry is not developed yet to supply us liquid CO2 at a reasonable price.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:15):**  Otherwise, we would definitely consider not using any gas.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:19):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:20):**  And when you look, let's tackle another big one, people that say everything should be  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:24):**  grown in soil.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:25):**  What's your normal reply to that?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:29):**  So we would need a drastic reduction of consumption of vegetables.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:35):**  I mean, let me take an example in Georgia.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:41):**  We took over a greenhouse which was underperforming and it was producing in the soil in a greenhouse.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:48):**  So we took over and we started, the first thing we did was taking samples of the soil  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:54):**  and it was absolutely exhausted after three years already.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:20:59):**  We could see the results as well in terms of yields.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:02):**  First year was more or less reasonable and then the yields went down by 20 to 30 percent  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:09):**  per year and the soil was completely exhausted.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:12):**  So I do understand it has a bit of an industry feel on the natural product with growing soil.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:23):**  So I do understand that people have question marks about it.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:27):**  So how we use it is that we are growing soilless means that we're using substrate and that  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:34):**  allows us to dose exactly the amount of water and fertilizers that the plant needs.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:41):**  Nothing more, nothing less.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:43):**  So if you look at things like water consumption, for instance, our water consumption in a soilless  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:49):**  environment is 10 times less than an open field production.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:54):**  That's getting extremely important in countries like Kazakhstan where there's a lack of water  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:21:59):**  at the moment.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:01):**  In terms of fertilizers, we add the fertilizers through the water and we have a drain system.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:07):**  So whatever the plant is not absorbing, we collect it in the drains.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:12):**  It's coming back in a drain pit which is cleaned with UV again and then we reuse those same  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:17):**  fertilizers.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:18):**  So we reduce 30% compared to a non-drain system.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:24):**  And if you would compare that with an open field production, that's even more.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:29):**  So in those terms, we're much more sustainable than open field production.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:36):**  So my answer would be like it's more of a question like how many people do we think  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:42):**  we can feed on this planet?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:44):**  And I think we all understand that there are more people coming.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:47):**  So we should be finding ways on reducing the inputs, maximizing the outputs so that we  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:52):**  have a maximum transformation from input to food.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:22:55):**  Yeah, I think it all depends on the context and you should depend on your tomatoes compared  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:00):**  to something that apparently is flown in or trucked in from 5000 kilometers away.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:06):**  And all those kilometers also mean inputs in the sense of diesel for the truck, diesel  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:14):**  for cooling it, etc.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:16):**  And in terms of, because I mentioned that at the beginning, in terms of jobs, and then  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:20):**  we look at a concrete example and how do you finance it, but what is the, because they're  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:24):**  super high tech, meaning probably less people and mostly automated, how many people are  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:29):**  working in an average one hectare or half a hectare high tech greenhouse with you?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:35):**  So rough numbers are 10 to 15 persons per hectare.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:43):**  So we're in a normal scale greenhouse, so we have two small ones, one in Georgia, which  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:49):**  is two and a half hectares.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:52):**  And we have around 60 persons working there.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:23:55):**  It's a little bit more because you need all your overhead stuff like sales, administration,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:02):**  distribution.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:03):**  We do our distribution ourselves, so we supply directly to those supermarkets.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:09):**  And the one we're building now in Kazakhstan, it starts with five hectares and it's growing  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:13):**  to 20.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:14):**  That will be, well, starting point roughly 70 to 80 in the beginning and then we'll end  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:22):**  up somewhere around 200 to 250 people working there.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:27):**  And that's year round because you're not seasonal, which is a huge thing in agriculture.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:33):**  And we aim to keep our staff as much as possible.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:36):**  So in Georgia, we have the same staff since the beginning because in the end, the yields  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:42):**  are determined by the know-how of your staff, not only the grower, of course.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:46):**  So we want to make sure that everyone who works with us stays with us.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:50):**  So we pay very decent salaries.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:24:53):**  We try to create very transparent culture and conditions so that people absolutely know  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:02):**  that they're safe working with us and they have a long-term vision on working with us.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:07):**  And as a result, we see also that people are starting to spend, which is very nice to see.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:11):**  Like on the first year, they simply work for a salary and in the second and third year,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:17):**  they start feeling security from the company and also start developing their spendings  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:25):**  back home in the families.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:26):**  You have to try to imagine an environment where the unemployment is roughly 30 to 40  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:33):**  percent, where that's in the countries that we work in and especially in the countryside.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:38):**  So the difference we can make for those who are working with us is huge.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:42):**  Yeah, and let's not forget you need customers to be able to buy your produce at the end.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:49):**  I mean, it would be great if you automate, no it wouldn't be, but it could be like an  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:53):**  entrepreneur's dream to automate everything, but at the end, nobody can buy your tomatoes.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:58):**  Who are you producing for?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:25:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:01):**  And in fact, there are too many inputs in the greenhouse to fully automate it.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:06):**  So it's a living product.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:09):**  It needs a hybrid.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:11):**  And in terms of, in this case, Kazakhstan, if that's a great example, can you dive a  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:16):**  bit deeper into some of the numbers if you want to share them just for people to have  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:21):**  an idea of how asset heavy and capital heavy these type of investments are and what comes  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:27):**  out of it and how you're structuring it now?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:29):**  Because you're thinking about a fund, you're thinking about different vehicles to speed  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:34):**  up basically because you obviously not finance it all yourself.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, so it's an absolutely an industry which requires a lot of capital.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:43):**  So the setup itself in Kazakhstan is that we start with all the infrastructure works  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:49):**  and the head house and the overhead buildings for 20 hectares plus a first five hectare  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:55):**  of operation.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:26:59):**  That investment we're doing right now this year, that's 18 million euros.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:03):**  That includes the co-gen, that includes all the overhead works and the five hectare operation.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:11):**  This particular one we funded, we are co-funded by an agricultural fund, which is the Silk  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:21):**  Road Agricultural Growth Fund, a private equity fund under international management.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:29):**  And we invested ourselves along with them.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:34):**  We had $12 million in equity and the remaining in local debt.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:42):**  That allows us, of course, this first phase to be up and running, but as well the second  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:47):**  five hectares.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:49):**  So compared to the first five hectares, we expected a budget of 18 million euros and  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:54):**  the second one should be done for another, let's say, 12.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:27:59):**  So we end up at 30 million for the first 10 hectares operation.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:04):**  That's high, but that's high because of the large part of which is coming from the co-gens.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:12):**  So normally you would look at roughly, like the rough numbers, 200 euros per square meter.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:18):**  So 2 million per hectare investment.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:21):**  You're about 50% up, but also because you're already building most of it for 20 hectares,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:26):**  right?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:27):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:28):**  And the co-gen part.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:29):**  So our returns are also higher.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:31):**  We generate our electricity ourselves.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:35):**  So your fixed costs are higher, but your input costs are a lot lower.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:38):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:39):**  So the co-gens itself have a return of five years.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:43):**  Normally we look at the greenhouses as, well, based on the 2 million euro investment per  
**[0:28:49-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/09/21/dirk-aleven/#t=0:28:49):**  year you might expect a 1 million euro revenue per year.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:00:00)
## 182 Liz Carlisle – Regeneration is nothing new, let’s honour the indigenous history  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:14):**  Something we don't talk about enough, the deep racism in agriculture and food and honestly  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:19):**  also in the regenerative agriculture movement.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:21):**  We stand on the shoulders of giants in the indigenous farming and land management space,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:26):**  but choose not to mention them.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:28):**  All practices we currently call regenerative are not new but have been around for a long,  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:32):**  long time and we choose broadly not to acknowledge that and look away when it comes to thorny  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:37):**  topics like land ownership, access to land, access to finance, access to conferences and  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:42):**  access to podcasts like this.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:44):**  So let's get real and uncomfortable and discuss things like the real origin story of the green  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:48):**  revolution, the black farming movement in the US and the deep roots of colonization  
**[0:00:53-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:53):**  in the agriculture space and what we can and have to learn from that.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:00):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:05):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:09):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:14):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:19):**  Try my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:23):**  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:28):**  and consume.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:29):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:34):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:04):**  Today we have a very special episode where we have one of our first guests back on the  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:08):**  podcast.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:09):**  She was guest in the episode number 18.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:12):**  So that's almost four and a half years ago.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:15):**  And Liz Carlyle has written a new book, actually has written a lot in the meantime, but we  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:18):**  had her last time for the Lento Underground, which I would anybody strongly suggest to  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:24):**  read it.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:25):**  But she's back now with Healing Grounds, which has been an amazing book.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:27):**  I really, really enjoyed it.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:29):**  And I'm very happy to have Liz back on the podcast.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:32):**  Welcome.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:33):**  I'm delighted to be here and to reconnect, touch base.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:36):**  Yeah, a lot has happened in this space.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:38):**  We're going to get to that as well because you've been observing this space, quote unquote,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:43):**  the state of regeneration space for a while as well.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:46):**  But first, let's start what triggered you to to write another book?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:51):**  I mean, it's always a massive undertaking.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:53):**  I think I've never done it.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:54):**  I've just seen it from outside and far away.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:58):**  Instead of articles or essays or papers, I mean, you didn't have to write this book.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:03):**  What made this book a book that had to be written and had to be written by you?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:08):**  Yeah, that last question is a tough one.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:10):**  I don't know if I have the answer to that, you know, whether I'm the right author for  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:13):**  this book, but I did feel a real sense of urgency about this book.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:18):**  And I think it's, you know, it's been a long journey for me trying to understand this idea  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:25):**  of regeneration and regenerative agriculture and what is really required of us as people  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:32):**  to regenerate, you know, soil carbon, which is sort of where I started this investigation  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:39):**  12 years ago as a researcher and writer.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:42):**  But I've just continually tried to understand the deeper layers of regeneration and in many  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:48):**  cases the root causes of why we have an extractive agriculture in the first place that would  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:54):**  take carbon out of soil and put it into the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:58):**  Why on earth did society get to a place where that somehow made sense?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:03):**  And so this book digs further back in history to understand this as a process that got started  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:09):**  several hundred years ago.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:12):**  And I think also, you know, for me has a sense of urgency around the social change that's  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:17):**  necessary for us to solve the climate problems in agriculture, which I now understand to  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:24):**  be really, really deeply wedded to questions of social justice.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:28):**  Yeah, it's been fascinating.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:30):**  I tumbled into the Regen movement as well about 12 years ago on the carbon side and  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:37):**  on peeling the onion further and further you get to why would it make sense to unleash  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:43):**  all that carbon, which has such a crucial role in the soil.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:48):**  And we know now how to, and we have known before how to restore that and why don't we  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:54):**  or haven't we done at scale yet?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:57):**  And I think there's, yeah, it's not about the techniques.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:59):**  The techniques are there and we know how to do it.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:03):**  Let's say we know the scientific research and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:05):**  But the question is why, why haven't we?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:08):**  And you go back also to a very interesting, of course, I will put links to the book below.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:13):**  One of the things that really struck me apart from really reading about the history of the  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:17):**  regeneration movement or the history of, of Regen, which goes way further than we normally  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:22):**  hear let's say, but one moment was very, very fascinating on the green revolution where  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:29):**  that started.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:30):**  We've all known like in Mexico in that research Institute, they started pushing on certain  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:34):**  inputs, et cetera, but that's not the full story.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:37):**  Like the story started actually before that and had a very different intent and a Rockefeller  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:41):**  funding, Rockefeller foundation funding that started the whole thing had a very different  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:44):**  intent when they started.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:46):**  So shall we unpack that a bit and then go to the rest of the book?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:50):**  Yeah, I was fascinated by the story as well because you know, when I first started getting  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:55):**  into regenerative agriculture or organic agriculture, which is what I was first introduced to, I  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:02):**  pretty early on heard about this kind of boogie man, the bad guy on the other side, Norman  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:08):**  Borlaug, who had won the Nobel peace prize in the early seventies for his work on hybrid  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:15):**  grain.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:17):**  And I learned that Borlaug's approach was, you know, very, very high yielding monocultures  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:23):**  of grain using high inputs of fossil fuel based chemicals, meaning fertilizers, herbicides,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:30):**  other kinds of pesticides, as well as intensive irrigation.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:35):**  And so, you know, for me, just getting into the organic farming movement and agroecology,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:40):**  I was interested in an approach that was much lower input, accessible to people in all kinds  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:45):**  of environments rather than this really high input.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:49):**  You know, the point is just to get high yielding corn or wheat under ideal conditions.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:54):**  So I had learned about Norman Borlaug, you know, I knew he was affiliated with the Rockefeller  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:59):**  program and this thing was called the Green Revolution, and it had undermined the livelihoods  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:05):**  of smallholder farmers around the world who couldn't access these expensive fertilizers  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:11):**  and herbicides and irrigation.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:13):**  And so the, you know, the market that they had counted on for what they produced fell  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:18):**  out, you know, from under them as these high input producers kind of captured the global  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:24):**  export market.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:25):**  So I had heard about that story, and I understood this kind of struggle between two visions  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:30):**  of agriculture, one that was very, you know, high input and sort of technology intensive  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:36):**  and more accessible to people with more resources, and one that was sort of more democratic and  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:41):**  low input and ecological and in my view, consistent with what we need to do on climate and other  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:47):**  ecological challenges.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:49):**  But I think the story I hadn't learned was that even within the Rockefeller Foundation,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:55):**  prior to Borlaug's ascent to power, there was a debate about what it meant to, you know,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:05):**  pursue technical assistance for agricultural producers in Mexico in the early 20th century.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:11):**  Not everybody believed in a high input approach.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:14):**  And even when Borlaug did ultimately win the day on pursuing, you know, a lot of chemicals  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:20):**  rather than compost and cover crops and things we now talk about in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:25):**  circles, there was this massive resistance movement in Mexico, led by indigenous people,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:31):**  that not only has shaped Mexican history and Latin American history, but actually led to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:36):**  the creation of the field of agroecology, my research field, and has also shaped history  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:43):**  throughout the Americas and throughout the world.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:46):**  Because it was those smallholders and indigenous people in Mexico fighting Borlaug's vision,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:52):**  who articulated the alternative that now I think has so much relevance within climate  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:59):**  discussions and discussions of a more ecological agriculture, which for them also was about,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:05):**  you know, having power over their own livelihoods and communities.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah, that's fascinating to see, of course, when it was, but also, I think the original  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:15):**  funding even was focused on that work to understand the agroecology or whatever it was called  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:21):**  at that moment.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:22):**  And of course, the terminology is different.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:24):**  But the original funding or original project was to understand that better and to research  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:30):**  that.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:31):**  And then somehow it became, it took a right or left turn, whatever you want to call it,  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:34):**  but took a different turn by certain influences to go on the high input, high output.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:42):**  But let's not forget many of the these quote unquote, peasant farmers had an incredible  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:46):**  high output, with a very, very low input, like the whole feeding the world discussion.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:50):**  Let's not go there, because that's irrelevant.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:53):**  And in many cases, nonsense.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:55):**  They were out competing everything, but they were just simply pushed out of the way.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:00):**  Because of the input side, because of the hybrids, because of much, but the original  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:03):**  idea of the Rockefeller project seemed to be actually quite focused on agroecology and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:08):**  understanding why these peasants and smallholder farmers were so incredibly productive over  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:13):**  time without losing fertility without a lot of inputs.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:17):**  And then somehow, they took another turn and got into the high input train.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:24):**  What can we learn there?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:25):**  What can we learn?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:26):**  Because it was a very small funding and was a very small amount actually at the time and  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:31):**  probably a bit more and but now even less that sort of changed the course of history.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:35):**  What can we learn there from very good intentions?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:38):**  I think if we look at the original plan was very agroecology focused that rotations of  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:42):**  composting, let's learn from solar farmers.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:45):**  And then 10 years later, or I don't know the timeframe, whoop, it went all the way to the  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:48):**  other side and became this extreme colonization for us that that has cost us a lot.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:58):**  I think that's absolutely the right question because I do think this tale of the Rockefeller  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:03):**  Foundation's Mexican agricultural program is a cautionary tale for funders and investors  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:11):**  in regenerative agriculture because you're absolutely right at the beginning when this  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:16):**  program was first getting started in the 30s.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:20):**  If you sort of think about the cast of characters involved, it wasn't too different from, you  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:25):**  know, I'm in the United States, you know, sort of like Bernie Sanders type of supporters,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:29):**  you know, Elizabeth Warren type of supporters.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:31):**  It was a group of progressives who were connected within philanthropic circles and who are also  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:37):**  pretty connected to the New Deal project and the idea of big social programs that were  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:43):**  public in the 30s coming out of the Depression, who, by and large, really admired the Mexican  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:50):**  Revolution and the land reform that happened in Mexico as Mexico transitioned from these  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:56):**  big haciendas, these big estates where people were essentially all but enslaved and these  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:03):**  large tracts of land were owned by just, you know, a few people in the country to, you  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:08):**  know, this land reform where a lot of people got their own parcel to farm and there was  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:13):**  this more kind of, you know, food sovereignty type of vision for how agriculture and the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:18):**  economy would proceed in Mexico.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:20):**  The Mexican agricultural program of the Rockefeller Foundation was originally full of people who  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:26):**  believed in that vision.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:28):**  They saw it as sort of consistent with Jeffersonian American democracy, this idea that a nation  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:33):**  of small farmers is, you know, the basis of a democratic nation and this is a good basis  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:39):**  for the economy to have people having access to their own ability to produce food for their  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:45):**  own communities.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:46):**  So that's where the Mexican agricultural program started is how do we support these small farmers  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:52):**  who've just gotten on their ajitos, these small tracts of land that people got as part  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:56):**  of the land reform, with technical assistance that's appropriate to them.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:01):**  So knowing that these aren't people with the money to buy commercial fertilizers, a lot  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:05):**  of these people don't have access to irrigation, they might be at high elevation.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:09):**  And so the original, you know, pursuit was how do we support corn farmers because that  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:15):**  was the subsistence crop?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:17):**  And how do we support them with things like, yeah, composting, cover crops, all these things  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:22):**  that we think of as regenerative or organic or sustainable.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:26):**  And what changed?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:27):**  You know, Norman Borlaug, when he first got there, he was kind of, by all accounts, a  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:33):**  little bit arrogant.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:35):**  He was from Iowa, he'd seen the beginnings of industrial, high yielding agriculture,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:39):**  and he really did believe that this sort of technologically driven approach to higher  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:45):**  yields was a better way.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:46):**  And he had a lot of disdain for small farmers and for sort of biological strategies rather  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:52):**  than chemical ones.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:54):**  But when he first showed up at the Mexican agricultural program as this young plant pathologist  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:59):**  talking about how he'd rather work with, you know, larger landowners growing wheat than  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:04):**  the small farmers growing corn, he was kind of marginalized.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:08):**  And in fact, he actually threatened to quit because he was so pissed off about having  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:12):**  to work with small farmers who he thought would have looked different.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:18):**  It's interesting to think about it.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:20):**  Norbert Borlaug would have quit.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:22):**  And back to Iowa and work there.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:25):**  I mean, I don't think you could have stopped the force.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:28):**  I mean, there was a I mean, we we can idolize about that and at the same time.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:33):**  But it's interesting.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:35):**  So those crucial moments shaped history.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:38):**  And what happened was the Cold War.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:42):**  I mean, there you know, there's some complexity to it and some other factors.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:46):**  Certainly there were some important elements in politics in Mexico as well as the sort  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:51):**  of folks who originally involved in the land reform, you know, moved out of power and newer  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:58):**  folks came into power who were more interested in, you know, closer ties with the US economy,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:03):**  for example.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:04):**  But but the biggest force of change was the Cold War.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:08):**  And so this was a huge influence on the way the Rockefeller leadership thought about all  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:14):**  their programs and all their investments.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:16):**  And so this Mexican agricultural program that had originally been directed to try to accomplish  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:24):**  something within the context of Mexico itself and specifically support those local efforts,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:31):**  something that that might then have lessons for parts of the US that were also trying  
**[0:15:34-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:34):**  to recover from not dissimilar dynamics, honestly, of, you know, really stratified social class  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:43):**  and wealth dynamics.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:45):**  But originally, the Mexican agricultural program, it was trying to solve a local problem.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:49):**  But in the context of the Cold War, all of a sudden, these sort of influential public  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:54):**  intellectuals were talking to the leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation, saying, if  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:59):**  we as the United States and the free world want to win the Cold War against the communists,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:06):**  we need to pay close attention to the quote unquote, third world, that is the countries  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:12):**  that haven't yet aligned themselves with the free world, or the communists.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:19):**  And these are countries that struggle with poverty.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:22):**  And these are countries that struggle with food insecurity.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:25):**  And so there was this belief in the United States and much of Europe that the need was  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:30):**  for food aid programs and also exportable technologies to ensure that these countries  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:37):**  in the quote unquote, third world didn't become so food insecure, that their hunger left them  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:44):**  vulnerable to communism.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:46):**  That was a really influential political theory in the 1950s.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:51):**  And because this political theory was so influential, all of a sudden, the decision.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:57):**  Rockefeller was like, Oh, we need to turn our program into we need to create a model  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:02):**  for how small farmers all over the world are all of a sudden going to produce these high  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:06):**  yields so that we can win the Cold War.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:08):**  So forget about what we're trying to do locally in Mexico.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:13):**  That's not as important now.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:14):**  One of the most diverse regions, rowing techniques that go back centuries.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:20):**  And you see the effects, it just completely wiped out the small departments, they couldn't  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:23):**  afford it as soon as they were under any kind of depth bandwagon, high yield.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:28):**  I mean, you cannot get off anymore.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:29):**  I mean, we now know how difficult that is.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:32):**  You get addicted literally, or get wiped out.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:35):**  And we've seen that happen time and time again.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:37):**  It's very interesting that yeah, an outside force in this case, global politics, and we  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:42):**  might live in a time where that happens again, is shaping a very well intended program, but  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:47):**  of course, run by intellectuals very far away.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:51):**  And then it just morphs into a completely opposite beast, basically, which is fascinating  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:56):**  to look at, but also quite scary.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:59):**  And something that was, you know, at the beginning, much more contextual and nuanced and informed  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:04):**  by people within Rockefeller, who'd actually spent significant time in Mexico and were  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:09):**  working on, you know, more of a collaborative basis, it got replaced by something that was  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:15):**  not contextual, that was this sort of abstract idea that turned out to have a lot of holes  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:20):**  in it.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:21):**  But that, you know, the whole sort of public intellectual class and funder class at that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:28):**  time in the 50s just got caught up in this model of the world that was much more abstract  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:34):**  and that was, you know, proposing this sort of global principle rather than the sort of  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:39):**  nuanced contextual understandings of how to support agriculture in particular places.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:45):**  We run that same risk now as we are intellectual, like intellectualizing the region act, the  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:51):**  farmer should do this, the farmer should do that from a comfortable office far away, let's  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:55):**  say rural-urban divide.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:58):**  And of course, the Rockefellers actually announced a huge program on food, a food program in  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:04):**  the US, I think 105 million or something.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:08):**  And a lot of other things like is that, again, we would like the agriculture space to do  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:13):**  something or the farmers to do something, but we mostly talk from a distance without  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:18):**  understanding the local context.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:20):**  Do you see that as we are observing?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:22):**  Of course, it's easy.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:23):**  We're talking with our headphones on observing the space, but what do you see there?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah, I think there's a couple reverberations forward to our time.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:33):**  One, I think for me is the conversation about creating carbon markets, specifically in agriculture,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:40):**  which I think is envisioned as this kind of elegant and efficient global solution to creating  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:48):**  an incentive within agriculture for farmers to use practices that sequester carbon.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:54):**  And I think this, you know, sort of like some of the ideas that started to get sway within  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:00):**  Rockefeller almost 75 years ago now, is not as local and nuanced and contextual as I think  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:09):**  regeneration requires of us.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:13):**  I think the project of regeneration is actually very complex and very place-based and also  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:20):**  has a sort of social history.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:23):**  And so I think it's really important not to just imagine that the financial sector can  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:28):**  solve this problem simply by generating a market for soil carbon credits.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:33):**  And just some kind of simple examples of where I see potential problems here.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:38):**  It's difficult to generate the sort of measurement approaches or metrics at the molecular level.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:45):**  The science around measuring the movement of carbon through soil is still emerging.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:49):**  It's really interesting.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:50):**  I think it's really important that we invest in it and learn more about how this works.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:55):**  And I think it's pretty dangerous to pin all of our hopes for regeneration on trying to  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:00):**  measure something that we're still learning how to see at the molecular level.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:05):**  Whereas I think we have much more developed approaches for seeing functioning whole healthy  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:11):**  ecosystems when we look at plants and animals and sort of ecological restoration.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:18):**  So I think we shouldn't give up on some of these indicators that seem older and sort  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:23):**  of less sexy.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:25):**  But I think also a deeper issue with some of these molecular metrics is that the equipment  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:30):**  used is expensive.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:32):**  And in some cases, the sort of systems for tabulating and reporting can be expensive  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:39):**  or require staff or things like that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:42):**  And so it can become a mechanism, not unlike the Green Revolution, for shutting out the  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:49):**  very smallholder farmers who are essential to a project of regeneration if we understand  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:55):**  it holistically.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:57):**  So I think we should be careful around soil carbon credits.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:01):**  And then I think the other lesson from this Green Revolution story that's really relevant  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:05):**  today is just the importance of being attentive to power and not imagining that just coming  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:12):**  up with a really efficient technical approach is naturally going to accomplish regeneration  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:18):**  if we don't think about how our intervention is shifting power and also how power dynamics  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:25):**  are a part of the problem that we have in agriculture and that our solutions around  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:31):**  regeneration also need to address power imbalances.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:37):**  And one thing that comes up immediately, obviously, on power imbalances is access to land.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:42):**  You've written about that a lot in the book, in almost all the chapters, I think.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:48):**  And let's unpack that.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:49):**  I mean, it's way more for not just for one podcast, but the land ownership and access  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:55):**  to land, how much of that is really holding us back and why we're not talking about it  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:02):**  more?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:03):**  It seems like that elephant in the room that, or the bison or whatever, let's use a regenerative  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:08):**  or the whale, but that really doesn't get talked about a lot.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:13):**  And there's an enormous wealth transfer happening now where farmers are retiring, et cetera.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:18):**  But if you look at just simply diversity in land ownership in the US, I think that's the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:25):**  place with the best data and the worst data at the same time, the best accurate data.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:29):**  And it's really shocking to look at that.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:32):**  You sum it up in the book as well.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:34):**  The diversity is zero basically, or very, it's a running error.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:38):**  And why is that so much easier to talk about no-till or plowing and agroforestry than it  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:46):**  is to talk about who owns and why does somebody actually own a piece of land?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:50):**  And have you any idea about why is it so difficult to talk about that?  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:55):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:56):**  So white people, myself included, in general are fairly uncomfortable talking about race  
**[0:24:04-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:04):**  and facing up to in this country, the history of slavery and the legacy that that has left  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:12):**  and continued violence and discrimination against black people.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:16):**  And I think also very uncomfortable to talk about genocide of indigenous people, theft  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:22):**  of indigenous land, and being a settler colonist.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:26):**  That's an incredibly uncomfortable conversation.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:29):**  And I think a lot of white people in the United States haven't really known what to do about  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:36):**  it.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:37):**  I think have felt a lot of shame, are uncomfortable talking about it, and have no idea what to  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:42):**  do to begin addressing these challenges.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:44):**  And so it's kind of easier to just ignore them and not talk about them because they  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:49):**  seem, I think, to a lot of white people, intractable.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:53):**  That said, I do think that the Black Lives Matter movement, the movement for black lives  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:58):**  and the way in which that really reached the public consciousness in 2020 in the wake of  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:04):**  George Floyd's murder, I think has started to move the needle on conversations about  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:10):**  race in the United States and I think around the world.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:13):**  And I'm seeing a lot more people in regenerative agriculture and in the food and agriculture  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:18):**  sector in general talking about it and acknowledging the history of slavery as a key piece of the  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:25):**  history of agriculture in the US.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:26):**  Do you think enough people know about it?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:28):**  I read the book obviously as an outsider, or as the one that sent the columnist there.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:36):**  We're never an outsider, but enough people know the details are just horrifying.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:41):**  The details are the amount of land or the way in which it's been institutionalized,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:49):**  structuralized.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:50):**  It's really, really horrifying for somebody that sort of knew but didn't really know.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:54):**  Do you think enough people...  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:56):**  I mean, it's easy to look away, but it's also easy to look away if you don't know.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:00):**  Do you know what happened?  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:01):**  But farming and land has been a very, very central point of the discrimination and the  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:08):**  race movement.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:09):**  It's been very, very important to take first on the indigenous side and then also a lot  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:15):**  of farmers of color.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:16):**  And now there are not so many.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:17):**  It's been a very focal point on the rights on holding land, et cetera, and all the programs  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:24):**  have been designed not to help them basically.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:28):**  Do we know enough about it?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:29):**  Or the answer is very simply, no, we don't know the dirty history there.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:34):**  I think there's still a lot of work to do because I think your average person in the  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:40):**  US does not know this history.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:43):**  They might know that slavery happened.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:45):**  Although, I mean, a third of the people in this country are willing to deny a lot of  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:50):**  things about reality.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:52):**  But these are the statistics around agricultural land in the United States and they're very  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:58):**  stark.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:59):**  About 40 percent of the US population identifies as indigenous or people of color.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:06):**  And about 60 percent of the agricultural workers in the United States are people of color.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:14):**  And yet only 2 percent of agricultural land in the United States is owned by people of  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:20):**  color.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:21):**  So that's the contemporary reverberation of the experience of indigenous land being  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:28):**  stolen and black people being stolen from their homelands and then forced to labor in  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:34):**  this industrial food system in the US.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:36):**  And then, as you said, even up against so many obstacles, black people actually did  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:43):**  purchase a lot of agricultural land by the early 20th century, but then were dispossessed  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:49):**  of 98 percent of that through violence, lynching, people being run out of town who were land  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:55):**  owners by violent white mobs.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:57):**  And then also this really insidious financial racism because in the wake of the Depression,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:05):**  the US Department of Agriculture created loan programs in order to kind of get the agricultural  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:09):**  sector back on its feet.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:12):**  And these loans were essential for many, many farmers of all backgrounds to sustain their  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:17):**  farming operations through a few periods of recession and drought and things that were  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:21):**  very hard on the sector.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:23):**  And those loan programs were so deeply discriminatory that actually the largest class action lawsuit  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:30):**  in US history eventually was decided in favor of black farmers who were denied loans, but  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:36):**  not before essentially the vast majority of the black farming population lost their land.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:43):**  So two percent of agricultural land in the US owned by people of color, and it's not  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:47):**  an accident.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:48):**  It's the result of hundreds of years of colonization and then this sort of colonial dynamic that's  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:56):**  never really been taken out of the agricultural economy and the way it functions and the way  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:02):**  it's structured.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:04):**  And you said something seems to be changing or at least there's a different, I would say,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:13):**  smell in the air or something is starting to shift since Black Lives Matter and maybe  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:19):**  also since you've been starting to follow the sector 12 years ago.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:23):**  I don't think land ownership was any real discussion, let's say, beyond a few very niche  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:28):**  circles.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:29):**  Now it seems to be slowly.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:30):**  I mean, soil health is a discussion that's already a surprise.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:34):**  But have you seen shifts like, let's say, four and a half years ago when we last talked,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:38):**  we didn't talk about this topic.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:40):**  Have you seen shifts happening and actual and that's most important, actual land being  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:45):**  shifted because we can talk about a lot, but if no land changes hands, nothing really happens.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:51):**  So have you seen things change there or has it been a lot of talk until now?  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:56):**  I think, you know, the regeneration movement taking on board this issue of racial justice  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:02):**  and land justice, I think that's kind of in its infancy.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:08):**  I think there's a lot more discussion.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:09):**  I think, you know, at, you know, regenerative agriculture events, virtual or in person,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:15):**  you hear a lot more conversation about the need for land justice, racial justice, reckoning  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:22):**  with structural racism.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:24):**  You see a lot more speakers of color, leaders of color being centered in, you know, publications  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:33):**  and journalism around regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:35):**  And at these events, I think there's more of an acknowledgment that, you know, regenerative  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:39):**  agriculture is rooted in the ancestral traditions of communities of color.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:45):**  And yet I don't have a bunch of stories of land transfer in agriculture to share with  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:49):**  you, unfortunately.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:52):**  You know, there's movement on the deeper land back movement in the United States.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:58):**  It's not all agricultural land, but a lot of it is connected to food systems.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:03):**  There's an indigenous woman now who's been appointed in the federal government as the  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:08):**  head of the Department of the Interior and also an indigenous person heading up the national  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:12):**  parks.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:13):**  And we've recently had some high profile transfers of public lands back to native peoples.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:18):**  And in many cases, those are fisheries or lands that are grazed by animals that are  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:25):**  perhaps hunted or, you know, something I wrote about quite a bit in the book is the buffalo  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:29):**  restoration effort that's happening in the prairie led by indigenous people in the United  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:35):**  States.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:36):**  But in terms of, you know, agricultural land more broadly, I think there aren't a lot of  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:43):**  stories about land transfer yet because I think it's going to require pretty ambitious  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:48):**  public policy.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:50):**  And you mentioned, you know, that we have this whole generation of farmers retiring.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:54):**  What I would love to see is a public program that buys those farmers out and then redistributes  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:00):**  that land, you know, cognizant of the inequity that we have now and what needs to be done  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:07):**  to fix it.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:09):**  And how is it for you, obviously a white woman, I mean, you cannot see it on video, but to  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:15):**  write this book, was it uncomfortable?  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:17):**  Was it weird?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:18):**  I'm just asking, like, you visit these bison farms and just quote unquote, it's not really  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:24):**  your tribe.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:25):**  Like, how was that to do that and dig there?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:28):**  You wrote a bit about it in the book and you mentioned at the beginning of the conversation,  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:32):**  I'm not sure if I'm the one that had to tell the story, you did.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:37):**  How was that process for you as an outsider basically to dive into that and write a book  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:44):**  like that?  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:45):**  And how has been the response as well?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:46):**  Two questions, let's start with the first one.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:48):**  Yeah, I struggled for years with whether I should write anything like this.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:55):**  You know, sort of increasingly seeing that regenerative agriculture has this really deep  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:00):**  history in indigenous communities and communities of color.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:03):**  Seeing that-  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:04):**  Yeah, let's just be clear, most or all or most of the practices have been around forever  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:09):**  and were just rediscovered by a white dude somewhere, put in a book and or a podcast  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:15):**  or a series or a course or something.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:17):**  And suddenly there's a great term for that, which I obviously forget.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:20):**  I can imagine how annoying it is for indigenous tribes to see, okay, welcome to the show.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:28):**  You're a few centuries late.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:29):**  We've been doing this forever.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:31):**  And now you put a term on it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:32):**  And it's like, anyway, so it's been around all of it or 99.9% of it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:39):**  So let's not kid ourselves.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:40):**  We're standing on the shoulders of giants without knowing it or without wanting to say  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:43):**  it.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:44):**  So getting that out of the way, how has that been for you?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:47):**  Sorry, you struggled for years, you said.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:49):**  Yeah, I did, because, you know, I'm a narrative writer.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:54):**  And so I was constantly wanting to highlight some of these stories of incredible regenerative  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:01):**  farmers, ranchers from indigenous communities and communities of color, seeing that oftentimes  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:07):**  these individuals in these communities were underrepresented in the media around regenerative  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:11):**  agriculture.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:14):**  And initially, my approach was, that's not the piece, you know, it's not for me to write,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:19):**  but I can, you know, how can I support people from those communities in telling their own  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:24):**  stories?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:25):**  Which I think is the right sort of first step for white people in this space is not to think,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:30):**  how can I do this?  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:32):**  But to think, oh, you know, people are probably already doing this in their own communities,  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:36):**  what can I do to support?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:38):**  And I kind of thought that would be the way in which I thought about being an ally for  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:42):**  the rest of my career as a writer and researcher.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:46):**  But increasingly, I saw that, you know, there was a gap specifically, kind of among white  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:53):**  folks in the research community, that maybe there was a role for me to just be honest  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:00):**  about how I came to seeing this as so important that, you know, my background is that, you  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:07):**  know, my grandmother, white, lost our family farm in the Dust Bowl.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:11):**  And I started this journey just very concerned about how, you know, not taking care of soil  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:17):**  health, you know, ultimately destroys communities.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:22):**  And you know, from that standpoint, as a white person, you know, completely embedded in this,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:29):**  you know, settler colonial history, I see the only hope for my community being in taking  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:35):**  leadership from these indigenous communities and communities of color that have this really  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:39):**  deep relationship with regeneration that's not just these kind of isolated individual  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:44):**  practices, but is embedded in this whole larger philosophy and reciprocal relationship with  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:50):**  land.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:51):**  So I eventually, you know, sort of came to the decision that I just wanted to share from  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:57):**  my standpoint only, not claiming to be, you know, the expert or that this is the definitive  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:02):**  story about regenerative agriculture, but just to say, you know, hey, I'm Liz, you know,  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:08):**  I care deeply about regenerative agriculture from a personal place as well as a professional  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:13):**  place.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:14):**  And, you know, where I've come to after 12 years in this field, is that we really need  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:19):**  to take leadership from indigenous communities and communities of color.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:23):**  And this is where, you know, these techniques originated from.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:27):**  And you know, within these communities, it's not just techniques, it is this deeper relationship  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:32):**  with land.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:34):**  And then it was like, okay, how can I possibly do this in a way that, you know, doesn't produce  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:40):**  more harm than good.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:42):**  And so, you know, from the beginning, I was really committed to not profiting at all from  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:46):**  writing this book.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:48):**  We convened an advisory council of the major folks who are featured in it and made a decision  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:54):**  about where to allocate any of the proceeds.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:58):**  So those are going to a BIPOC farmers land access convergence, and then a really cool  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:06):**  internship with the person featured in the book who works on bison restoration for a  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:12):**  student from a tribal college.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:15):**  And then, you know, I have a page on my website to redirect speaking invitations.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:19):**  I think really carefully about stuff like what we're doing now, podcasts.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:26):**  And you know, in any case where, you know, folks are available and interested, I redirect  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:30):**  those as well to folks in the book or people connected to them.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:35):**  You know, just to make sure that I'm not getting in the way of someone else building their  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:39):**  platform.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:40):**  But, you know, trying to in sort of a humble way and as gracefully as possible to play  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:47):**  this ally role.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:49):**  Because I do think ultimately, you know, everybody has to be part of this transition to a regenerative  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:56):**  agriculture that's also equitable.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:59):**  And so, you know, I think as white people, we shouldn't center ourselves and imagine  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:04):**  we have to continue to be the leaders, you know, because obviously, it's kind of an issue  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:10):**  that we set ourselves a bit too much.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:12):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:13):**  In nature.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:14):**  Ten years ago.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:15):**  No, no, it's it's okay.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:16):**  Sorry.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:17):**  So we don't have to center ourselves.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:20):**  It's a much broader movement.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:22):**  You write about some fascinating stories in the book of not the usual suspects, not the  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:27):**  usual ones that have been doing things that are way beyond, yeah, let's say soil health,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:33):**  and which is which has been very, very interesting.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:35):**  And the book came out in March.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:37):**  And we're now talking June, depending when you listen to this, obviously 2022, by the  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:41):**  way, how's been the response?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah, I never know, people can listen to this like years from now.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:47):**  So I always have to mention what has been the response from, let's say, the traditional  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:54):**  region movement, the non traditional movement, the folks you featured in the book or not?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:00):**  And what has been the how's this book landed, let's say in in this space?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:08):**  You know, I was actually kind of surprised that it's been, it's been really positive,  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:14):**  you know, maybe just to start with, you know, the quote unquote, traditional region movement,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:19):**  I kind of thought I would at some point get a really angry email from somebody, you know,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:23):**  along the lines of, you know, I don't think racial justice has anything to do with this.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:30):**  I haven't gotten that email.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:32):**  Maybe maybe people have said that in each other, you know, in each other's private conversations.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:37):**  Nobody said that to my face.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:39):**  Nobody sent me that email.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:41):**  It probably is because I'm white.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:42):**  I imagine if I were a person of color saying this, I would get some ugly emails.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:46):**  I've heard from colleagues that they have.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:49):**  I also think, you know, Black Lives Matter did a lot of work.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:53):**  I started this book just a few months before George Floyd's murder, you know, not knowing  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:59):**  that there would be a couple years of really public conversation about race happening in  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:06):**  advance of this book coming out.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:08):**  And I think, you know, those activists really kind of paved the way for this conversation  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:13):**  to land and people not to be as shocked by it as they might have five years ago.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:20):**  So I actually got a lot of emails that surprised me in the other direction of folks that I'm  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:26):**  connected to who probably identify as rural conservatives.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:30):**  That's my sense.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:31):**  I've worked with a lot of rural conservatives in the course of my work.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:35):**  You know, I used to be a country singer.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:36):**  I'm from Montana, who wrote me things that were very thoughtful and very empathetic and  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:45):**  ultimately very supportive.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:47):**  And I would have never, ever ventured to have a one on one conversation with some of these  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:52):**  people about race.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:53):**  I would have wrongly assumed that they weren't open to it.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:57):**  And that's the beautiful thing about a book is you can put an idea out there and in a  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:03):**  way you can sort of have an indirect conversation with people and they can sort of find it and  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:08):**  they can sit with it and they can engage you in conversation if they want to.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:13):**  And by and large, I think I've been pleasantly surprised that I think there are people out  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:18):**  there who are ready to talk about race and land justice who maybe wouldn't think are  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:23):**  ready.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:25):**  So I'm going to have a policy going forward of never jumping to the assumption that people  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:31):**  aren't ready for these conversations.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:35):**  And researching this book and spending so much time on the ground, which reading the  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:41):**  stories must have been amazing and painful at the same time.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:44):**  What has been the biggest surprise for you?  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:47):**  Like where are those stories or maybe even a story that didn't make it to the book, but  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:52):**  like something that really, really surprised you could be on anything could be on obviously  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:58):**  that could be on the ground, the plans, the social side, what would have been the biggest  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:03):**  surprise while writing this book?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:06):**  And that got to you?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:08):**  Yeah, I mean, I think so when I started researching the book, and when I got to the point where  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:12):**  I was actually looking for specific people that were going to be kind of like the quote  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:17):**  unquote main characters of the sections, I knew I was looking to feature people of color  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:24):**  and communities of color, because those communities had these long standing pre colonial traditions  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:30):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:32):**  So things like, you know, bison grazing as the as the OG regenerative grazing, you know,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:39):**  agroforestry within the black diaspora, poly culture, all these mixtures of crops in Mesoamerica,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:45):**  deep, deep, deep history, you know, think about three sisters, and nutrient cycling  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:49):**  practices in Asia, which actually, you know, if you sort of trace back, where did the organic  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:54):**  movement get its ideas?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:55):**  Like, Oh, Sir Albert Howard, and an agricultural test went to India, and came back to India.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:02):**  Yeah, Franklin Hiram King, farmers of 40 centuries, he went to China, Japan and Korea.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:07):**  So I was thinking about these pre colonial regenerative traditions.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:12):**  And what I think really surprised me and that I learned in the course of researching the  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:16):**  book, and I have to give a lot of credit to Monica White's book, Freedom Farmers for really  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:21):**  directing my attention in this way, is not only was regenerative agriculture important  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:26):**  prior to colonization, but it's been important within all of these communities as a means  
**[0:43:32-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:32):**  of resistance to colonization.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:34):**  So if you think about colonization as being a kind of mode of extraction, and agriculture,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:41):**  collective agriculture being a part of that colonial logic, communities of color and indigenous  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:47):**  communities have been continually reasserting these regenerative practices to resist that  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:52):**  extraction, which they understand is harmful to their own bodies, their own communities,  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:57):**  their own land.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:58):**  And so those stories were really incredible and surprising to me of, you know, black agro  
**[0:44:03-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:03):**  forestry in the face of enslavement and in the face of Jim Crow, this movement for buffalo  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:11):**  restoration in the face of boarding schools and reservations, all these forms of confinement  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:17):**  that were affecting both people and animals, buffalo restoration being this kind of move  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:22):**  to reclaim this free and mobile relationship with land, which is ecologically necessary  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:29):**  in an arid prairie, but of course, is also, you know, part and parcel of indigenous territorial  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:34):**  sovereignty.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:35):**  So that was really exciting for me in the book when I was like, ah, you know, this is  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:40):**  about regeneration, and it's also about liberation.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:43):**  And those two projects have actually been really closely intertwined within communities  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:48):**  of color for the past few hundred years.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:51):**  And that might be an interesting more understatement, but interesting hook for the current, say,  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:59):**  agriculture system where farmers, regardless of color, are stuck, and are definitely not,  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:05):**  although they inherited the land or leaving the land, questing the site for a second,  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:12):**  but are stuck in a system where they're completely powerless and need a bit of liberation and  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:18):**  need a lot of regeneration as well.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:22):**  And it is a discussion on power.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:23):**  Like, are you dependent on outside forces or do you have your own seeds?  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:26):**  Are you dependent on outside fertility or do you have your own fertility?  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:29):**  Are you dependent on outside labor or do you have year round community on your farm or  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:34):**  nearby that can, the hands you need to work and the hands you want to work on your farm,  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:40):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:41):**  It is a discussion on power and liberation there.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:46):**  So that's a very interesting, like the, most of the agriculture system is stuck because  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:52):**  of that and not because they want to, obviously.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:55):**  And what would you like investors and the finance sector, we are all far away in our  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:01):**  shiny office, and I don't have that, but a shiny office and really not very in touch  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:07):**  with agriculture, at least not, let's say the real version of agriculture, what's really  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:11):**  happening on the land.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:12):**  What would you like to, let's imagine we're doing this in a theater on stage and the room  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:17):**  is full of, let's say enlightened, smart investors and people working in finance.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:21):**  What would you like them to take away to do differently tomorrow or even tonight when  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:25):**  they walk out of that theater and they talk to their neighbor and they're like, what would  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:29):**  you like them to, the main message to take away from your research and also the book?  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:36):**  Well, maybe I'll start with, I think the primary concern that I hear when I talk to people  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:42):**  in the impact investing community who are thinking about regenerative agriculture, I  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:46):**  don't know where this fits on your sort of top 10 of, you know, questions from folks  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:50):**  who are skeptical, but it's really high on mine.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:53):**  And people say, okay, you told me about some techniques that you can verify will put carbon  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:01):**  into the soil, but you haven't told me whether it's going to stay there.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:06):**  How can you prove to me that it's going to-  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:08):**  Permanent.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:10):**  For a period of time relevant to the climate cycle, which is to say a long time.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:16):**  And they look at, you know, the deed on a piece of farmland and they see how many times  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:21):**  it's changed hands in the last hundred years.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:24):**  And they say, is this money just going to evaporate because maybe we did something good  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:30):**  today, but somebody else is on the land in 10 years and that all is gone because, you  
**[0:47:36-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:36):**  know, here comes the plow.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:38):**  Or the carbon destruction machine.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:41):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:43):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:44):**  I'm glad that investors are asking that question.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:47):**  I think that's a very savvy question.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:50):**  And so I would say if you want to make an impactful and effective investment that also  
**[0:47:55-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:55):**  has a long term impact, I would say dig deeper and look at how to invest in projects that  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:02):**  are rooted in indigenous communities and communities of color that have really, really deep ties  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:09):**  to land and for whom regenerative agriculture fits within a larger social and cultural framework,  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:17):**  rather than just as a financial activity or something where people are looking to, you  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:24):**  know, sort of earn a profit or a livelihood within this generation.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:29):**  And I think, you know, obviously the other reason to do this is equity is looking at  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:34):**  that, you know, U.S. statistic that 2 percent of the land is owned, agricultural land is  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:39):**  owned by communities of color and indigenous communities.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:42):**  But it's not just about equity.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:43):**  It is really about impact and effectiveness and why wouldn't you invest in the communities  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:50):**  that have the longest history of having done these things successfully?  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:54):**  I mean, you know, talk about proof of concept.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:57):**  Like Buffalo Prairies did a really good job of storing carbon.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:03):**  And so that's what I would say to the community of investors and funders is do have that lens  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:13):**  of looking at communities of color and indigenous communities.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:16):**  And I'll be the first to acknowledge that in many cases that requires extra homework.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:21):**  You know, I mean, if folks have already been under resourced, they might not have the staff  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:26):**  to have a splashy web page or they might not have sort of configured their project to interface  
**[0:49:33-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:33):**  with the impact investing community as readily as a lot of projects that have been configured  
**[0:49:40-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:40):**  from the beginning to generate that kind of investment.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:43):**  But that's exactly what can make the investment meaningful is that you actually are moving  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:48):**  capital somewhere where it's not already flowing based on prior dynamics.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:53):**  You are actually shifting something and you are actually making a change that's going  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:57):**  to last beyond just, you know, those 10 years of the carbon in the soil.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:02):**  So additionality, the box has been ticked there.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:05):**  And so what would you do if you're in charge of, let's say, a billion or even 10 billion?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:10):**  I have a feeling with inflation, I need to add zeros here.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:13):**  As an investment fund, which has the longest duration you want, like you, it's not confined  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:18):**  to 10 years or eight years or 20 years.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:20):**  It's let's say an evergreen structure.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:23):**  Where would you not where literally, but how would you put it to work?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:26):**  And what would you prioritize?  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:28):**  And if you would be in charge of a significant, significant research portfolio, basically,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:34):**  or a significant portfolio full of resources.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:38):**  So if you're listening to this podcast, and you're actually in that situation, I have  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:42):**  to say I feel for you.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:44):**  Like that's a huge responsibility.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:47):**  That sounds terrifying.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:49):**  And so I think, you know, the most important thing is, is you don't have to figure this  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:53):**  out all yourself.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:55):**  There are some incredible groups and coalitions.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:58):**  I mean, the fact that we're on a podcast here is a great example.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:02):**  But sort of specifically in this space of if you're looking to invest in indigenous  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:06):**  communities and communities of color that have these deep histories of regenerative  
**[0:51:09-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:09):**  agriculture, you know, I would look to groups like the Heal Food Alliance, Soul Fire Farm,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:17):**  the Black Farmer Fund, which I've written about a little bit in the book for some guidance,  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:23):**  you know, and some help kind of navigating this space, because I think it is really tricky,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:27):**  especially if, if you're white, or if your group is white led, you know, sort of adjudicating  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:33):**  claims from different projects led by different people of color, different communities of  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:38):**  color, it can get really uncomfortable really quickly, as you wonder, like, how do I, you  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:45):**  know, sort of direct traffic or referee in this situation?  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:49):**  I know for myself, that often feels really inappropriate, even making decisions about  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:54):**  who to feature in a narrative piece.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:55):**  And so you can lean on groups like Soul Fire Farm, which has a whole network or the Black  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:02):**  Farmer Fund, Northeast Farmers of Color.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:05):**  And a lot of these groups are connected to each other around the world as well.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:08):**  So if you're looking to invest in Europe or the UK or somewhere else, you know, starting  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:14):**  with any of these folks is going to connect you to sort of help you make these decisions  
**[0:52:19-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:19):**  and figure out where where your niche is where you can make the most impact.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:23):**  Yeah, because let's be clear, this is not a US problem or a North American problem only.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:29):**  This is colonization has happened everywhere, almost everywhere has deep, deep traces.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:36):**  And of course, land ownership is an issue everywhere.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:39):**  Access is an issue everywhere.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:40):**  And let's say diversity on the land ownership side is an issue everywhere.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:46):**  And so I mean, the nuances are slightly different in some places, but that we shouldn't just  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:52):**  point out that, oh, that's that's the US.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:53):**  So here we're fine.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:54):**  Or here wherever here is, this is something that is definitely an issue around the world  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:59):**  or a huge issue and a huge lever as well for change.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:03):**  Unless we start talking about the colonization of our food and agriculture and land system  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:09):**  and fisheries, we probably won't get very far.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:13):**  And so what would you then we unfortunately we take your fund away, but you have a magic  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:20):**  wand and listeners of the podcast know this is usually one of the final questions, but  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:25):**  you have a magic wand and you can change one thing in the food and egg space.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:29):**  And realizing I might have asked that last time as well, but I didn't listen.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:32):**  Maybe in episode 18, we didn't have this question yet.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:34):**  And if we have a ping me, because I didn't listen to it before.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:38):**  But if you could change one thing, because for sure, just change over the last four and  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:42):**  a half years that you've been extra active in the space, what would you change if you  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:47):**  could only change one thing in the space?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:50):**  This is greedy.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:51):**  I'm going to give you two answers from everybody that always they like, yeah, one thing, but  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:57):**  I'm going to do things and yeah, that's not the point.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:59):**  Anyway, okay, you get to  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:00):**  from from two of my different personalities.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:03):**  So you know, one side of me, I'm a poet.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:05):**  I'm a former musician, I write narrative books.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:08):**  Another side of me, you know, I worked for a US senator, and I'm a policy wonk.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:13):**  And I think in really precise ways about changing laws.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:18):**  So, so that that side of me the wonk, the one thing I would change is I would change  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:24):**  what happens to people's land when they retire as farmers.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:29):**  And there would be a federal program that offers to buy out those farmers so that they  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:35):**  have a dignified retirement.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:37):**  And there is a pool of land that through public policy, you know, invested in the public interest,  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:44):**  can make that land available to new entry farmers, who may be indigenous who may be  
**[0:54:50-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:50):**  farmers of color.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:51):**  Those folks would have certainly, you know, priority access to make sure that they can  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:56):**  get access to that land who are interested in growing healthy food for their communities  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:00):**  in a way that's consistent with ecological restoration.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:03):**  So that's what I would do on a policy basis.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:06):**  The poet in me says that, you know, any policy change is ultimately based on a change in  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:12):**  our society's relationship to land.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:15):**  And so if I could wave a magic wand and change anything in agriculture, literally, you know,  
**[0:55:22-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:22):**  all those of us on this earth would see land as a relative, as a living, breathing relative.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:31):**  I think there's no better way to to end this this conversation.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:36):**  I want to thank you so much, Liz, to come back on the show for writing this book, for

**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:38):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:42):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:47):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:51):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:52):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:57):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:57:01-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:01):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:06):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:08):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:25):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:26):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:29):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[0:57:44-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:44):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:46):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:49):**  or as private individuals, or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:54):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:59):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:58:00-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:00):**  No.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:01):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:03):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:07):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:58:12-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:12):**  different means.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:13):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:18):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:21):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:23):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides  
**[0:58:29-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:29):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:31):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:36-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:36):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:42):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:58:46-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:46):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:48):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:53):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:57):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:01):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:04):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:07):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:10):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:12):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:18):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

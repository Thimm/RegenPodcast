**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:14):**  And we're live.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:15):**  So welcome to I think the third or the fourth Ask Me Anything webinar.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:20):**  Definitely the first one of this quarter in October, which I cannot imagine this year  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:25):**  just disappeared.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:28):**  But a very interesting time, obviously, for regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:31):**  So I'm so happy to have you all here.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:34):**  And I'm very curious about questions.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:36):**  I hope, as we had last times as well, that the rest of the audience will help to answer  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:43):**  them because obviously I have the great pleasure to interview many people.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:46):**  It doesn't mean I know a lot or everything.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:49):**  People often assume that basically, where can I find funding for that or how do I do  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:54):**  that?  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:55):**  But I just point to the interviews we did because the experts are definitely in this  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:00:59):**  case on the ground.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:00):**  So to start with a short presentation on and I will share my screen, just a bit of background  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:05):**  of where we are, what we're doing and how.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:10):**  So I will open that.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:12):**  And that also means that I cannot allow people in anymore.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:17):**  So that's going to be interesting for a few minutes.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:19):**  So there might be some angry people.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:20):**  Anyway, welcome to the Ask Me Anything webinar of today, the 13th of October.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:25):**  I'm the host of the podcast Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, where they have the  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:29):**  great pleasure to interview anybody from farmers on the ground to fund managers, to large asset  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:34):**  managers, scientists, nutrient density researchers and everything in the middle.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:40):**  If you are not listening, you can definitely find them in your podcast app, basically searching  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:45):**  for Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:47):**  We chose a very inspirational name, but very lucky looking back because it's very easy  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:51):**  to find.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:52):**  There were one of the few if you type that.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:55):**  If you type that, we have done over 100 interviews now in the last four years.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:01:59):**  I think it's October actually.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:01):**  So it's exactly four years ago that I started recording these conversations and I've had  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:05):**  an incredible amount of fun.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:06):**  And of course, luck to you to interview so many interesting people.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:10):**  Always asking that question, how to put money to work, how to get it back and how to regenerate  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:15):**  soils with that money at scale, regenerating people, local communities and ecosystems.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:21):**  And I think we have been on a nice run, especially this year and also last year since it's been  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:25):**  growing the interest and the wave just keeps growing.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:30):**  If you haven't been listening, definitely find us here or on YouTube.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:34):**  We have quite a few interviews on YouTube.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:37):**  But of course, your favorite podcast app, you should be able to find this.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:40):**  The reason we're here or the reason why we decided to do another Ask Me Anything is definitely  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:46):**  around the course.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:47):**  No worries if you haven't looked at it, but we launched a video course on investing in  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:50):**  regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:53):**  Basically you can find it on Gumroad.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:54):**  This is the short link, which is not so easy to remember, but I will also put it in the  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:02:58):**  show notes where we try to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:02):**  What have we learned after interviewing 100, more than 100 people and does more than 100  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:06):**  hours of audio of how to put money to work in this sector.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:10):**  And basically sharing some of the frameworks we've been using on selecting things, etc.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:15):**  Definitely check it out if you're interested.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:17):**  It's pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:19):**  And it's completely found on YouTube and via Gumroad.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:24):**  What is regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:25):**  A lot of people ask that.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:27):**  I wouldn't say constantly, but definitely ask that.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:30):**  And it's a very tricky one because there's not a very good definition.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:35):**  Meaning that this definition I took somewhere from a website.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:38):**  If you put it in and you find it, but it's as my friend, even sort of, you would say,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:43):**  it's more continuum than, Oh, there she goes.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:51):**  It's more continuum than it is a destination.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:55):**  If you talk to a farmer, I don't think he or she will ever say, I'm a regenerative farmer  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:03:59):**  because I'm done with this journey.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:01):**  Now they are applying regenerative practices.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:03):**  And I think that's that distinguishing is extremely important and you can apply a lot  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:07):**  more practices or a lot less.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:10):**  But it doesn't mean that there is a rule.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:12):**  It's not a binary system.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:13):**  You are a regenerative farmer or you're not.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:16):**  What is important to see is the difference between expected, which is most of the farming  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:19):**  we're currently doing, sustainable, which is some of the farming we're doing and regenerative,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:23):**  which is a very small subset of sustainable, but it's definitely focused on regenerating  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:28):**  soils, regenerating sea.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:29):**  Actually you see some examples in oceans as well, and it's going beyond sustainable.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:33):**  How do we repair what has gone, what we have destroyed over the past millennia, in many  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:39):**  cases, 12,000 years.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:41):**  So it's a nice arrow that I definitely took from Ethan.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:44):**  And there's a lot underneath there.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:46):**  He wrote a great article on it, which I will share in the show notes as well, and basically  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:52):**  focus on these different practices of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:55):**  There are many, but they all come down to covering the soil, using complex rotations  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:04:59):**  in place and time, no or very limited tilling.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:02):**  There's a lot of discussion on that and soil disturbing and the integration of animals.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:06):**  And obviously there's a lot of discussion on that as well.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:09):**  But you see that many of these practices, they come from permaculture, they come from  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:13):**  other places and they boil down to three, four, five practices or three, four, I wouldn't  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:19):**  say rules, but definitely if you talk to a farmer applying regenerative practices in  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:23):**  Costa Rica or in the Netherlands, they will come down to these things.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:26):**  This is a very, very busy slide.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:29):**  Don't try to read it, but definitely have a look at the article of Ethan.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:33):**  He wrote in 2011, so almost 10 years ago, where he basically, this is a very nice map  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:38):**  you can use.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:39):**  You can send to somebody, to a farmer and ask them, where do you stand on these different  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:42):**  things?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:43):**  For instance, fuel, for instance, the source of inputs, for instance, your economic sustainability,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:48):**  for instance, your tillage.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:49):**  And it would vary quite a bit.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:52):**  And also the second question, where would you like to go?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:54):**  So I would like to use this actually, we're going to use this more on the podcast as well.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:05:58):**  So if you want to learn more, look at the article, read some books.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:02):**  David Montgomery has a great book.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:03):**  Kiss the Ground has a Netflix movie out now.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:05):**  You probably have seen it, or at least some discussion around it.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:09):**  The book is great as well.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:10):**  Dirt to Soil is a very interesting one.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:12):**  Richard Perkins on YouTube is a great small scale farmer.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:15):**  And there's actually a lot more.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:17):**  Judith Schwartz just has a new book out, which I still have to read.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:20):**  But have a look there and basically dive deeper.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:22):**  And obviously, if you want to follow the podcast, feel free as well.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:27):**  And with that, I'm going to stop sharing my screen, see how many people we have in the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:33):**  waiting room.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:34):**  So with that, just a short introduction into the world of regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:38):**  food, which is exploding.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:39):**  You see a lot of large companies coming into the space, which is always interesting.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:45):**  Very scary for many, I think in the space as well, and very necessary from another side.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:49):**  I'm just going to bring in the two questions.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:51):**  And we actually have the two people, I think, even in the room if they want to ask them.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:56):**  So I'm first going to bring up Joe Swart.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:06:59):**  If you're able to talk, you want to ask your question live or shall I put it in the chat  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:04):**  anyway?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:05):**  I will definitely share the slides.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah, I will share the slides afterwards.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:09):**  They're always the same, actually.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:11):**  And it doesn't change too much in the different asking anything ones.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:15):**  But anyway, Joe, I'll put your question in the chat.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:19):**  And if you want to unmute, you can also ask it live.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:24):**  So we are setting up a regenerative agri hub now in Kenya, bringing together at the moment,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:31):**  we starting it off with three leading farmers.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:36):**  But we have about 30 farmers waiting in the wings.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:38):**  And it's the first agri hub of a whole chain is one plant for Mozambique, and so on and  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:43):**  so forth.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:45):**  So it's all about the agglomerating product, and also to shift the whole process of production  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:54):**  towards regenerative stuff.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:07:58):**  What advice could you give or kind of insight could you give on just the investment strategy?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:06):**  What have you learned and what are the kind of common pitfalls?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:11):**  Thank you.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:12):**  Thank you for the question.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:13):**  It's a very broad one.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:14):**  And the city answer it's, it depends.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:18):**  In this case, it sounds like it's not a land based investment in this case, more a food  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:23):**  company or processing based.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:25):**  There are definitely investors out there that have been financing this, for instance, in  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:29):**  the coffee space and the chocolate space or the bean space to bring or to leave some of  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:34):**  this added value in the country of origin where this is processed.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:39):**  I know that some other investors are starting to look at it.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:43):**  It's not an easy one.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:45):**  But I would definitely look, I wouldn't say the investors that are purely focused on region  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:50):**  practices because they're not so many that are comfortable with processing or even comfortable  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:55):**  with investing in Kenya.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:08:57):**  I would look more at the impact investing space in Kenya and definitely add obviously  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:02):**  to regenerative practices to the deck and to the pitch, but mostly pitch it as an interesting  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:08):**  processing investment, an interesting added value investment that more of the money stays  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:11):**  locally.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:13):**  I know for instance, a very well known impact investor Goodwill, and that's Vincent for  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:18):**  sure knows, is up to their third fund now, mostly technology, has done a lot of MFI's  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:24):**  like microfinance and a lot of FinTech and have recently made their first agriculture  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:29):**  investment in Nigeria, actually a tomato processing plant because Nigeria is one of the biggest  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:35):**  tomato producers in Africa and also one of the biggest importers of tomato products.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:40):**  So they invested in a company that is making tomato products in Nigeria and does replacing  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:46):**  import.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:47):**  So I would start seeing that some of these investors start to look at agriculture and  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:51):**  food, but I also know from inside there that it was a very long process to get these FinTech  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:09:56):**  investors and to get the company comfortable with each other and actually make that investment.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:01):**  I think it took way longer than they normally would take, but they are very happy about  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:05):**  their first food and agriculture investments.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:06):**  I would look more at the impact investment space, the funds that are active in East Africa  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:11):**  and that are maybe comfortable already with some agriculture and are interested in that.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:16):**  And the region part I think is in this case a nice add on, but I think it would find a  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:20):**  very hard time finding an investor that is comfortable with processing, comfortable with  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:25):**  in this case Nairobi and comfortable with the region part or that specifically looking  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:30):**  for that because I wouldn't know anybody immediately.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:33):**  Although many of these impact funds I know are starting to be more conscious about soil,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:38):**  but it's a journey and many are not there yet I would say.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:43):**  So it's probably not a very easy answer.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:46):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:47):**  You're quite right.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:50):**  And then we have another question from Marlise, which is a very, very deep question, which  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:10:56):**  you can spend quite a bit of time on, but I will put it in the chat if I get the right.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:02):**  But you can also ask it or basically I think it's about land ownership, but if you want  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:09):**  to elaborate a bit on it, Marlise, then please go.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:12):**  I will elaborate.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:14):**  I'm not sure if people are familiar with the one, two, three business model.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:20):**  You've had lots of interviews with them on the podcast and last time with the Ask Me  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:27):**  Anything I saw people from one, two, three, it's an organization and they do wonderful  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:32):**  stuff where they go and buy a degraded plantation.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:40):**  It's one of their business models, but I'm going to focus on this specific example where  
**[0:11:45-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:45):**  they have funds of an investor and they buy a degraded land in South America of a plantation  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:54):**  and regenerate it to life.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:11:58):**  And then the plantation is seen as the nucleus.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:01):**  So it's a healthy plantation.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:02):**  They employ local people and then the surrounding economy also benefits obviously because they  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:07):**  need nurseries and seedlings and there's jobs.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:14):**  So my question is twofold.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:16):**  When I looked at the business model, I thought it was very interesting and that it was a  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:20):**  for profit plantation.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:26):**  And then I thought two things.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:27):**  Well, it's money from outside.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:29):**  They go in, they buy a piece of land.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:32):**  Yes, they provide employment, but then they have a profitable company and they sell it  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:38):**  to well, not the local community because they can't buy it, but to another big one percenter.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:44):**  So my question was, how do they see the local community actually benefit from it?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:49):**  And then this is not my question, but it's the follow up is I'm working with a pilot  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:12:56):**  program of smallholder farmers to convert them in South America, to convert them to  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:01):**  agroforestry.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:03):**  So I don't want to ask them obviously to sell their land, but I was thinking if we have  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:09):**  this pilot of like hundred farmers and I don't know how many hectares, say 2000 hectares,  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:15):**  would it then be a good thing or a bad thing to have a one, two, three plantation in the  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:21):**  region?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:22):**  Would it be competing with the smallholder farmers because they lack the scale or would  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:25):**  it actually beneficial because of the big plantation in the neighborhood it will draw?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:31):**  I don't know, you will have a bigger market or yeah, I'm trying to figure out if it makes  
**[0:13:36-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:36):**  sense to have a big plantation there for the surrounding community and how do they see  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:45):**  it in the long run that the plantation itself actually benefits the local community?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:52):**  It's a very, very good question.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:13:54):**  I think it touches upon a big elephant in the room in many of the, I wouldn't say the  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:00):**  earlier models, maybe I mentioned that in the course, but the models of buying land,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:04):**  regenerating it and selling it because you improve the quality.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:08):**  In this case, it's a shame that Lenny isn't one of the employees of one, two, three who  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:13):**  signed up, but he's not on the call, but I can definitely ask what they think of that.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:19):**  But the ownership structure is absolutely crucial.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:22):**  Like who owns the land, why can somebody from outside come in, buy, regenerate and sell  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:29):**  and obviously profit from that.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:31):**  And in this case, there are big German pension funds.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:34):**  And I think the answer lies in what happens at the sale and what happens there and in  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:43):**  what kind of, in this case, in the land buying funds and structures, what happens after.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:50):**  In some cases they're setting up, they have 10 years and that's the traditional way of  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:55):**  doing many of these things, but many others are starting to look at evergreen structures  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:14:58):**  so they never sell or they are actually, the profits are based on basically what comes  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:03):**  off the land.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:04):**  And obviously that could be slightly less and you still benefit from sort of internal  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:09):**  metric that your land is increasing in price, but you're not selling.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:13):**  And we've had a number of discussions on this actually on the podcast, twice with Thomas  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:17):**  Ripple who is in Germany, very active of basically buying land and getting it off the market  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:21):**  and never selling it again.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:23):**  It will be hauled by a foundation and basically it cannot be speculatively used anymore.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:29):**  In the Netherlands, Heeren Boren is very busy with that and buying farms and farmland and  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:34):**  getting it off the market.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:36):**  In the US, it's a huge problem because of transition of generations.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:39):**  A lot of farmers are old, like actually in Europe as well.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:42):**  And if they sell to a speculator, then obviously the pressure on the next generation that comes  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:47):**  on the farm is enormous because they have to pay back this enormous fee that they have  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:51):**  to borrow somewhere from a bank, et cetera.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:53):**  So it's an enormous question on land ownership.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:56):**  What do we find fair or not?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:15:59):**  The first wave of these structures are buying it and selling it at some point farmland LP.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:04):**  I mean, there are a number of these and I think they're essential for the sector because  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:09):**  we get to a certain scale that we can start doing agroforestry at thousands and thousands  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:13):**  of hectares.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:14):**  But I don't think it's the optimal model.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:16):**  I'm very interested in this case in transition finance.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:19):**  Like, how do you partner with current landowners and help them through the transition or investing  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:25):**  in their transition?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:26):**  But even there, there's a big question on how do they actually get ownership of that  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:29):**  land?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:30):**  Shouldn't it be hold by collectives?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:31):**  Shouldn't it be hold by the common good?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:34):**  And there, we as society, we have a very big question to answer.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:38):**  Why can somebody own land and why can somebody else only rent it?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:43):**  And that's something we have to figure out.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:46):**  I don't know the answer to your second question.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:47):**  Is it good to have a big plantation or not?  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:51):**  Run by one, two, three that hopefully is going to be as regenerative as possible.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:16:55):**  A lot of these structures function as a sort of hub and spokes, meaning they set up a demonstration  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:02):**  site obviously quite big in many cases, but they work with local farmers as well and try  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:06):**  to incorporate their cacao, et cetera, to increase the quality and basically get to  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:12):**  a bigger scale.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:13):**  But it's a very, it's a tension.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:14):**  It's a tension between coming in from outside with a lot of money and because one, two,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:18):**  three raised a lot of money and put a lot of money to work.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:21):**  And at the same time, buying very, very degraded plantations that have been run down by previous  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:26):**  owners and come back to life, which is a good thing, but could it be better or not?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:32):**  That's the question.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:33):**  It's not an easy one.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:34):**  And then ownership will run through the regenerative space for as long as we haven't figured out  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:39):**  what to do there.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:40):**  Because many of land has been stolen, has been taken, has been contracts forced.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:45):**  If you go into the history of land ownership, it's not a pretty one.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:48):**  And we're going to find a lot of, especially indigenous peoples that have been moved off  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:53):**  the land, off their lands, and they've managed for centuries and for millennia, and somebody  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:17:57):**  came in, got a contract and took it.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:00):**  So it's very, very, very difficult, especially if a lot of money comes from outside.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:05):**  Even if you try to do it the most sustainable, regenerative, socially acceptable possible,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:11):**  you're still probably stepping on toes and probably a discussion needs to be held there.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:18):**  Thank you.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:19):**  From what I'm gathering now is I'm just going to look at and cherry pick like, okay, so  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:23):**  they're doing a regenerative farm and they're making a lot of money.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:27):**  Let's do that with our farmers.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:29):**  I think that the good thing is they, I mean, to regenerate large pieces of land, we need  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:35):**  money.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:36):**  And if you are able to raise that from pension funds, first of all, the money doesn't, didn't  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:41):**  go anywhere else being put to work to plant, hopefully as regenerative system as much as  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:47):**  possible, but you don't get away from the ownership structure discussion.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:51):**  At some point it comes up and you have to deal with it.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:18:55):**  I see some, obviously some answers in the chat as well, which is great.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:00):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:01):**  And I would definitely put all of these in the show notes as well.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:08):**  Can you put a link to the plantation purchasing organization that you mentioned?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:13):**  I think it's one, two, three Martha, but not sure.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:16):**  Let me know if that is.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:19):**  So thank you, Jeffrey, for putting it, putting it in.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:22):**  We interviewed Olivier, who is the COO and Richard was the founder, Richard Fokken, relatively  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:29):**  recent and they raised quite a bit of money from German pension funds and have been on  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:35):**  an investment spree.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:37):**  So I want to open it up to other questions.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:40):**  We have an open field, so please, so please either put them in the chat and or unmute  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:50):**  yourself if you're the first, otherwise it's going to be a bit of a chaos.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:54):**  There we go.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:55):**  Philip, you're the first.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:56):**  I could see you.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:57):**  Hi, Koen.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:19:58):**  Thanks a lot for the show.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:02):**  Very specific question is what's the economic incentive for a farmer to transition to regenerative?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:10):**  I listen to all your podcasts on the transition.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:15):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:16):**  However, there's a lot of questions.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:21):**  The way I see it is that when a farmer starts a transition to regenerative, probably they're  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:27):**  going to have to sacrifice productivity.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:31):**  They're going to have a lower yield in the production.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:36):**  So that would be a negative.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:39):**  And a lot of people, even in the going to get certified organic has that problem because  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:45):**  you have three years of calculated three years to become certified.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:50):**  And at the same time, you're sacrificing yields.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:20:54):**  So anyway, the only way I see that the farmer can get an economic benefit from that is that  
**[0:21:05-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:05):**  we help them be able to sell their produce directly to the consumer.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:14):**  Do you have a specific crop in mind in this case, your question, or is it a general one?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:23):**  Just general.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:25):**  That's the only way I see that they can get an economic advantage, which can counter the  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:34):**  lower productivity they're going to have for some years before the regenerative benefits  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:39):**  kick in.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:43):**  Take out the middle man.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:45):**  I think that's a good thing in general.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:46):**  But I mean, it depends a bit.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:48):**  If you look at a grain farmer like Benedict, who we did the transition finance series with,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:21:56):**  selling directly for him would be very difficult because you don't go with a few tons of grain  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:01):**  to a farmers market.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:03):**  I think in terms of return or in terms of financial incentives, it really depends where  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:09):**  you look.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:11):**  If you look at, for instance, almond crops or certain grain crops, the incentive is absolutely  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:17):**  there to apply more regenerative practices.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:20):**  If you look at, for instance, the gap in price between non-organic grains and organic grains  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:26):**  in the US, for instance, where there's a huge shortage, it definitely makes sense to transition.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:31):**  It takes a number of years.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:32):**  So you need finance or it depends on your bank account, but many need finance to get  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:36):**  through those three years.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:37):**  Obviously, it depends how your land is treated.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:39):**  If you have already been very selective with spraying and doing a lot of conventional but  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:47):**  very specific agriculture practices, maybe your lag time is less.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:51):**  In many cases, there is a yield gap and the J curve goes down.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:55):**  The question is how far and how deep, and that really depends on the land.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:22:58):**  So that's very difficult to say.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:00):**  If the land has been severely degraded, it could take five to 10 years.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:03):**  If the land has been in an OK state, it could take a few years.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:07):**  What we now see is that for many farmers, it's a combination of things.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:13):**  It's definitely the input costs which are rising and the yields which are slowly going  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:18):**  down in many places or actually faster going down.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:21):**  So it's sort of a necessity if those two lines didn't already meet, they might meet in two  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:26):**  or three or five years.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:27):**  And it's a necessity to start changing and especially on the input side to reduce those  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:33):**  costs.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:34):**  So if you look now at, again, grain, for example, Elmonds, Jonathan Lintgen just published a  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:39):**  study or is publishing a study and is doing the webinar, I think next week, on Elmonds  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:44):**  systems in the US and how much more profitable farmers are that are using regenerative practices.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:49):**  He did the same on grain a few years ago, 2018, which is one of the few studies looking  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:23:54):**  at profitability and saw that they greatly outperformed the non-regenerative practices  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:00):**  using farmers and also had way less pests, et cetera.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:03):**  So really, I think it's a game around inputs, costs and obviously getting higher prices  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:08):**  for, if you can, getting higher prices for your produce.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:11):**  And in this case, I see funds being set up in the US that are specifically looking at  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:16):**  grain.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:17):**  Why?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:18):**  Because they're subject, so they buy conventional land.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:19):**  They help that land through the three years of transition to organic.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:22):**  The prices of organic of grain are somewhere between 100 or 200% compared to the conventional  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:28):**  one.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:29):**  And they are seeing that with very advanced regenerative practices, they can get to the  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:32):**  same yield.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:33):**  They can close the yield gap between conventional and organic, meaning you get more or less  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:38):**  the same yield.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:39):**  In drought years, you get much better yield than your non-organic neighbors, and you get  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:44):**  a much better price.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:45):**  And your input costs are also lower.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:47):**  Your manual might be more.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:48):**  You might have some other extra costs.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:50):**  But from, let's say, an economic perspective, certain crops are definitely already there  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:55):**  in terms of the gap.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:24:56):**  But it's really, you have to search, you have to find, it could be that certain grain crops  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:00):**  are in certain places are not yet there.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:02):**  But if you can get good off-take agreements, which was the conclusion of the transition  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:06):**  finance series.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:07):**  Transition finance is great.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:08):**  But more important is to get good off-take agreements, even long-term off-take agreements,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:14):**  to actually get some security in those years where you're applying more cover crops, where  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:18):**  you're really going all in with regenerative practices.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:22):**  Because there might be some shocks, and the margins are so thin that it's very difficult.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:26):**  So Benedict is working on that.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:28):**  I hope to be able to share some updates soon.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:31):**  And then it's much easier to get transition finance.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:33):**  But you see, for instance, in organic, the Rabobank in the US is experimenting with organic  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:38):**  loans to help farmers through those three years.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:41):**  Why?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:42):**  Because they have more costs.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:43):**  They have less.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:44):**  They don't have the premium yet, but their soil is in shock.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:47):**  So there's a very interesting investment case to close that gap or to bridge that gap.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:52):**  But it's going to be specific on crops because almonds are very different compared to olives,  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:25:56):**  very different compared to grapes, very different compared to grain, and very different compared  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:00):**  to potatoes.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:03):**  I see some answers also, or some people.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:05):**  Thank you, Amin, to answer that.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:09):**  I will probably put the interview with Jonathan Lündchen, where we talked about profitability  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:14):**  in the show notes.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:17):**  And I have the link of the webinar somewhere where he's presenting a new study they did  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:22):**  on almonds to see the profitability difference between regenerative ones.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:27):**  And they basically looked at the neighbors.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:29):**  So they had the same soil type, the same climate, everything the same, except their practices  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:34):**  to see what was the profitability or what is the profitability difference.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:37):**  And it is quite large.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:39):**  At least I've seen the announcement.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:40):**  I haven't read the report yet.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:43):**  I hope that helps, Philippe.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:48):**  I see impact bonds.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:50):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:51):**  This is a bond-like question.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:52):**  Like, if you know that in three, four, five years, you'll be or your yield will be comparable  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:26:57):**  or at least very close to, and you can get access to a much more interesting market.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:01):**  In this case, the organic market in many places is very interesting.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:04):**  That is a finance question.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:06):**  Can you help a large group of farmers through that transition?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:09):**  That's what Pipeline Foods is doing in the US.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:11):**  That's what players start to do because it's such a, I think it's 1% of the US farmland  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:16):**  is certified organic.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:18):**  More than 6% of the sales is organic, which means there's a lot of import.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:22):**  And so there's a huge gap there to start supplying more.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:25):**  In many countries, that's the case.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:28):**  It comes down to a finance question and obviously an operational question as well.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:34):**  Who's next with a question?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:36):**  You can type it.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:37):**  You can unmute if you're quick enough.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:47):**  Just going back to your, what you were saying, but the transition.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:51):**  A lot of the farmers there won't transition straight away because they haven't got finances  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:55):**  behind them.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:56):**  And that's a big thing.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:27:58):**  And a lot of people will stagger that transition over five years.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:02):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:04):**  Which is that shock that's going to affect it.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:08):**  Definitely.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:09):**  I think I wouldn't want to argue that anybody should take finance if you can do it slowly  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:16):**  and more secure.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:18):**  Probably don't shock the system too much because you might be in for a surprise.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:24):**  Many of the first generation, almost farmers using regenerative practices, they've been  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:29):**  forced to because they lost their corporate number of times or they reached the end of  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:33):**  their bank account and they couldn't buy inputs anymore.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:36):**  I wouldn't suggest that that's the best case.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:39):**  We know the stories and it's great that they did, but they also, they could have also tipped  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:43):**  over and basically lost the farm.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:45):**  So I would definitely, I mean, cautious and context specific transition is key.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:50):**  And hopefully in the future, many farmers obviously get their finance through local  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:54):**  banks.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:28:55):**  And what we really hope with climate bonds and green bonds is that local banks can raise  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:00):**  capital, cheaper capital, if you are applying a regenerative practices.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:05):**  Like if as a farmer that your interest rate or your payments are different, if you are  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:09):**  applying regenerative practices.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:11):**  And that would be very, very interesting.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:13):**  They just raised the first green bond and the climate bonds initiative, certified green  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:18):**  bond in foreign agriculture company in Brazil, Rizoma, which we interviewed and which was  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:23):**  greatly oversubscribed 25 million to apply these practices.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:27):**  So it is happening.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:28):**  The market is starting to move, but these are still very small, like very small incidents  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:35):**  almost in the space where you see this happening.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:37):**  And many farmers have to do it unfortunately by themselves because their local bank doesn't  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:41):**  know what they're talking about if they say soil practices.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:44):**  Most commercial banks won't even look at them.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:47):**  But I need.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:48):**  No, no.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:49):**  They already, I mean, already organic is for many, like way too difficult.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:54):**  And it's unfortunate, but there's going to be a huge role for banks here.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:56):**  I don't have no doubt.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:58):**  Okay.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:29:59):**  Can I ask something?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:02):**  Yeah, we had Robert first who raised his hand because he figured out the system in Zoom  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:07):**  to raise your hand, which is great.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:08):**  Then I'll go to you, Ben.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:10):**  Robert, please go ahead.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:11):**  You have to unmute.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:12):**  We cannot hear you.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:13):**  We cannot hear you still, Robert.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:14):**  There we are.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:16):**  Okay.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:17):**  Sorry about that.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:18):**  Thanks for this.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:19):**  I'm in the process of setting up a feasibility study in southwest Uganda to build a processing  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:35):**  centre for coffee, which is a very high grade there, but they've no processing facilities.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:41):**  And then I want to start this as a centre of excellence.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:45):**  And I've been, I've visited the area, I've looked at the farming and stuff, and I think  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:52):**  there's a possibility of improving their yields in many ways, not just from the coffee, but  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:30:58):**  actually from growing other crops in between the coffee trees.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:02):**  These are all small farmers, usually around one to two hectares.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:07):**  There's 3,200 of them.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:09):**  They're in a co-op.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:11):**  And this is money, pin money for them to stop them actually going into the rainforest to  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:17):**  hunt for food.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:20):**  So this is very important in terms of protecting the gorillas in the area.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:24):**  But I'm just wondering if anybody here, or you might have some advice as to what type  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:29):**  of crops, you know, I'm thinking garlic.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:31):**  I'm thinking herbs and medicinal herbs and spices that could be good cash crops that  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:37):**  would grow in between the coffee trees in this highland area that's rich in volcanic  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:43):**  soil.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:44):**  So that's a bit of a mouthful.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:46):**  Very specific.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:47):**  Anybody who knows any funding structures, I mean, applied to the Irish government's  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:53):**  AADP, which is, you know, for a grant, which is pending at the moment.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:31:59):**  Obviously there's other countries that we can link with in this type of thing.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:02):**  Other EU countries that have similar foreign affairs grants.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:06):**  Happy to talk about that and link with people to do great projects with other people in  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:13):**  other countries like I hear somebody from Kenya on this call.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:16):**  It would be nice to connect afterwards.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:19):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:20):**  I think to unpack the two questions, to start with the second one, I would definitely look  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:27):**  to make it easier financeable, we come back to something we've discussed before is to  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:32):**  get good offtake agreements.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:34):**  Meaning get the bean to bar or the coffee place, the bean to cup movement.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:41):**  And there are actually buyers now that start to ask for higher quality and higher quantity  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:45):**  as well.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:47):**  But get a better price for, and that actually also answered the question somebody asked  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:50):**  in the chat.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:52):**  What's a good approach and argument to persuade farmers is to pay for quality and that could  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:32:58):**  mean very different things in very different regions or crops.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:01):**  In this case, coffee, there is a market not as easily accessible as we want to sometimes,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:06):**  but there's definitely a market for higher quality.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:09):**  And so that would make everything a lot easier.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:13):**  Obviously, if there are interesting offtake agreements there, or at least interest, et  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:17):**  cetera.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:18):**  So if you have companion crops or cash crops, I would ask to the experts like Preta Terra  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:23):**  or ReNature, the ones that are building this, a central public our forestry systems around  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:28):**  the world, like what makes sense where and why.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:31):**  And in this case, it's a super complex specific question that I really don't know if garlic  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:34):**  makes sense or not.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:35):**  So I wouldn't go there, but there are people out there that are building these systems  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:39):**  and very complex, but also focus on cash crops and companion crops and crops that make sense  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:45):**  together, both because of the soil, but also because of the local context of what is sellable  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:50):**  and what obviously builds more resilience in the system.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:33:54):**  So I would look for the right consultants there that can help with those systems.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:01):**  And then we go to Feni.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:06):**  If anybody else, please put in the chat if you have any suggestions for Robert.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:11):**  Yes, thanks.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:14):**  So I'm in the beginning at the beginning of my journey to build a solution for transitioning  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:23):**  farmers to reach an egg.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:25):**  And I'm wondering, I mean, a lot is happening, of course, already.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:29):**  So in my exploration, I'm wondering if you have an idea, you guys, what kind of solutions  
**[0:34:39-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:39):**  do we need or need more of to transition farmers really at scale?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:49):**  We can spend a few hours on that, Feni.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:54):**  Thinking about what we focus on in the podcast, I think that's the best answer I can give  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:34:58):**  at least is our two main or three main things.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:04):**  One is definitely nutrient density.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:06):**  So it comes back to the quality discussion.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:08):**  Then we show that connection between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut system  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:12):**  and healthy people and that's healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:15):**  And that would probably get away of a whole superfood discussion.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:19):**  But there is a discussion that we can have on food as medicine.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:23):**  And I think there's a lot to discover there.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:25):**  A lot of very ugly things like we did with Zach Bush, but a lot of very interesting things  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:29):**  if we start looking at food as much more than just fuel.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:33):**  And there are some very interesting research pieces and very practical research, which  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:37):**  actually your farmers coming out that this carrot is not the same as that carrot.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:41):**  The organic carrots you find in the supermarket or one actually grown in very healthy soil  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:46):**  are not the same thing.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:47):**  They might look the same.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:48):**  They might have the same color.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:50):**  But if you look under the hood, if you look what they actually have, and I think that  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:54):**  could unlock a huge amount of consumer demand.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:35:57):**  If we start to actually treat food as medicine, we're not there yet.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:01):**  We still need a lot of moving parts.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:04):**  But as one of the big funders in this space said to me not so long ago that we're literally  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:09):**  in terms of diet, in terms of understanding what food does to us and what the connection  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:13):**  is to soil and us, we're in the stone age.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:16):**  We have very, very, very little understanding.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:19):**  You just have to open a diet book to see how far we are from truly understanding that system  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:24):**  and truly understanding our gut system honestly.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:26):**  So that's definitely a huge piece.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:28):**  Like that could unlock so much, maybe not in the coffee space, maybe not in some certain  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:32):**  specific places, but I think if we start seeing what's actually healthy for us and what's  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:37):**  not, that could help.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:40):**  Second piece is landscape size.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:42):**  How do we get this discussion from a farm to farm level to a full ecosystem, a watershed?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:48):**  How do we scale it in terms of hectares and acres a lot more?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:52):**  What kind of technology do we need for that to figure out what to plant, where and why?  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:56):**  It's something I hope to do a series on next year.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:36:59):**  I just keep saying it, so hopefully it happens to really dive deep into that question.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:04):**  Commonland is releasing a big piece with KPMG, I think in a week or two, no, in a week actually,  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:11):**  and on the returns on a landscape size restoration project in Spain.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:14):**  So there's a lot happening there, but still there's not enough discussion, not enough  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:18):**  doing.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:19):**  Like we need to get this to an island scale, to a river system scale, to a watershed, to  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:23):**  an ecosystem because farm by farm, we're just simply not getting the network effects we  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:27):**  need.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:28):**  And then ecosystem payments for farmers, like how do we pay farmers, not just for the food,  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:34):**  but for the other services, which is very difficult, not easy, a lot of moving parts,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:38):**  but a lot happening as well, especially now around carbon.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:41):**  And then the fourth theme we at least focus on is transition finance to finance the above  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:45):**  three.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:46):**  And that's what we try, really, really try to keep it to, but it's not easy because there's  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:50):**  so much happening in this space.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:52):**  So I hope that sort of answers.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:53):**  We go deeper into that also in the course of this.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah, great.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:58):**  Thanks.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:37:59):**  And we try to answer the question by what's fast, like what in the next 15 years can really  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:05):**  tip the scale and why now?  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:08):**  Because many other things obviously need to happen around land ownership, et cetera, that  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:11):**  we've discussed as well, but they're much slower processes.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:14):**  So we decide to include it sometimes, but not fully focused on that.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:19):**  I see a lot of questions in the chat, which I will get to, and I see Joram as well waving.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:22):**  So we go to Joram first and then I'll go to the chat.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:25):**  Good.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:26):**  So we'll get to the discussion and answers.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:30):**  As you know, I'm very much interested in how we're able to create the measurement, what  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:35):**  tools there are today for measurement verification, but create transparency.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:39):**  We speak about so many stakeholders now, the finance and customers and brands and so on.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:47):**  What measures there is today and how can we create transparency, which I think will eventually  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:52):**  will actually help to scale connected to the previous question, we're able to do it.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:38:57):**  Obviously consumer aiming for more healthy products and so on, but there's a big show  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:04):**  of transparency and there's an issue of credibility today or certification scheme and all of that  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:10):**  that we see on the ground.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:11):**  So interested very much on this area.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:14):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:15):**  I'm scheduled to do an update interview tomorrow.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:19):**  I scheduled it, so let's hope it happens tomorrow with Greg Schumacher of Teak Origin who is  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:26):**  definitely on the transparency side, quite, let's say forward thinking and advanced.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:31):**  And they do a lot of this research in supermarkets, like what's actually in your food, in your  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:35):**  grapes, in your tomatoes, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:38):**  So I'm very much looking forward to checking with him on that, like what has happened since  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:41):**  the last time we talked, which has been a year, I think a year plus, and he's been by  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:46):**  far the most listened episode we ever made.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:49):**  I'm also scheduled to do one with Ben Kittrich, the founder of the Biomutrient Food Association,  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:55):**  who really looks at that soil connection as well and has made a device, which I don't  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:39:59):**  have here, but I bought it, to basically measure the nutrient density of food.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:04):**  The big thing missing there is the context.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:06):**  Like I can measure tomato, which is great.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:08):**  I can do an apple, but if I don't know, I mean, I get a number of numbers, but if I  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:13):**  don't know the context, what these numbers actually mean and how an apple could be or  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:17):**  should be, or this type of apple, then we sort of get lost in the numbers.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:21):**  So we are really at that stone age phase, but I hope in the next months to do at least  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:26):**  to get from some of the people working at the absolute cutting edge of this field to  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:31):**  get an update where we are, what's missing, and how many years are we from measuring this  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:36):**  stuff in the supermarket or actually getting a label and seeing, because if you look at  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:40):**  an, like look at a label and it says tomato, it could mean anything.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:45):**  It could be organic, which obviously has to be certified there, but it doesn't say anything  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:50):**  about the nutrient density and we're really early there, but that transparency is going  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:55):**  to be revolutionary.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:40:56):**  Like it would, I wouldn't say change the food sector overnight, but it would be a huge shift  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:01):**  if we start discussing quality per hectare or quantity of nutrients and start looking  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:06):**  at what do you need versus what do I need because we have a different gut system and  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:10):**  personalized medicine, which a lot of people talk about, but they never talk about the  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:15):**  food side of things, is going to be very interesting and local become very interesting because  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:18):**  maybe your gut flora mimics the flora of the soil nearby and thus you're much more able  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:24):**  to absorb certain things or not and seasonal, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:28):**  It's one of the topics I need to dive deeper into and the short answer is we're not there  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:33):**  yet, but we're coming.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:34):**  And if I may say you're looking on the olive gray, which is the end consumer, but maybe  
**[0:41:38-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:38):**  the driver of initially would be the government subsidiary or financial programs of the bank  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:46):**  and spoke about the quality of the land that is improving and so on.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:50):**  Maybe there would be consumer next time.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:54):**  I think food companies, I, my guess is that they're going to be food as medicine companies,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:41:58):**  very hip, maybe at the beginning, very super food focused, but actually with quality of  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:04):**  data underneath that, that are going to dive into that and show maybe baby food brand.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:10):**  I interviewed one recently that are only using by dynamic products for partly that reason.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:15):**  They might not be able to show it yet and measure it yet, but they have made that choice  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:19):**  and they see different nutrients and they see different things and they, they promoted  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:24):**  as that.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:25):**  And maybe new parents are the first to jump on this or maybe athletes or maybe people  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:31):**  at risk.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:32):**  We're, we're obviously talking about healthcare a lot these days.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:34):**  So I would look there at some niches and maybe people that are in the hospital and with certain,  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:39):**  I mean, they did some research in the Netherlands actually, I think in the North where they  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:43):**  saw that people, they don't know why, but getting local food in the hospitals was shortening  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:47):**  their hospital days, which is very interesting from an insurance perspective.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:51):**  Those things look for those smaller examples and smaller studies.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:54):**  And that might be the beginning of this piece.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:42:58):**  I see that Jeffrey had a, has a question.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:00):**  Go ahead, Jeffrey.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:02):**  Thank you.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:04):**  I just wanted to follow up on the point of the food companies and the role of food companies  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:09):**  because I think that a lot of the discussion is how do we grow the food?  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:14):**  So on the really the agricultural side of it.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:16):**  But I think it's really important to remember that the structure of the farms, particularly  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:22):**  monocultures are there because the buyer wants large quantities.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:28):**  So I'm wondering, you know, from, from a small farmer perspective and I think, Malia, if  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:35):**  I'm pronouncing your name correctly, that you were asking about smallholder farmers  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:39):**  and how they can participate in this.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:42):**  I think one of the big questions is who's buying the hundred different varieties of  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:47):**  food and spices and herbs that are being produced off of a regenerative farm.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:52):**  And it's not just one product, it's not just one commodity.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:43:56):**  And so I think this, this marketing aspect, I'm just wondering if there's, if there's  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:00):**  a, if the conversation has gotten to how to incorporate more food companies.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:07):**  I mean, you mentioned the super foods and things like that.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:11):**  It's definitely necessary.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:13):**  I'm just wondering how many, if, if there are food companies that are actively participating  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:17):**  in this so far.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:19):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:20):**  It's, it's sort of the bundling, unbundling and the bundling.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:23):**  I think it's a question that we've actually had.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:26):**  I don't remember if Lenny talked about it of one, two, three on this, on one of the  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:32):**  Ask Me Anything webinars.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:33):**  It's something they struggle with because you can only make your agroforestry system  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:37):**  so complex that at some point you have too many species and thus you have only a few  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:41):**  kilos of everything and thus you cannot sell it.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:44):**  So there's a tension there with complexity of what you would like to do and what you  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:47):**  can actually sell in right enough quantities to, to make sense for your market.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:52):**  And there, I think you're going to see a bundling of farmers getting together, starting some  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:55):**  processing together.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:44:57):**  And you get sort of this unbundling and bundling that you constantly see in every sector happening.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:03):**  And I think we need to be careful there and keep asking those questions, like how complex  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:10):**  do you want to have it and what can you actually sell and what are cash crops and whatnot.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:13):**  And I know these discussions are happening in agroforestry.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:16):**  I know that Earthworm Foundation in Indonesia actually set up a processing company to process  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:21):**  everything that comes out of some of their pilot forests, which we're obviously scared  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:25):**  to do a podcast about, which is not happening yet.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:28):**  But they see that as local processing comes into that, decentralized, but you have a certain,  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:33):**  you need a certain scale to process the garlic or to process if you want to process that.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:38):**  And that's, that's a tension that many of these, what you see many of these advanced  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:42):**  farmers that are using regenerative practices, they start at some point in the processing  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:47):**  company for them, their friends, their neighbors, because they have this some kind of heirloom  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:52):**  weed that fits perfectly in their rotation, but nobody wants to buy it.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:55):**  And so they actually figure out how to process it themselves.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:45:59):**  And there are actually very interesting mini processing units coming on the market that  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:05):**  that are like the mini grinders.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:07):**  And there are interesting things happening there, but there is a tension between scale  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:11):**  and the economies of scale obviously exists.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:15):**  And so it's, it's not an easy one and we'd love to have 25 species in our agroforestry  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:20):**  system, but if you can only sell two of them, you're probably gonna end up focusing a bit  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:25):**  more on that.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:26):**  So it's a tension there as we scale this from a few hectares to thousands of hectares.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:30):**  And I know it's a tension that the large agroforestry players like one, two, three are working on.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:35):**  Like, what can we do more than just the cacao?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:38):**  In terms of quality, what's very interesting is you have a lot of this very high end ones,  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:41):**  like in terms of cacao being to bar like super specific, almost like wine, like we really  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:47):**  focused on a certain year, et cetera.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:49):**  But what's interesting is that the big players that are buying a lot of cacao are starting  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:54):**  to look not for that type of quality, but just below that, like they want higher end  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:46:57):**  cacao and they're willing to pay for that as well.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:00):**  So in some crops, you can see that the market is starting to shift or a reasonable amount  
**[0:47:05-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:05):**  of the market is starting to shift towards quality.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:07):**  And that makes the system possible.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:08):**  That makes it possible to focus on quality.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:11):**  And so focus on those crops where there is a premium on quality and it could be certain  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:17):**  protein levels.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:18):**  It could be a lot of farmers are incorporating certain species into their rotation in North  
**[0:47:23-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:23):**  America.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:24):**  Why?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:25):**  Because there is the artisanal beer movement that is looking for certain things in their  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:27):**  beers and is willing to pay for that.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:29):**  And it might be one piece of your rotation, but it might make the whole thing worth it.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:33):**  So it's a puzzle and you would love to do it more complex than probably you can find  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:37):**  buyers for at the moment.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:38):**  And that's what everybody's going through.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:42):**  And with that, I would like to use a few more minutes to actually answer some questions  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:46):**  or try to answer some questions in the chat.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:49):**  We go back a bit.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:50):**  I saw Deidre asking, is there a European bank that might grandfather finance to all European  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:54):**  countries for these transitions?  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:47:57):**  We had actually Triodos Bank on the podcast that admitted immediately that they're quite  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:02):**  comfortable with organic, but not at all comfortable with regenerative transitions yet, but they're  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:06):**  super interested to follow and actually have a regenerative money center now that has a  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:10):**  website as well, which they didn't have when we interviewed them.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:13):**  So there are banks looking at it.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:15):**  I know some German banks are looking at it, but it's still, they need 20, 30 years of  
**[0:48:19-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:19):**  data in some cases.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:20):**  So they need to be comfortable with these transitions and need to say, okay, you're  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:23):**  going to take your grain farm from this from A to B. And I know the premium and I know  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:26):**  you have an offtake agreement lined up.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:29):**  And so I can finance it because the newest things here in terms of transition finance  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:34):**  are not going to come from banks.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:36):**  They're going to come from funds, private individuals, crowdfunding, crowd investing  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:39):**  platforms, super interesting.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:41):**  A lot is happening there.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:43):**  They're going to come from all of us trying to finance the transitions.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:46):**  And then when we have the data, the big money hopefully will come, but we should definitely  
**[0:48:50-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:50):**  plan for that to make sure that we can basically tap into the larger money sources, which are  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:48:57):**  green bonds, which are banks, which are insurance companies, et cetera.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:02):**  Regenerative ag bond investment opportunities.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:04):**  Peter, great question.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:05):**  I know one which was five times oversubscribed.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:08):**  So the answer, at least from my side, but please correct me if I'm wrong, there isn't  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:12):**  too much there yet.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:13):**  There's a lot of sustainable or renewable energy obviously happening on the bond market.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:19):**  And the fact that Rizoma managed to do the first one now, I think is a great moment.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:25):**  And I hope there will be many more that really put this type of money to work.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:29):**  So far, there was one which was fully filled with Brazilian investors.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:34):**  And I know some investors tried to get in from outside and it wasn't possible.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:39):**  And another question, global impact investment space, interact.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:45):**  That's a very interesting question.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:49):**  What is the role going to be of the EU versus the state versus the regions?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:53):**  Don't forget the regions in Europe, very important.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:55):**  I think it's going to be, that's where the pain is felt.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:49:57):**  I mean, there were massive floods in Northern Italy, massive droughts in the Netherlands.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:02):**  I think this is going to be in many cases tied to regional approaches and maybe connected  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:07):**  to some European money or some state money, but don't expect regeneration to be on any  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:14):**  of the, let's say, to do lists of that.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:17):**  There's obviously a lot of interesting work happening in Brussels with the farm to fork,  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:22):**  et cetera, but it could also be easily hijacked by some other forces.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:26):**  So I think it's going to be in many cases regional that feel the pain of the floods  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:32):**  of droughts, et cetera, that are going to act on this and get involved and hopefully  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:37):**  move things.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:38):**  I see an answer from Joe.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:41):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:42):**  And for Fenny, which is great.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:46):**  We need help to the public to understand the benefits.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:50):**  That's going to be an enormous task to all of us because we've been trained to think  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:50:56):**  that all food is the same if it's called the same.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:00):**  Somebody said on the podcast once, Organic taught us a great job of looking at the label.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:04):**  Now we need to look beyond.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:06):**  That's a massive, we need a lot of smart marketing and communication folks to do that.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:11):**  Alan, this can be done through small local gardens.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:16):**  Thank you.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:17):**  What's this nutrient density do?  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:18):**  It's the bio-nutrient food association and it's called the bio-nutrient food meter, but  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:23):**  I will definitely put it in the show notes as I will copy this.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:27):**  Jeffrey, I will copy this question.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:31):**  What are some of the best examples that's already a plural of successful watershed scale  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:35):**  regenerative projects?  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:38):**  Not too many is the short answer, Charles.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:41):**  So I would definitely look at common land who's doing a number of these or a number  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:44):**  of their spinoffs actually.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:47):**  There is WWF, the Sustainable Landscape Finance Lab, where I interviewed Paul Chatterton,  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:54):**  came out with an interesting research recently.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:57):**  So there's some work around this.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:51:59):**  I mean, we've interviewed a few people.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:01):**  I will put them in the show notes, but there are very, very few people looking at landscape  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:05):**  size, unfortunately.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:06):**  I think this is going to be one of the big discussions we need to have.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:10):**  How do we get permaculture to a landscape scale?  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:13):**  How do we get regenerative practices to thousands and thousands of factors and how to figure  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:16):**  out what to do where and why?  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:18):**  So there are not too many examples, at least now that I know, that are extremely successful.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:23):**  Cool, you did a great interview.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:29):**  Thank you very much, Vincent.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:30):**  With the perennial fund, do you think that could work in Europe as well?  
**[0:52:33-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:33):**  Absolutely, yes.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:34):**  And I hope many people will start perennial funds, plural, because I think we needed that  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:39):**  kind of skin in the game transition finance for a lot of crops and a lot of regions.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:43):**  Again, there, I think we're going to see a lot of, let's say, experts that are really  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:48):**  good at helping transition farmers starting to also offer finance for those farmers.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:53):**  Because in many cases, the business model for the consultants at the moment in this  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:52:57):**  space is selling their time to farmers that are living on very small margins.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:01):**  So that's not a very easy business.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:02):**  But if you can also offer the finance and maybe the offtake agreements, which is something  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:06):**  a perennial fund together with Pipeline Foods does, then you have a very interesting package.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:10):**  And again, coming back to how do we help farmers in that transition, a very interesting package,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:15):**  both finance, access to knowledge, which a lot of these consultants have, and access  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:19):**  to markets.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:20):**  And then you have a winning combination.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:22):**  One of the two, one of the three is not enough.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:24):**  I think all three are key.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:25):**  And I hope to see many, many, many perennial funds.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:27):**  They're closing their round in the US, which is very small, unfortunately, but they're  
**[0:53:31-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:31):**  closing, which is great.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:33):**  And I hope to have them back soon to share some updates, but they should be hitting the  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:36):**  ground running soon.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:38):**  And hopefully we're going to learn a lot from that.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:40):**  But this kind of skin in the game, really partnering with the farmer.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:45):**  When the farmer is making money, you're making money.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:46):**  When the farmer is not, you're not.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:48):**  And helping him or her through that transition, I think, is going to be crucial, especially  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:52):**  in this phase where there's no easy access to other types of finance.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:53:56):**  Ah, great, Jeroen.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:01):**  I would absolutely love more info on that.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:04):**  I think they spun off the company, if I remember correctly, but I don't remember the details.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:10):**  I answered that one.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:15):**  Ellen.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:17):**  Definitely, many farmers are opening up for tours, et cetera, and other income streams.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:23):**  I mean, tourism is a bit tricky.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:25):**  But for instance, office spaces, I mean, there are many, many options to obviously use the  
**[0:54:32-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:32):**  land in different ways and basically stack business models on top of each other.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:39):**  What's the best way to connect to farmers?  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:41):**  Go and have coffee and learn and listen.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:44):**  Mike, that would be my advice in any circumstances.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:48):**  Go and listen because there's so much to learn there.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:53):**  Should regeneratively marketed pets and endless discussion.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:54:56):**  I know an open plan, but there's definitely a lot of work being done on regenerative organic  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:00):**  at the moment by Patagonia, Dr. Bronner's and their partners in Rodale.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:06):**  I don't know yet.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:07):**  I haven't figured out my opinion on should we label this in the label fatigue we have.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:14):**  I think in some products it makes sense and in some cases it gives the confidence to the  
**[0:55:17-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:17):**  market.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:18):**  In many others, it might not.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:19):**  And they distract.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:20):**  They're doing very interesting work and I hope to have Elizabeth who's running it on  
**[0:55:24-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:24):**  the podcast soon.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:25):**  But I also know a lot of people are very scared of other labels and other yes and no questions  
**[0:55:29-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:29):**  like you are or you're not regenerative and it's a journey, another destination.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:34):**  I mean, those kinds of things are tricky.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:42):**  I think I'm going to wrap it up because we're already two minutes over and I want to make  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:46):**  sure.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:47):**  Can you address the interface between certification labeling branding?  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:54):**  That's one for another time.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:55):**  I will try to add something there.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:55:57):**  Amy, but I think we're not going to make it now.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:01):**  So unless there are any burning last questions, I would love to wrap it up and thank you so  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:07):**  much for your time and for anybody that's still here after more than an hour.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:12):**  I will put as much as I can in the show notes, which probably should be out by tomorrow,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:17):**  the day after tomorrow.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:18):**  And obviously also the recording, which feel free to share and share it right in.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:23):**  And if you have any questions, you can go to the website where we put all the podcasts  
**[0:56:27-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:27):**  and obviously you can find out the course we did on YouTube and also via Gumroad.

**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:46):**  Thanks Koen.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:48):**  Bye.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:49):**  Thank you Koen.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:52):**  Very good.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:54):**  Dear friends of the podcast.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:56:57):**  I'm super excited to share with you the online video course, investing in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:02):**  and food, how to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty  
**[0:57:07-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:07):**  food while doing it.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:09):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:13):**  audio asking the question, how to put money to work in regenerating soils.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:17):**  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:21):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:24):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:26):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:29):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:31):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:34):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:57:35-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:35):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:37):**  What should you read?  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:38):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:39):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:41):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:57:43-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:43):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:44):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:49):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:54):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:57:58-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:57:58):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:02):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:06):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:10):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:58:16-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:16):**  et cetera.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:17):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:18):**  No.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:19):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:21):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:25):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:58:30-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:30):**  different means.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:31):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:36):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:39):**  Thank you.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:40):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:41):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:47):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:49):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:54-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:58:54):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:00):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:59:04-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:04):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:06):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:11):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:15):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:19):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:20-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:20):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:22):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:25):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:28):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:31):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:36):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-10-13-2020/#t=0:59:39):**  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

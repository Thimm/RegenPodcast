**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.

**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:16):**  We're going to talk about the issues facing Indian farmers and how Farmerson is trying  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:21):**  to bring back old methods of natural farming while using the latest technologies.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:25):**  And using this tech to bring these complex natural farming methods and rotation systems  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:30):**  to smallholder farmers.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:32):**  And why India and China are very interesting markets when it comes to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:37):**  And how Shamik raised his first seed round from investors that weren't used to investing  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:42):**  in anything but tech and software.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:44):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:45):**  Just a small correction, Shamik connected with me after and corrected me that not 25  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:51):**  farmers per hour but 25 farmers per day commit suicide in India.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:00:55):**  Which is of course still way too much but luckily 24 times less than what we discussed  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:00):**  in this interview.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:03):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:07):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:09):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:13):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:18):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:23):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:25):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:29):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:32):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:37):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:41):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:45):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:49):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, their  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:53):**  many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more depth,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:01:58):**  improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:02):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:07):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:11):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:13):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:19):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:21):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:23):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:27):**  I'm Kumo Sayin, your host.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:28):**  In a podcast of today, I'm talking to Shamik Chagavati, co-founder of Farmasyn, based in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:33):**  Bangalore, India.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:34):**  On Farmasyn, everyone can rent mini plots of farmland close to the city.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:38):**  You choose your vegetables and farmers then grow them organically for you and you keep  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:42):**  track of the harvest using the app.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:44):**  Basically, it's a real life version, organic version of FarmVille.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:48):**  Welcome Shamik.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:49):**  Hi, Koen, how are you?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:51):**  I'm good, I'm good.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:52):**  Thank you so much for making the time.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:54):**  Just to start with a personal question after a career at Amazon and other high tech jobs,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:02:59):**  what made you go back to the land and start something very, very different and close to  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:06):**  Bangalore?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:07):**  Right.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:08):**  So I think there are two reasons for that, right?  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:10):**  One is as a consumer myself, I don't have access to chemical free food, which I can  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:16):**  actually trust, right?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:17):**  Because the supply chain of fresh produce in India, the way it works is that, let's  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:23):**  say I'm buying something which is being marketed to me as organic, and I go ahead and place  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:29):**  an order on an online site.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:30):**  The unfortunate thing is that because there are so many intermediaries in the supply chain,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:34):**  a lot of times the produce that comes to me is not really organic and most consumers now  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:38):**  know this as well.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:39):**  So there really is no source for, or a very limited source for chemical free food for  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:44):**  Indian consumers at this point of time, because most of us believe that what is being marketed  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:49):**  to us as organic is not really organic.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:51):**  That's number one.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:52):**  So from my personal perspective, I wanted to have a source of chemical free food.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:03:56):**  On the other hand, farmers in India have a big problem in the next half an hour or so  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:01):**  as we talk to each other, probably about 20-25 farmers in India are going to commit suicide,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:08):**  right?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:09):**  And a large reason for that being income problems.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:12):**  And we'll talk a little bit in detail about what sort of issues they face.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:15):**  So that's also something that we have been talking about a lot.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:18):**  We read it in newspapers, we see farmers protest, etc.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:21):**  And we wanted to do something around this.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:22):**  So these are two of the reasons why we said let's do something very meaningful.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:25):**  We have built a lot of technology in various different companies, Yahoo, Amazon, etc.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:30):**  But let's do something for India and something which actually impacts a lot of lives.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:34):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:35):**  And can you just because I did a very brief introduction, but can you just walk us through  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:40):**  what Farmizen is, what it means, how long you've been operating and how it's going basically.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:45):**  We're now in November 2017.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:47):**  So what's the current state of affairs?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:48):**  Okay, so we launched somewhere in June, so not too long back, right about what, five  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:53):**  months back.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:54):**  The idea really has been to, the easiest way to explain how Farmizen works is think of  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:04:59):**  it as a real life FarmVille, right?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:01):**  So just like we used to play this FarmVille game on Facebook, and we used to get a patch  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:05):**  of land, plant different things, then harvest them, take care of them, all of that stuff.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:09):**  So this is very similar.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:10):**  The only difference being is that you won't earn virtual coins, you earn actual vegetables,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:15):**  right, while doing that.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:17):**  It seems much better.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:18):**  So consumers basically have an app which is available on both Android as well as on iOS.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:23):**  They use that app to control a mini farm.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:26):**  A mini farm is 600 square feet in size.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:28):**  It's divided up into 12 raised beds.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:30):**  There is already drip irrigation, etc.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:32):**  Set up and consumers pick and choose what they want to grow in each of them.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:36):**  Whereas climate kind of allows us to grow multiple different veggies all throughout  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:41):**  the year.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:42):**  We don't have a very strong winter season, etc., for example, right?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:46):**  And in the app, they keep on seeing a bunch of updates, right?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:49):**  So for example, when their tomatoes are flowering, they would get an update in the app and they  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:52):**  would know what's happening.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:54):**  When it's ready for harvest, they can come and visit the farm, harvest their own produce  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:58):**  themselves.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:05:59):**  They can also come and volunteer at the farm, etc.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:01):**  But very often what happens is people get busy, right?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:03):**  They might be able to come for four weekends and then there are deadlines at work, etc.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:07):**  So they get busy for a couple of months.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:10):**  And at that point of time, we would actually do a home delivery of their veggies.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:13):**  So we would harvest it and deliver it to their homes.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:16):**  The way this works internally is we operate in partnership with farmers, right?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:21):**  So farmers are responsible for land, labor, water, electricity, supervision.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:26):**  So the production aspects of it, right?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:28):**  While Farmizen takes care of everything else, right?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:31):**  So marketing, customer engagement, customer service, all of the technology behind it,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:35):**  and I'll explain a few bits of tech pieces that we have as well.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:39):**  All of the inputs, so we want to make sure that the farmers use high quality seeds, high  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:43):**  quality organic inputs.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:44):**  So we supply those to them as well, right?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:47):**  And the deliveries, usually most of Indian farmers would not be able to afford or even  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:52):**  take out the time to have a delivery truck and figure out how to do these deliveries.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:56):**  So we take care of that as well.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:06:58):**  So it's just like, for example, when you have the Amazon marketplace, right, where sellers  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:02):**  sell their products, but Amazon takes care of everything else, right?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:05):**  So it's very similar to that, where we work in a partnership with farmers.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:09):**  Now, so the consumers have an app, right?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:12):**  Similarly, farmers have an app as well, right?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:15):**  And the reason farmers have an app is because most of the farmers that we partner with,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:18):**  they have typically grown maybe three or four different types of vegetables before, right?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:22):**  And they specialize in that.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:23):**  Many of them have come from a mono cropping sort of a background.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:26):**  Whereas in our situation, it's completely multi cropping based, right, which means that,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:31):**  for example, currently, in this season, we support about anything between around 40 to  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:36):**  50 different types of vegetables, right?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:39):**  So these farmers obviously do not know how do I manage what sort of planting regimen  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:43):**  should be used?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:44):**  What pests could attack each of these plants?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:47):**  So they don't know all of these things.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:48):**  So which is why we created an app for the farmer as well, right?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:51):**  Wow, to really take care of that education part to grow from the monoculture to 30, 40,  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:57):**  50 different vegetables.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:07:58):**  That's that's a huge step.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:00):**  That's correct.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:01):**  So what this app does is it acts like a smart to do list, right?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:05):**  So it's like a to do list for the farmer.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:06):**  So the farmer goes to the field, and he sees, okay, there are these five tasks that I need  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:10):**  to do today.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:11):**  I there's a new customer who has come in, I need to plant on bed number one, I need  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:15):**  to plant tomatoes on bed number two, I need to put broccoli bed number three, I need to  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:19):**  put kale, right, etc.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:21):**  Then they see, okay, that was the planting task.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:23):**  Okay, after two days, we need to put a microbe inoculant into the soil, right?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:29):**  So I need to start preparing it.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:31):**  And I'll tell you a little bit about how we try to create these microbe solutions, etc.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:36):**  And we try to do them in a very natural way, rather than actually buying a lot of inputs  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:40):**  from the market.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:41):**  So we tell them what is the formula for creating that, right, and what they need to do.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:46):**  So it not just helps them in terms of figuring out pests, diseases, planting regimens, but  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:51):**  it basically gives them a very structured to do list.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:54):**  Remember, a lot of farmers in India are not even literate, right?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:08:59):**  So which means that our app needs to be extremely simple.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:02):**  So our app basically has voice support, so they could click on an icon, right, and it  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:06):**  will basically read out the instructions to them in their language that this is these  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:10):**  are the five things you need to do today.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:12):**  Once they do that, they click a big green button, and the update goes to the consumer,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:16):**  right?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:17):**  So the consumer knows my plants have been watered today, de-weeding has been done, this  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:21):**  specific organic fertilizer was applied.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:23):**  So they keep seeing all of those updates, which means that when they get delivery of  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:27):**  the carrots, for example, right, they can basically go back into their app and they  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:31):**  could see, okay, these carrots were sowed on this day, right?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:34):**  This is when the things had a pest attack, and this was what was applied on it, right?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:40):**  And this is when it got ready.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:41):**  So they pretty much see the entire traceability aspect of it.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:44):**  So that's how this works.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:46):**  Now, just taking a step back, why did we do this, right?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:50):**  I talked about this whole chemical free stuff.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:09:53):**  So the reason why farmers in India use chemicals is not because they don't care, it's because  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:00):**  they don't have any other option, right?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:02):**  Farming in India is a big vicious cycle, right?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:05):**  Where most farmers on an average, they make very little money, not enough to actually  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:12):**  have a living wage, right?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:14):**  The problems that Indian farming faces are as follows.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:17):**  There is a big problem with respect to financing, right?  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:21):**  There's a lack of access to adequate credit in the system.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:24):**  The risk in the agriculture value chain is completely skewed by towards the farmer, right?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:30):**  They produce the most value, but because there are so many intermediaries in the supply chain,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:34):**  the farmers take most of the risk, right?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:36):**  The retailer takes very little risk, the commission agent who's there in the middle, he takes  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:41):**  very little risk, right?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:43):**  And so this is one part.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:45):**  Second part is there is also a lot of price risk as well, right?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:47):**  Very often, the farmer might have spent two, three months getting a very good yield of  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:52):**  tomatoes.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:53):**  And when they go to the market, they realize that the prices have crashed so much that  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:10:56):**  it hardly even covers the transportation cost of taking it from the farm to the clearing  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:00):**  house, right?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:02):**  So that's the second problem.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:04):**  A bunch of distribution inefficiencies are also there, beyond the fact that there are  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:08):**  on an average about five to six intermediaries from farm to fork.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:12):**  The other big problem is that there is a huge lack of cold chains in the Indian scenario,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:16):**  right?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:17):**  The cold chains that we have in India is hardly enough to cover 10% of what is actually required,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:23):**  right?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:24):**  So which means that there is a lot of wastage of produce as well, right?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:27):**  In fact, the estimates in India are about post-harvest wastage is almost 40 to 45%,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:32):**  right?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:33):**  Across multiple different type of agricultural commodities.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:36):**  So there are a lot of distribution inefficiencies.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:38):**  In addition, there are also production inefficiencies, right?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:41):**  Farmers have limited access to quality inputs, know-how, technology, etc.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:45):**  The typical way that the farmer operates is they go to the local seeds and pesticide shop,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:51):**  right?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:52):**  And they go and ask this guy, hey, what do I grow?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:54):**  What should I grow?  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:55):**  Right?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:11:56):**  And the pesticide shop owner kind of acts as the plant doctor, right?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:00):**  And he basically tells him, this is what you do.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:01):**  If there's a problem, put these chemicals.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:03):**  If that problem comes, put that chemical Z, right?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:06):**  So this is how it operates.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:08):**  Along with all of these inefficiencies, the other big problem is that average farm size  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:13):**  holding in India is very small.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:15):**  So 85% of Indian farmers own less than four and a half acres of land.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:19):**  And this average farm size is actually declining every year, right?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:23):**  So the farms are getting smaller and smaller.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:25):**  Because they're being cut up because they go down in generations.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:28):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:29):**  You are right.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:30):**  Because they're like, there was one father, he had a four acre farm.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:34):**  Now he has two sons.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:35):**  So the farm is going to get divided between them two acres, two acres each, right?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:39):**  So because of that, the average farm size being so low in India, the problem is, I mean,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:45):**  just and from a comparison perspective, an average US farmer has about 100 times more  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:51):**  land than an average Indian farmer, right?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:54):**  Now, so coupled with the small farm sizes and all of these inefficiencies, what happens  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:12:59):**  is that it's extremely difficult, probably even impossible to earn a living wage, right?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:05):**  The typical farmers that we talk to now, they are within a 20-30 kilometer range of the  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:10):**  city at the current stage at Farmison, right?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:13):**  And what we see is they make about somewhere around five to 6000 rupees per acre, right?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:20):**  As their monthly income, which means just to put it into US dollars, that's less than  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:24):**  $100 per acre, right?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:26):**  Per month.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:27):**  So you have a, and most farmers in India, although the median size I mentioned is about  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:33):**  four and a half acres, if you talk to most farmers, nine out of 10 farmers, they'll say  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:38):**  they have about one and a half acres or two acres of land, which means that they're basically  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:42):**  after putting all of this hard work, they're making a couple of hundred dollars, right?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:48):**  Every month, right?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:50):**  And that too, it is not guaranteed because of all of the risks that I mentioned, there's  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:54):**  a big risk that crops will fail, in which case you have put in three months of effort,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:13:58):**  you have taken a loan to buy your seeds, etc.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:01):**  And then you are supposed to get your 200-300 dollars and that just vanishes, right?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:07):**  So because of this, farmers have been committing a lot of suicides, etc. in India.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:11):**  It's a big problem in India right now.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:13):**  Now, what do you do if you're a farmer and you know that if you make a mistake or if  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:17):**  your crops fail, you are going to lose all of your money and you will not have money  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:22):**  to eat, right?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:23):**  What do you do as a farmer?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:24):**  As a farmer, you try to reduce your risk.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:26):**  And the easiest way to reduce short term risk is by adopting practices, growing practices,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:31):**  which are harmful to the soil and environment, right?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:34):**  So you will end up using chemical pesticides, although as a farmer, you know that it's probably  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:37):**  killing your soil in the longer run, but you will end up doing that because it's a matter  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:41):**  of your survival.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:42):**  So that's what has been happening with the Indian farmer.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:44):**  And because of this, it's not just a problem with the farmers, this is all affecting consumers  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:49):**  as well, right?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:50):**  Because India's topsoil quality, which was amongst the best in the world, has been deteriorating  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:54):**  rapidly, right?  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:55):**  Because of a lot of this chemical farming, etc.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:14:58):**  The historically speaking, India had a very, very interesting culture of doing farming  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:06):**  in a very natural way, what's called natural farming, right?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:09):**  Very similar to some of the principles of Fukuoka's natural farming, for example, right?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:15):**  So we try to adopt a bunch of those sort of things also at Farmison.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:20):**  There is a renewed interest in regenerative agriculture in India.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:24):**  Andhra Pradesh, one of the states in India, for example, recently said, hey, we are going  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:29):**  to adopt zero budget natural farming.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:33):**  And I'll talk a little bit about the zero budget part of it.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:35):**  We are going to adopt zero budget natural farming as the preferred methodology of farming.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:40):**  There's another state in India, very small hill state called Sikkim.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:43):**  Sikkim has become the first organic state, right?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:45):**  So everything that's grown in Sikkim is completely organic, because the government does not allow  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:49):**  anything inorganic to be sold in terms of imports, etc.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:53):**  Right?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:54):**  So some of this is already changing, so which is good.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:15:57):**  But we wanted to kind of participate in this process of reviving Indian agriculture in  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:02):**  a way which is very sustainable.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:05):**  So that's the way this thing works.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:09):**  Did that answer your question?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:10):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:11):**  And it raises, obviously, a lot of other questions.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:13):**  I think the mission is enormous, extremely important and at a very interesting time.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:19):**  I mean, the focus in general, I think on food and quality and what actually is in the food  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:24):**  you're eating plus transparency and what now is possible with technology puts you at a  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:29):**  very interesting moment.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:31):**  I was wondering if the farmers and the farms you work with and you partner with, how do  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:38):**  you keep track of the soil and the land and how do you keep track of what actually is  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:42):**  the farmer putting in his app, what he or she is doing that had actually happened?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:46):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:47):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:48):**  So various parts of our business model have been thought through from various different  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:52):**  directions.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:53):**  For example, you mentioned right now what's the guarantee that the farmer is actually  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:16:57):**  doing what he's saying, right, when he's clicking on the big green button.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:01):**  So a couple of things.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:02):**  First of all, we encourage our customers, right, farmisans to visit the farms as often  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:09):**  as they can.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:10):**  Right.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:11):**  Even if they don't come every weekend, every two or three weekends, they end up visiting  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:14):**  the farm, they end up doing stuff on their own, etc.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:16):**  So which means at any point in the farm, let's say, let's take a farm which has 200 subscribers,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:20):**  right.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:21):**  So they are the sensors basically for you.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:23):**  Correct.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:24):**  So think of it as a crowd-sourced audit, so to speak.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:26):**  Right.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:27):**  So the second thing that we do is we actually send out drones, right.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:31):**  And this is where some of our earlier technology background kind of help us.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:35):**  So what we have ended up doing is usually agricultural drones, etc. are quite costly,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:39):**  right.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:40):**  And they might not be, they might put a big cost burden.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:44):**  But what we have done is essentially use consumer level drones, right.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:47):**  And we have built some technology on top of that, which helps us monitor a lot of these  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:51):**  things, right.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:52):**  So we send a drone out to the fields every three, four days.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:17:57):**  What that does is it does, it takes a fairly high resolution image of all of the mini farms  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:02):**  in the farm, right.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:04):**  And these are all individual beds as well.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:06):**  So for example, if you have 200 subscribers, that's 200 into 12, 2400 different raised  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:11):**  beds in which crops are growing.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:14):**  So we get all of these high images of, high resolution images of each of those beds, right.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:18):**  Those get uploaded to a central server, our horticulturist or slash agronomist who sits  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:23):**  in our office, he basically gets to see all of those images on a daily basis, right.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:28):**  So now let's say a farmer has marked in the app saying, I have done de-weeding, right.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:34):**  Usually in natural farming, when you are not using weeding sites, etc.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:38):**  Weeding is a very large part of their effort, it will take 20-30% of their effort easily,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:43):**  right.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:44):**  So the farmer has said, hey, I have done de-weeding on this side of the farm, but the horticulturist  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:50):**  could see it and he could see weeds in the picture, right.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:53):**  So he knows that, okay, what he said is not what is being done.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:57):**  So then he can intervene.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:58):**  So these sort of things.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:18:59):**  Also, this allows us to monitor things like growing growth stages of the plant, right.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:04):**  And to adapt your coaching app for the farmers, of course, not just because if they don't  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:08):**  do something, but maybe some of the growing is going differently than you imagined.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:13):**  So we can intervene immediately.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:14):**  So that's the second aspect of how we try to monitor this.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:18):**  Third thing, and this I think I have not highlighted so far.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:21):**  And this is actually the most important aspect of it, is that our business model is a subscription  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:26):**  based business model, right.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:28):**  So consumers pay 2500, about $40 per month, consumers pay, which includes everything,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:35):**  all the deliveries, all the inputs, their renting of the farm, whatever, right.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:40):**  Now because of that, farmers are assured of an income every month, right.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:44):**  So they have zero incentive to apply chemicals or take short term measures, because essentially  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:50):**  the consumers are taking a large part of the yield risk on them, right.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:54):**  So thereby, the farmers do what is right for their soil.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:19:57):**  See end of the day, farmers are a lot more sensitive to the fact that the soil needs  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:04):**  to be alive and good because their livelihood depends on it, right.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:08):**  And they have seen too many instances of soil fertility going down over time, right.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:12):**  It's a real partnership with aligned incentives.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:15):**  So which is why because of these incentives, there is basically no reason for farmers to  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:20):**  do anything which is outside the system because they get paid based on inputs, not based on  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:25):**  outputs, which is a fundamental shift from how agriculture always has happened, right.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:29):**  No, definitely.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:30):**  And to give a state of just to do a picture at the moment, the end of November 2017, how  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:36):**  many people of course, if you're okay sharing and share to the level of you want to share,  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:42):**  how many farms, how many people are on the platform?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:45):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:46):**  So right now, we just we are just at I think five farms right now, right, a few more are  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:53):**  launching, right.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:20:54):**  And we are at about 350 customers right now, our target is to reach about 2000 subscribers  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:02):**  by January.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:03):**  So that's happening.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:04):**  We are not demand constrained right now.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:05):**  We are more supply constrained in the sense that what we want to do is we need to find  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:11):**  always the right farming partners, right, to make sure that this is a farmer who, who's  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:18):**  also equally committed to sustainable farming, right.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:21):**  So and very interesting, a lot of the, so initially, we started trying to reach out  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:25):**  to farmers directly, etc.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:27):**  And we saw that it was difficult to convince them because they are quite, they would have  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:32):**  a lot of, they get confused with the model.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:34):**  Are you sure this is something very new, etc.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:37):**  But what's happening now is the existing farmers, they are referring other farmers, right.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:42):**  And they come to the field, see how it's working, see the fact that they have been able to get  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:48):**  customers going, etc.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:50):**  Right.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:51):**  And that they are making their money as well.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:53):**  And this thing is working.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:54):**  So once they come to the farm, see it, then they are also trying to build it up.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:21:58):**  We will still, we will, we will still not very quickly go to 50,000 subscribers, etc.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:04):**  Because there are a lot of things we are discovering as well, primarily with respect to the production  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:08):**  process, right, which we want to make sure that those get solved with time.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:12):**  For example, since we are doing everything in a natural mode without any pesticides,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:16):**  etc.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:19):**  Pest attacks are a big problem that you're trying to solve, right.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:22):**  And we are also learning while doing this entire thing.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:25):**  So the way we try to solve pest attacks is by fairly standard mechanisms.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:29):**  So we plant trap crops, right, for example, mustard greens, etc, which basically attract  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:34):**  the pests, and they leave the main crops aside, right.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:38):**  So those sort of things, we are also experimenting with specific biocontrol agents as well, right,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:42):**  introducing predatory insects into the fields, etc, which eat other insects and bugs, right.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:48):**  We also do a bunch of different things, for example, and some of these are very specific  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:52):**  to India as well.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:53):**  For example, we have this flower called marigold, right, and we plant a lot of marigold between  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:22:58):**  our beds, because not only does it attract pollinators, but it also ends up, there are  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:05):**  alkaloids in the roots of marigolds, which repel a lot of pests, right.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:09):**  So there is a lot of learning that's happening at our end as well.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:12):**  So our farmer app, we are updating with all of these things.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:15):**  So we want to make sure that we grow gradually, not grow absolutely suddenly with a lot of,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:21):**  so we see a lot of consumer demand though, and usually what happens is there is some  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:26):**  level of virality in how this proposition works, right.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:29):**  Once a consumer starts getting his produce.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:31):**  Of course, it's amazing to share, like, the vegetables from my farm just arrived, of course,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:36):**  I put it on Instagram.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:38):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:39):**  So most, so we haven't, we just started, in fact, we just started experimenting with advertising,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:45):**  etc, maybe have spent like $100 so far.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:49):**  But otherwise, so far, all of these customers have clearly come through word of mouth and  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:53):**  one existing customer introducing another customer, right, and telling them, hey, I'm  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:23:57):**  going to the farm next time, can you come?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:00):**  Interesting thing is, see, India cities are also, we have become concrete jungles, there's  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:05):**  not too much of greenery, there are not too many public parks inside the city, right.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:09):**  Now these farms are all located within perimeter areas of the city.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:13):**  So these are also turning out to be good spots to just spend your, you know, you go there  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:17):**  on a Saturday afternoon and spend three, four hours there, right.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:22):**  Maybe do a picnic there.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:23):**  So these are also starting to develop as those sort of spots, just green areas where you  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:27):**  like to spend your weekends at because of a lack of public parks in the city, right.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:32):**  So when somebody comes to a farm, they invariably get a few friends along, right.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:36):**  And they say, hey, we are going to have a small tea party here, right.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:39):**  So those friends come in and they say, oh, can I sign up for this?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:41):**  Okay, let me get onto the waitlist.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:43):**  So when it opens up, we'll sign up for this, right.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:46):**  So that's how most of the growth has been happening.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:48):**  No, extremely, extremely interesting.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:50):**  And just to take one step back and look at the control of what I have as a subscriber  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:56):**  versus your organic rotations.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:24:59):**  That's something you can manage, obviously.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:01):**  But if I keep saying with all my neighbors, I want only carrots, how much space is there  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:08):**  for your agronomist and horticulturist to really manage that and build up the soil and  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:13):**  put all the beds versus the control as the subscribers have.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:17):**  Sure.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:18):**  So if I understand the question, what you're saying is that can they grow multiple different  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:22):**  things in different beds or do they grow just one thing?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:25):**  Is that what you're asking?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:26):**  No, I'm yes and no.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:28):**  I'm mostly looking to build up your soil.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:31):**  In general, you need quite a complex rotation system.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:34):**  And you need you as a farmer, you need to be in control or as in this case, an organization  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:38):**  above the farmer or next to the farm need to be in control and figuring out, okay, maybe  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:42):**  better this year to put the tomatoes there instead of there.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:46):**  But how does that clash with me as a subscriber that maybe wants the tomatoes there?  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:53):**  So that's a very good point.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:54):**  So the way we do it is when people click on a particular bed in their app, right, and  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:25:58):**  they say, okay, I had tomatoes growing here and I need to rotate the crop.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:03):**  So they click on the bed and then there's a recommended list of crops, right?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:06):**  So we give them, this is the top most recommended.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:09):**  Okay, you're already down.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:10):**  Yeah, you already decreased the amount of options and basically, I would also teach  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:14):**  people about rotation.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:16):**  So basically, they can still choose something which is not recommended.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:19):**  So they can still go ahead and plant tomato.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:21):**  But we highlight it in the app saying that, you know what, your yield is at risk, the  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:24):**  soil quality will be at risk if you do this.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:27):**  So they still have the freedom to do it.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:29):**  But we make it very obvious to them that if you do it, it's not good.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:32):**  Right?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:33):**  Try to, these are the recommended ones, right?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:35):**  And they choose from that recommended list.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:37):**  That's extremely interesting and a big education part as well, I can imagine, because most  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:41):**  people wouldn't think about that unless you are in farming, or natural farming.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:45):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:46):**  There are some very interesting features which we are launching in the next couple of months  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:48):**  in the app.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:49):**  So we are trying to gamify, to incentivize users to further right behaviors, right?  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:55):**  So the way we are trying to do this, and this will be so I'm just giving you a sneak peek,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:26:58):**  this will be launched fairly soon, is that as they, so let's say we want to have consumers  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:04):**  come to the farm, because it's beneficial for our business model, it's beneficial for  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:07):**  consumers to see it, right?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:09):**  So it's very important that consumers come to the farm.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:12):**  So how do we incentivize that?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:13):**  So when they come to the farm and they do a check in at the farm, right?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:16):**  We will basically give them some points, right?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:19):**  Similarly, other sort of behaviors as so they can chat with other growers also inside the  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:23):**  app, right?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:24):**  So they can converse with other growers.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:26):**  And we see most people using that to share recipes, etc.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:29):**  Because many people are also discovering new types of vegetables.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:32):**  And they are like, okay, I'm going to plant this, but what can I make out of this, right?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:37):**  So people use that in app chat to share a lot of recipes, etc. with each other and in  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:42):**  general discussions, learning about farming and things like that.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:45):**  So we want to encourage conversations there as well, right?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:47):**  So the idea is that encourage for all of those behaviors, which we want our consumers to  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:52):**  do, which are beneficial for our business and for the community, we will incentivize  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:56):**  them with specific amount of points, right?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:27:58):**  Those karma points or whatever they could redeem for various different interesting things.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:04):**  So we are trying to do a few tie ups with natural and organic farmers on the fruit side  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:09):**  of things, right?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:10):**  So, so the idea is that if you are a very engaged vegetable grower, right, because you  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:14):**  are doing a lot of actions on the app, you're coming to the farm, you're volunteering at  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:17):**  the farm, you might end up accumulating enough points for you to basically buy a bunch of  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:22):**  fruits as well.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:23):**  And those fruits are going to get directly delivered for certain farms, right?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:26):**  These are not going to be in the farmville model that we are doing because you can't  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:28):**  do it for fruits easily, right?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:30):**  Because fruits have a very long, just the same cycle, etc.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:34):**  But what if you could earn these karma points and then redeem them against fruits, right?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:38):**  That's something that we are trying to do.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:40):**  Yeah, to slowly add more of your, more of your daily shopping, coming from something  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:46):**  and you of course partner only with the organic fruit farms, you can actually trace and trust  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:50):**  and are transparent.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:52):**  So I just wanted to take a couple of minutes telling you a bit about the farming methodology  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:28:57):**  that we try to follow, right, the pillars of it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:00):**  So the three or four key pillars of it is, one is instead of adding a lot of compost,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:05):**  etc. from outside, which using industrial compost can be questionable, right?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:11):**  It's great to use home compost.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:13):**  But when you use compost that is being manufactured in a factory, right, there are certain issues  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:17):**  with that, right?  
**[0:29:18-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:18):**  For example, in hot Indian summers, that compost actually decomposes and releases a lot of  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:26):**  carbon dioxide, etc. into the air as well, right?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:28):**  Because we have fairly hot summers and stuff like that.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:32):**  So what we try to do is more of following, put in a lot of mulch once your plants have  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:36):**  grown, that prevents the weeds, that prevents evaporation of water, it gives more shelter  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:40):**  for earthworms, etc. as well.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:43):**  Then on top of that mulch, put microbe solutions and those microbe solutions are not microbe  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:49):**  solutions that you buy from the market, but things which you create at the farm using  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:52):**  ingredients which are available very nearby, right?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:29:55):**  So cows are a very important part of that, because what we use is we use cow dung, cow  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:02):**  urine, we use jaggery, local jaggery to provide the energy for the microbes to multiply, we  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:09):**  use pulse or leguminous flowers, flowers as in like cowpea flower, etc. those to provide  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:16):**  the protein that is required for those microbes to actually do cell division, right?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:21):**  And we use those to create microbe solutions, which then you pour onto the mulch so that  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:25):**  they start decomposing the mulch in situ, right?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:28):**  Rather than adding compost from outside.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:30):**  So that starts forming the top humus layer, for example.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:33):**  The second thing is that these microbes that you introduce to the soil and most of these  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:36):**  microbes die away when you do chemical farming, etc.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:41):**  So when you introduce these microbes into the soil, they form a good relationship with  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:45):**  the plant roots, right?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:46):**  So they help the plants absorb a lot of the minerals which are already there in the soil,  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:51):**  right?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:52):**  Just like microbes in our body, inside our gut help us absorb a lot of the nutrition,  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:57):**  right?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:30:58):**  Similar thing exists with bacteria and plants as well with microbes and plants as well,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:02):**  right?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:03):**  We just try to kind of unlock those sort of things.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:04):**  And in our, the way we plan our farms, etc.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:07):**  We put in a lot of moringa, right, where that's very good for nitrogen fixation, for example,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:13):**  we put in a lot of pulses, etc. as inter crops, right?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:16):**  Those kind of help do again a lot of nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:19):**  So what we are essentially, our philosophy is that nature already knows how to grow things.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:25):**  Let's just give nature a toehold and get out of the way, right?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:28):**  That's what we try to do.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:29):**  So we don't try to add too many different inputs only just as is necessary.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:35):**  When you talk about pest repellents, for example, again, you could use things like neem oil,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:40):**  etc. which you can buy from the market, or you could choose to make some of these insect  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:44):**  repellents, right?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:46):**  A bunch of these insect repellents can be made by crushing leaves of various different  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:50):**  types of plants which are typically available in many farms, right?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:53):**  Or in and around those farms, right?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:31:56):**  So you crush those leaves together, right, make a juice out of it, and then you spray  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:01):**  that on.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:02):**  So we are trying to follow a lot of these indigenous recipes, so to speak, right, from  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:06):**  both the inputs perspective, from microbe solution perspective, as well as from pest  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:10):**  repellent perspective, rather than buying stuff from outside.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:13):**  There are of course some things that you need to buy from the market as well.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:17):**  But the idea is that one is about regenerative agriculture, secondly is about reducing the  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:23):**  reliance of farmers on input companies, right?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:30):**  This sort of agriculture has actually been practiced in India for hundreds and thousands  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:33):**  of years.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:34):**  It's just that in the last 30 or 40 years, we have kind of forgotten about a lot of those  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:39):**  and tried to take systems from outside which were not really meant for our small farm situations.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:45):**  Yeah, you're basically I mean, looking back at the history of farming in India, this last  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:50):**  30 years was a very small bleep in history.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:54):**  And now, hopefully in the next 10, 20, 30 years, you move back with all the technology  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:32:59):**  you have now obviously, to the natural and this gets very close to zero budget farming,  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:04):**  but actually done in a high tech way and done in soil measurements and soil technology that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:10):**  we have now obviously that they probably knew in the time before, but we've lost that sort  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:14):**  of sensitivity to reading the soil.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:16):**  So basically, the way we think about it is that we need to use technology to improve  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:20):**  things etc.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:21):**  But let's also not forget what worked in the past, right and try to combine them together.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:26):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:27):**  And what's your vision in terms I mean, you're building up here, you're adding new partners,  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:31):**  obviously, but what's your long term vision for this company?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:36):**  Is it going beyond vegetables?  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:37):**  Are you going to add maybe at some point, are you going to add fruits?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:40):**  Are you going to go to a more perennial system where trees are part of it?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:43):**  Is there a meat part or dairy?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:47):**  What are your ideas?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:48):**  So I think we definitely want to focus only at this point of time, at least, in the next  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:55):**  couple of years only on the fresh produce side of things, right.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:33:58):**  But there are essentially what we are about is connecting consumers to farmers and making  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:04):**  consumers a part of the production process itself, right.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:07):**  That's essentially what we are trying to do.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:10):**  So the way it actually manifests itself might be different in the mechanics from what we  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:15):**  are doing currently.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:16):**  For example, just to if you consider our current thing about as a real life farm bill, right.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:24):**  Maybe what this could evolve into later on could be for example, a Kickstarter for farming,  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:29):**  right.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:30):**  Let's say grains, right.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:32):**  Let's say we want consumers to be part of the production process of rice, right.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:36):**  Now rice, of course, you need to, you cannot do some of these techniques that we're talking  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:40):**  about or this sort of a model would not work.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:43):**  Maybe the consumers could focus on, you know, let's say the consumers are growing rice in  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:50):**  collaboration with the farmer and they keep monitoring it through our app, right.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:54):**  The farmers similarly have an app which helps them actually manage their farm and stuff  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:57):**  like that.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:58):**  So all of those pieces remain the same.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:34:59):**  The difference being that now that let's say two tons of rice have been created in that  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:04):**  farm, we provide the market linkage part of it, right, and we get the rice to the market.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:10):**  Some of it we deliver to the consumer for his personal use, but the remaining gets sold  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:14):**  and the proceeds get distributed between the farmer and the consumer.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:17):**  And maybe we take a small cut out of that, right.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:19):**  This is one model that this could evolve into if we choose to grow into things beyond fresh  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:24):**  produce, right.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:25):**  Our immediate plans though are for the next couple of years, we just want to get to five  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:29):**  or six cities in India, get to 20,000 subscribers in each city.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:33):**  Also about let's say 100,000 subscribers each paying 40, 50 dollars per month.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:38):**  That's our initial plan, right.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:41):**  Once we get to this, then we'll think of how do we expand into other things.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:45):**  I don't think we will get into meat or dairy, etc.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:50):**  It's a very different business, right.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:51):**  So I don't think we'll get into that.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:53):**  And of course with the size of the market and the size of the issues you mentioned before,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:35:59):**  just in fresh produce there's a lifetime of work to do.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:03):**  So I don't want to distract you, but I'm just interested in the vision.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:06):**  I'm very interested in what you mentioned before on the sort of kick-starting, kick-starter  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:12):**  of farming.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:14):**  New models like that could fix a lot of the issues you mentioned before, take out some  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:19):**  of the incentives, some of the incentives that are really destroying soil, destroying  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:24):**  farmers' lives and of course destroying our health.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:27):**  So that's interesting to hear that there's at least the thought and at some point probably  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:32):**  also the time and resources to do that.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:34):**  So the other interesting thing, because you bring up the dairy, etc. part of it.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:38):**  See, I mean if you talk to folks who work with the environment, etc., right, a lot of  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:45):**  them will have a lot of comments to make on how the dairy industry has played a big role  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:50):**  in destroying our environment, right.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:52):**  So the interesting thing is that at least the sort of agriculture that we used to follow  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:36:57):**  in India and which we are trying to bring back depends a lot on integrated farming using  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:02):**  cows, etc., right, using farm animals to create a lot of the inputs that are required, right,  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:08):**  which goes back to interior soil.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:10):**  So that's what we are trying to do.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:11):**  So maybe there are some aspects, for example, if you have one cow in your farm, right, you  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:17):**  can actually create those microbe solutions, etc., and fertilizers for almost 30 acres  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:23):**  of land, right.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:24):**  So any of these small farmers, we highly recommend that if you have 4 or 5 acres of land, just  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:29):**  keep one cow.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:30):**  That cow is going to give you a lot of inputs in terms of what you use on the soil back  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:35):**  in to enrich it.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:37):**  But you're not having the cow because you want the meat or the milk, but you're having  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:42):**  it because it's part of a farming system, a natural farming system, which is a very  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:47):**  different mindset, obviously, than growing as many cows as possible in a factory and  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:52):**  sell it because of that.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:54):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:55):**  As we're bringing up, I mean, you brought up the Kickstarter, etc., I want to just touch  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:37:59):**  upon for a few seconds on investing and investors and the money side of things.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:07):**  You have raised a seed round, which I have to congratulate you with, obviously, because  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:11):**  I don't think many in the regenerative agriculture space are now in that process or are thinking  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:16):**  or looking, but there are not too many that actually did it.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:19):**  Can you talk a bit about that?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:20):**  How did these discussions with the investors go and were they interested?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:24):**  Obviously, they were because they joined, but were they interested in the model and  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:27):**  how far, how difficult was it to do that?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:31):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:32):**  So I think a couple of things.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:33):**  So when we started talking to investors, etc., I think first was, and we started talking  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:38):**  to investors even before we launched our first farm, right.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:40):**  So obviously, there was initially some hesitation from potential investors that, hey, this sounds  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:46):**  like a very crazy idea.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:48):**  It does not sound like, OK, see in India, a lot of investments happen because there  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:54):**  was, let's say, oh, there is a Uber which succeeded in US.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:38:58):**  So let's do a Uber for India, right.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:01):**  Or there's some other company in US which let's do that same model in India.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:07):**  So a lot of, unfortunately, a lot of investing in India happens based on models which have  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:11):**  worked elsewhere.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:12):**  And this was a very new sort of a model.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:13):**  So there was obviously some hesitation around it.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:15):**  But when we launched our first farm, that got subscribed by with, I think, 79 subscribers  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:21):**  within like a week of launch without doing any marketing, etc., right.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:25):**  So that immediately investors got started, OK, it looks like there is adequate interest  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:29):**  for something like this.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:31):**  The second thing was, is it possible to actually grow?  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:34):**  So there were a lot of hypotheses around production, which we wanted to prove out.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:37):**  Can we actually produce enough food to replace 70, 80 percent of the vegetable requirements  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:42):**  of a small family, right, of a, let's say, a husband, wife and a kid sort of a family?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:47):**  Can you do that through just such small areas?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:49):**  So that we were able to prove that as well.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:51):**  So once these two proof points were there, that there is adequate interest and it's possible  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:39:56):**  to actually do this production, then investors, then folks that we started talking to, they  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:02):**  were a lot more receptive.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:04):**  We ended up, but still we decided to take a smaller round, right.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:10):**  So we raised about 300 K USD and we raised it from one fund, one institutional fund called  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:17):**  Venture Highway, right.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:20):**  And remaining folks are all angels.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:22):**  So it's angels and one institutional fund.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:25):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:26):**  And did many of them, I can imagine, oh, actually, did they visit the farm or was it very different  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:31):**  from what they expected?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:33):**  So people did visit the farm.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:38):**  It was, I think they were quite intrigued to see that, oh, this is actually working,  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:43):**  right.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:44):**  So some of them did visit the farm, some of them did not because they were actually not  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:47):**  in the city, right.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:49):**  Some of them are based from Delhi and we are in Bangalore.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:52):**  Yeah, no, that's it.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:53):**  And I can imagine it's been a while for many probably visiting a farm, especially one that's  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:40:59):**  working and also producing a lot more than the typical small acre farmers.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:05):**  Very interestingly, because obviously we were talking to investors, etc. before launching  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:09):**  the first farm.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:10):**  So out of those 79 subscribers, three of them were VCs.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:13):**  Three of them were folks who work in venture capital farms.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:17):**  Yeah, no, that was going to be my question.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:20):**  I imagine, I mean, any good investor would try the product before they, if it's there,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:24):**  obviously, would try it before making the investment and also just to see in general  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:28):**  if it works.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:29):**  And for the farmers, how can you, I mean, you've been, let's say farmers and soil in  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:34):**  six, seven months into the first farm.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:38):**  What has been the difference for them and for the soil and has it been a steep, I can  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:42):**  imagine a steep learning curve?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:45):**  So I think two or three things.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:46):**  One is that the current farmer at least is making almost four times what he was making  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:51):**  earlier, right.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:52):**  Four to five times.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:53):**  Wow.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:54):**  So that's number one.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:55):**  Number two is that it's predictable, right.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:41:57):**  So it's not depending on whether my crops will succeed.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:00):**  So not only have his returns have become four, five fold, but his risks have become very  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:06):**  minimal, right.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:08):**  The only risk that he faces is that, oh, maybe things don't work out well and maybe subscribers  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:14):**  cancel and there is some time period where not all of my mini farms are sold out.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:20):**  So that's the only risk that he faces, which has not turned out so far.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:24):**  So far that farm has been always completely sold out, etc.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:27):**  So for farmers, it's a big win.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:30):**  Now from the soil perspective, the best example of that we have seen, which kind of tells  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:36):**  us that the soil is becoming much better is that we now see a lot of earthworms in the  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:39):**  soil.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:40):**  Earlier we couldn't find any, right.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:41):**  So this specific farm, what was happening is that this was left uncultivated for some  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:45):**  time.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:47):**  For a couple of years after that millets were being grown in it.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:50):**  So one of the issues, right, and this is something important to talk about as well.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:53):**  I was mentioning that we curate specific types of farmers, etc.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:42:57):**  So ideally we want to work with land which has not been used for some time or things  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:03):**  like millets, etc. have been grown because millets is a very hardy crop.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:06):**  It's a grain crop.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:07):**  It's a very hardy crop.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:08):**  So nobody uses pesticides on them, right.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:10):**  Because we want to use land which is not already ridden with pesticides because it takes quite  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:16):**  some time to go, those pesticides to drain off, etc.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:20):**  So which is why it's important for us to also select the right farmers because if the soil  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:25):**  is already hurt using pesticides, we don't want to expose our consumers to that, right.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:29):**  So ideally it should be land which is not being cultivated right now and just lying  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:33):**  there or maybe you are growing fodder in it.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:36):**  So it's usually lower quality land which we then start enriching, right.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:40):**  And we see a lot of earthworms that have come up into the soil now, right.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:43):**  Now if you dig up into the soil, you'll see a lot of earthworms.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:46):**  So that's one of the like proof points for us.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:48):**  The key indicators.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:50):**  And what does the farmer think of all the people that come now to his farm and see his  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:54):**  farm almost as a, of course as a supermarket, as a way where their food comes from but also  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:43:59):**  as a park?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:00):**  Right.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:01):**  So for him it's actually, it's interesting.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:03):**  Initially he was not used to this, right.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:05):**  Because see from a farmer who was completely focusing on production, now he's somebody  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:11):**  who needs to, he sees somebody coming to the farm, he smiles at him, etc.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:15):**  So initially there was definitely some adjustment period, right, where he had to also learn  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:21):**  that okay folks are going to come visit my farm, right.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:24):**  Because so far it was my farm, I do whatever I do here.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:27):**  So there was definitely an adjustment period around that.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:30):**  But I think after a period of time people, the farmers also start enjoying it because  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:35):**  people start volunteering, right.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:36):**  So there's one of our customers right now.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:39):**  She is a yoga teacher during the early mornings, right.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:41):**  So early morning she would do her personal yoga classes, etc.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:44):**  She would teach at the institute.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:46):**  And then after lunch she would basically come and spend four hours at the farm, right, every  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:52):**  day.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:53):**  Every day other than weekends of course.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:55):**  So like five days a week she would come to the farm, spend four hours not just working  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:44:59):**  on her plot but pretty much volunteering with everything that the farmer is doing, right.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:03):**  So the farmer, that's a great thing.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:04):**  He now knows that when customers come to the farm some of them will probably become volunteers  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:09):**  and will help him with his labor, right.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:11):**  So that dynamic works out well.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:14):**  And just to ask a final question because I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:20):**  I'm always imagining there are a lot of Smart Impact investors listening to this podcast  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:25):**  and they're all ready to get into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:27):**  They've heard it or they're ready to get into minimum input or zero budget or natural  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:32):**  agriculture, whatever stamp we put on it.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:35):**  What would be your advice if you would be talking to Smart, let's hope Smart Impact  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:40):**  investors that want to get into this space, what they should look out for?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:44):**  I think see when impact investors look at things they need to, I think they need to  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:49):**  have a much larger investment horizon, right, or a payback horizon than in other industries,  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:54):**  right.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:55):**  Because very simple things, right.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:45:56):**  Let's say that you are investing in a company which has come up with a very different production  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:00):**  technique, right.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:01):**  It's going to take quite some time.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:03):**  You can't like, you can't tweak your model or you can't pivot your model in a few months  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:07):**  like you can do in other sectors or other businesses, right.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:10):**  So that's something to keep in mind that you probably need to think about your investment  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:14):**  horizons.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:15):**  That's number one.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:16):**  Number two, I guess, I think both India and China are actually very interesting markets  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:21):**  to look at from regenerative agriculture point of view because of a couple of things.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:28):**  One is that the soil quality has been deteriorating rapidly in both of these countries.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:33):**  Second is also the fact that both of these countries are kind of a little trust deficit  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:38):**  streams, right, where consumers don't trust even if something is mentioned as organic  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:44):**  certified etc.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:46):**  Right.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:47):**  So I think a large number of opportunities are coming up around that, right.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:50):**  How do you like build trust by getting consumers connected back to things etc.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:46:56):**  And I think a large number of these opportunities are in India and China right now.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:00):**  That's an extremely interesting point of view.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:02):**  It's definitely and they are two of the biggest markets in the world and in need of so much  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:08):**  and there's so much growth still going on there probably.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:12):**  Hopefully we can avoid some of the mistakes we made here and we went down a bit too far  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:17):**  to the right and maybe or to the left depending on how you look and now you are still at a  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:21):**  crossroad although the situation of course is extremely bad with 25 farmers have committed  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:26):**  suicide actually more since we've been talking but there's still a way to go back to the  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:32):**  agriculture with the new technology that you were doing 30-40 years ago.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:35):**  So the other thing is some of the systems which are available for example if you look  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:40):**  at other countries right if you look at US.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:44):**  In US community supported agriculture in general has been something which has been picking  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:50):**  gathering steam etc. over some time.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:52):**  There are about I think 15,000 farms in US which follow community supported agriculture  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:47:57):**  in general and that's their take in how to do regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:01):**  But I think whenever you are investing in any of these businesses you need to look at  
**[0:48:06-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:06):**  both the farmer side as well as the consumer side.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:08):**  Is there a consumer demand?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:10):**  A and B with the business model can farmers actually operate with that business model  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:15):**  right because farmers in different parts of the world in developed countries etc. might  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:22):**  be a lot more savvy they might be able to do marketing themselves right or if you give  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:26):**  them some tools they might be able to use it and do their own marketing and things like  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:29):**  that right.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:31):**  But the situation is a little different in countries like India right where many of these  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:35):**  farmers are also not very literate.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/21/shameek-chakravarty/#t=0:48:37):**  So that adds a very interesting dimension and when you evaluate in opportunities you

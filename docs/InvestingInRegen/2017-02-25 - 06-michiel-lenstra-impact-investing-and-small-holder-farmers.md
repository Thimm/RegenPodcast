**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:20):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:21):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:05):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:10):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:31):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:41):**  In these interviews, I'm talking to people who are scaling up the sector, either by increasing  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:46):**  the influx of capital or by working on the ground to scale up the enterprises on the  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:50):**  ground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:51):**  Why regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:53):**  Because so many of the world current issues come together in this subject from drought  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:01:56):**  to water scarcity, climate change, social issues, hunger, obesity, all have a connection  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:02):**  to how we grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:05):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Michiel Entstra, partner at the Wire Group  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:09):**  and impact investor, and we'll be talking about the role of smallholder farmers in the  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:13):**  regenerative agriculture revolution.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:15):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:16):**  It's a very warm welcome.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:17):**  I'm your host of today.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:19):**  Today in the podcast, we have Michiel Entstra impact investor and partner at the Wire Group,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:24):**  a group who helps high net worth individuals and families in the Netherlands to move their  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:27):**  capital to impact.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:29):**  And we have a slightly different angle today, looking mostly at the role of smallholder  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:33):**  farmers in the agriculture agriculture transition that we are in.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:36):**  Welcome Michiel.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:37):**  Hello, I'm Koen.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:39):**  So to start off immediately with a personal question, why are you in this space and why  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:45):**  you're doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:46):**  Yeah, to answer that, I think it's good to explain that I'm wearing two hats today, as  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:53):**  you already said, as partner at the Wire Group and as impact investor.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:02:59):**  The work that I do with the Wire Group where we help families to do their impact investments  
**[0:03:09-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:09):**  and the reason for doing that is because I just see an enormous potential for re deploying  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:18):**  capital in much more productive and much more impactful ways.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:22):**  When I was KPMG, I already started seeing this potential and then I decided to make  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:28):**  that a full time full time occupation.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:34):**  When I look at capital and the potential of deploying that in the real economy as opposed  
**[0:03:40-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:40):**  to the kind of more fictional economy of numbers and financial terms as numbers, then I think  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:48):**  that that's enormously valuable.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:55):**  So that's the work that I'm doing with Wire Group.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:03:59):**  The background to all this is when I was doing some work for Philips in Brazil and I was  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:11):**  sitting in my hotel in Brasilia and looking out the window, there were a group of homeless  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:19):**  people sitting in the park that I could see from my room and it was at that point that  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:24):**  I kind of these different streams of thought came together and the intention or the ambition  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:32):**  to kind of help a significant number of people to improve their lives through private markets  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:39):**  kind of came up and the work with Wire Group is kind of flows out of that.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:46):**  In addition, I'm also an impact investor myself and the focus that I've chosen for that is  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:04:56):**  agriculture.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:01):**  Again this starts quite a few years back when I was doing at KPMG a number of projects in  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:07):**  the agriculture space.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:08):**  We were doing calculations of the costs and benefits of making a transition of value change  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:16):**  agriculture value change to more sustainable value change and that kind of brought me in  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:23):**  touch with the whole smallholder theme that I became increasingly interested in and I  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:31):**  think for me this is really where kind of the environmental challenges that we face  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:39):**  and the social challenges that we face come together in a very unique way.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:47):**  So why smallholder farmers?  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:52):**  Why was that part of the sector of the agriculture sector so interesting to you?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:05:58):**  Like I said the potential for impact there is to my mind just really incredible because  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:10):**  while at KPMG we were doing these calculations of like I said the costs and benefits of transitioning  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:17):**  the sector.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:19):**  It was very clear in those calculations that with quite minor changes in how these farmers  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:28):**  work their agricultural practices or their access to particular inputs or what have you  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:35):**  that quite minor changes had such a huge impact on their income for example on their productivity  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:44):**  and their income.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:45):**  So I really saw that potential and the more I started looking into it the more I realized  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:06:52):**  that so many different themes that I care about at least come together there.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:01):**  If you consider that about 65% of the world poor are either farmers or the family of farmers  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:10):**  and you realize that 75% of the people that are hungry in this world are also living in  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:15):**  rural areas and therefore also directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:23):**  And then you look at the environmental side of things and you realize that about depending  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:29):**  on the figures you look at but nearly 30% of greenhouse gases come from agriculture,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:35):**  80-90% of water is used in agriculture.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:38):**  The list goes on and on.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:41):**  So really for me agriculture is at the heart of the social and environmental challenges  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:07:52):**  that we face today and within that the smallholder really represents both the challenges because  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:00):**  they face enormous challenges.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:02):**  If you look at the kind of life of an average smallholder farmer it's really quite daunting  
**[0:08:10-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:10):**  to see what kind of reality they face but also in terms of the potential.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:22):**  So again some statistics suggesting that smallholder farmers as a group and there's about 500  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:32):**  billion of them so there are an enormous number of them but as a group they can increase their  
**[0:08:38-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:38):**  productivity by 50-60% and obviously these are kind of quite broad stroke figures but  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:46):**  I think the message is clear that there's an enormous potential which looking at the  
**[0:08:53-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:08:53):**  potential for contributing to food security for example the question of how do we feed  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:03):**  the billions of people on earth by 2050 that is constantly raised I think smallholders  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:09):**  hold the key to answering that question.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:12):**  Yeah they really seem to be at the crossroad of many many movements and especially I mean  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:20):**  with 500 million the social angle is extremely important and it's extremely sad that most  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:26):**  poor people are farmers and most undernourished people are also farmers which of course should  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:33):**  be completely different so if you look at it from an angle from the social perspective  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:39):**  in a smallholder farmers at regenerative agriculture what do you think are a few logical steps  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:45):**  that should happen if we look five or even ten years I mean agriculture is a long-term  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:50):**  play 15-20 years from now where do you see movements and would you like to see movements  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:55):**  going?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:09:59):**  Well I think again it's a story of challenge and opportunity and the challenge is as I  
**[0:10:10-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:10):**  see it to unlock that potential that is there you know for farmers to become much more productive  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:25):**  in all senses of the word which also translates then to a much more stable and much more higher  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:33):**  level of income and thereby also contribute to the food security question so to unlock  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:41):**  that potential while at the same time not repeating many of the mistakes that have been  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:47):**  made in agriculture over the last decades whereby you know the earth has just been taken  
**[0:10:55-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:10:55):**  as a receptacle for the crops that we want to grow you have the soil you put in some  
**[0:11:04-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:04):**  chemical inputs and a seed and then you harvest the crop and you repeat that year after year  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:13):**  not really paying any attention to the health of the soil so if we you know unlock that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:21):**  potential of smallholder farmers but go down that road that we have gone down before then  
**[0:11:28-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:28):**  I think it's not the win-win opportunity that I think exists in the smallholder farmer space.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:41):**  So it's really balancing not making the same mistakes we have made or in hindsight when  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:45):**  we made them of course they were very logical steps we took but in hindsight we learned  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:51):**  a lot of things and hopefully we can prevent another big group of farmers from making the  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:56):**  same mistakes.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah and that's obviously difficult because it is very hard to ask from somebody who is  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:09):**  very poor and who has an opportunity to improve their situation to say okay you know but we  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:17):**  would like you to do it in such and such a way so that you know you're not repeating  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:22):**  the mistakes that we've made before and that you save our earth.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:27):**  It's kind of a parallel to the climate change discussion where you know we've put all these  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:33):**  climate gases into the atmosphere and now we're asking developing economies to say okay  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:39):**  well there's too much climate gas in the atmosphere can you stay in place.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:45):**  Yeah so it's a similar discussion but I think kind of paradigmatically we need to change  
**[0:12:57-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:12:57):**  that discussion and realize and I think many smallholder farmers realize that anyway whether  
**[0:13:07-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:07):**  it's explicitly or implicitly that the ecosystem services that are provided are essential to  
**[0:13:17-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:17):**  their success and in some ways maybe even more so than it is for the larger scale farmers  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:27):**  in more developed economies because simply said smallholder farmers just don't have the  
**[0:13:34-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:34):**  means the financial means to replace ecosystem services whether it's organic material or  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:45):**  nutrition for the crops or whether it's pest management or water etc.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:53):**  They just don't have you know the money to invest to replace those ecosystem services  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:13:57):**  which are provided in a healthy ecosystem.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:02):**  So I think if we look at it from that mindset then the two actually go hand in hand.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:13):**  Yeah and they have to because what gives us the right to tell somebody to not develop  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:18):**  in a certain way actually nothing probably gives us the right to do that but if it fits  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:23):**  into the most logical steps and hopefully we can make it in such a way and we with local  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:30):**  farmers that the only way or the only logical way forward is the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:37):**  the sustainable agriculture or ecological agriculture or whatever stamp we put on it  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:44):**  but yeah we can't ask anybody to make a sacrifice like that especially if you're a smaller farmer  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:49):**  that literally lives from one season to the next and please don't put this fertilizer  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:14:55):**  because it's bad from five years from now which is incredibly arrogant thing to say.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:00):**  Yeah absolutely and again the good news is that empirical studies have shown that it's  
**[0:15:10-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:10):**  not a zero-sum game in the sense that productivity growth and regeneration or kind of ecologically  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:22):**  centered agriculture kind of are mutually exclusive.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:27):**  In fact they're not and studies have shown that you can have significant productivity  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:32):**  increase through ecosystem centric farming practices so I mean I think that's definitely  
**[0:15:40-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:40):**  very encouraging and I think the interesting challenge is how do we kind of put that into  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:15:52):**  practice as we scale solutions for smallholder farming.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:00):**  How can we embed that kind of ecosystem centric farming into the products and services that  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:08):**  I think are the key to smallholder farmers reaching their potential because I mean I  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:13):**  think you know we can talk about that more in a minute but I think that's where I see  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:20):**  a real gap at the moment for reaching that potential the lack of appropriate products  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:29):**  and services geared to smallholders.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah because you've been looking at this sector for quite a bit you've been investing in it  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:37):**  you've been working on agriculture also from the perspective of at the wire group so what  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:44):**  have you been seeing the gap you just mentioned can you explain a bit more about that and  
**[0:16:48-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:48):**  maybe one or two examples of companies or solutions that are trying to fill that gap.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah I mean I think the first thing to kind of realize and understand is that smallholder  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:05):**  farmers are not farmers by choice most of the time they're just they're farmers by legacy  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:10):**  because their families their forefathers were farmers and that's you know that's what they  
**[0:17:17-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:17):**  were born into and they're working the land but it's really a hand to mouth existence  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:28):**  they're subsistence farmers.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:31):**  So I think that that's an important point to start from and if you start from that then  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:38):**  you can also start to kind of understand that you know many smallholder farmers don't want  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:45):**  to be on the farm they actually want to move to the urban areas and seek out different  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:50):**  opportunities.  
**[0:17:51-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:17:51):**  On the other hand there will be farmers smallholder farmers who do want to be in farming but then  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:00):**  probably not under the conditions that they are doing it right now and I think what stands  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:05):**  between the conditions within which they're doing it right now that subsistence hand to  
**[0:18:10-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:10):**  mouth existence is it comes from a number of gaps in the marketplace which means that  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:24):**  smallholder farmers just have very limited access to the market and that you know shows  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:30):**  itself in different ways whether it's access to the market for land, access to the market  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:38):**  for knowledge and technology, whether it's access to the financial markets or access  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:46):**  to the actual you know product markets.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:49):**  Many farmers smallholder farmers don't know don't have a good idea of what price they  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:18:54):**  should be asking for their produce and actually end up underselling which you know is to their  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:01):**  to the detriment of their income so I think there's a lot of struggle to enter markets  
**[0:19:10-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:10):**  and I think that gap can be filled by innovative approaches by companies that are providing  
**[0:19:23-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:23):**  products and services that make those linkages and you asked about examples so one of the  
**[0:19:31-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:31):**  companies that you and I have both invested in is Landmap and Landmap is a Dutch company  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:41):**  that works with farmers in initially Ghana but they have plans to go to other countries  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:47):**  but initially Ghana they're working with farmers to literally map out their land because  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:19:54):**  most land entitlement in Ghana and many other countries is based on customary practices  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:02):**  so there are you know understandings about who has what land but it's not documented  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:08):**  and it's not official which makes these farmers very vulnerable because if a government official  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:14):**  or chief comes along and says hey you know this land is mine they don't really have  
**[0:20:19-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:19):**  any recourse and it also makes it harder for them to invest in their land because of that  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:28):**  risk and also issues around kind of how do you pass land on from one generation to the  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:34):**  next so this company is using some you know not very pioneering technology but using it  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:41):**  in a pioneering way namely to use GPS to map out the land and then they have a whole process  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:48):**  whereby they get to earn that digital map of the land into an official title for the  
**[0:20:54-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:20:54):**  land which then helps them get access to things like credit and maybe you know in time can  
**[0:21:04-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:04):**  also help stimulate a market for agricultural land whereby those farmers that don't want  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:12):**  to be farmers they can sell or lease their land to those farmers that do want to be and  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:19):**  give those farmers that are wanting to be farming and wanting to be entrepreneurial  
**[0:21:24-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:24):**  in doing that to expand the land that they manage and work on a slightly bigger scale  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:37):**  not to say that scale is everything but at least it allows some more flexibility in how  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:45):**  they operate.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:47):**  Yeah I think it's an excellent example of really to start at the bottom of the pyramid  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:21:55):**  in this case cocoa farmers in Ghana that are among the poorest of the poorest while we  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:01):**  are paying a really hefty sum for our chocolate bar so there's something in the value chain  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:07):**  that has to change and hopefully it starts with land ownership and land titles.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:12):**  Yeah one of the other challenges like I said is access to knowledge and to technology because  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:22):**  most of the smallholder farming is very labor intensive which on the one hand I think can  
**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:29):**  be seen as a positive thing in the sense that it supports local jobs but in more and more  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:37):**  rural economies the reality is actually that there is an increasing shortage of labor or  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:43):**  that labor is becoming more and more expensive particularly when you get on a seasonal basis  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:50):**  because a lot of people are moving off the land and into the cities and also because  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:22:55):**  of the aging of the population of the rural population this manual labor is actually becoming  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:03):**  more scarce and more expensive which leaves the farmers that are dependent on that with  
**[0:23:09-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:09):**  another challenge namely how do I work the land and make that economically viable.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:18):**  Another company that I've looked at is Hello Tractor.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:25):**  They are setting up in Nigeria to provide tractor services so they sell tractors which  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:34):**  are GPS enabled.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:37):**  They sell them to small entrepreneurs who in turn rent out the tractor on a job by job  
**[0:23:45-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:45):**  basis so that the farmers can get access to this technology which on its own is not affordable  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:23:55):**  for a single farmer to put up the capital for a tractor even if it is a small low horsepower  
**[0:24:03-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:03):**  tractor but it gives them access to the services of the tractor and thereby able to work their  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:12):**  land much more efficiently and also to much lower cost.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:17):**  So those are just a couple of examples of companies that are coming up and entering  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:24):**  this smallholder market.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:30):**  An extremely interesting example from another angle and if you look at, we bring it to a  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:37):**  bit more, this was already extremely practical but if you look at your work in the past year,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:45):**  you both had your own impact investing and also as partners the wire group.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:49):**  If you look a year ago and until now what has changed in the sector, in your work, what  
**[0:24:55-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:24:55):**  has kept you busy and what are you happy that you basically concluded maybe as we are approaching  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:04):**  initially the end of the year?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:07):**  So let me take the two strands then from a wire group perspective, a huge amount has  
**[0:25:15-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:15):**  changed over the last year simply because we have seen amongst our client base an interest  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:25):**  to kind of start putting up more capital and moving more capital into the impact investing  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:31):**  space but at the same time not really knowing how to deploy that and with wire group that's  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:39):**  the role that we are taking to kind of do the hand holding and provide the services  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:46):**  around making the impact investments.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:25:51):**  So that's I think, I mean obviously the figures are there from the work that Jin and JP Morgan  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:01):**  are doing yearly so they are showing the yearly growth in impact investing but for me personally  
**[0:26:06-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:06):**  it's really great to see that kind of translated very concretely into our client base over  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:16):**  the past year.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:17):**  So that's very exciting and then from an investment point of view I think, yeah I mean  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:29):**  I just gave those two examples, I think there are more examples.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:32):**  I think there has been a realization and this is going back definitely more than a year  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:39):**  but in the past kind of five years or so there's been a realization in lots of different levels  
**[0:26:46-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:46):**  of society from the UN down to the international NGOs but also I think within impact investing  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:26:56):**  there's been a realization that there is this promise of the smallholder farmers and that  
**[0:27:01-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:01):**  is now translating into an increasing number of opportunities in that field because we  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:12):**  also have to be realistic and understand that this is also a very difficult market.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:19):**  I mean the market of selling products and services to smallholders is possibly one of  
**[0:27:25-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:25):**  the most difficult markets to be in because as we've said the smallholders are poor, they  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:34):**  don't have a very high level of professionalization, they're not used to buying products and services,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:42):**  they're obviously incredibly geographically dispersed often in very not very densely populated  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:52):**  areas so distribution is an issue.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:27:57):**  Their incomes even when they do have an income are extremely volatile living from harvest  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:05):**  to harvest.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:06):**  So I think we also have to be very realistic that this is a very difficult market to be  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:12):**  in and despite that there are now an increasing number of initiatives and companies and also  
**[0:28:20-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:20):**  funds that are focusing on this so I think personally again that is exciting and very  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:29):**  positive.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah it seems like the space is waking up and offering more and more ways to, still  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:37):**  it's very early on, but to put money to work in this sector and that's a good thing because  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:42):**  without that we cannot really move capital into the space.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:48):**  And when you, let's take it to a year from now, what will have changed in your work with  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:28:55):**  both hats and what would you like to have seen changing with your work in the next 12  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:02):**  months?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:03):**  I think from a wire group point of view what I would like to see in a year time is that  
**[0:29:11-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:11):**  the approach that we are taking with wire group which is basically one around building  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:19):**  impact investing portfolios whereby we look both at kind of a finance first perspective  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:28):**  whereby we say investing in impact doesn't necessarily have to mean that you're compromising  
**[0:29:34-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:34):**  on financial returns, that the realization is amongst our client base is growing that  
**[0:29:42-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:42):**  that is possible, but on the other hand there's also room for investing from a more theory  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:50):**  of change kind of approach so that people really dig into a particular theme that's  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:29:57):**  important and close to them and invest in that with a view to developing a particular  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:05):**  theme or a particular sector and building that up and building up the ecosystem that's  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:10):**  necessary around that.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:11):**  So with wire group we've just done a paper, we've written a paper on agriculture and food  
**[0:30:22-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:22):**  so that's just one example of a theme that we've looked at and I think and others will  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:30):**  follow and I think that that approach to impact investing is very necessary and very important  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:36):**  and that's also the approach that I take from my personal point of view so you know  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:44):**  it's about the individual investments but it's also about the ecosystem that is building  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:51):**  up because you need you know and that's obviously not for single investors always to realize  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:30:58):**  that or to make that happen but as long as you're taking that perspective of building  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:03):**  the ecosystem of company services, NGOs etc that are contributing to a particular theory  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:13):**  of change.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:16):**  So in short what I would like to see in a year's time is that in wire group we get our  
**[0:31:23-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:23):**  clients to awaken or awaken but realize this dual approach of you know finance first portfolio  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:32):**  building and also venturing into a particular theory of change and then from the small agriculture  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:39):**  I'm just looking forward to seeing more and more development in that space and seeing  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:47):**  that ecosystem of products and services building further and further.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:52):**  And then I think if we take we look at more from I mean you use your personal hat as an  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:31:59):**  impact investor obviously what do you see as the two most important barriers we already  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:05):**  discussed this in at the beginning what are for you personally the two most important  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:11):**  barriers to make impact investments in regenerative agriculture with a more smallholder farmer  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:17):**  angle?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:19):**  Yeah I mean I go back to what I said earlier which is the I think the real barrier to making  
**[0:32:26-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:26):**  this work is to ensure that the productivity improvement and the development of smallholder  
**[0:32:39-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:39):**  farmers occurs in lockstep with an environmental perspective which has a clear understanding  
**[0:32:50-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:50):**  and a clear appreciation of the ecosystem context within which that occurs and on a  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:32:59):**  very practical level that means that companies like Hello Tractor which are selling these  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:06):**  tractor services to smallholder farmers that they take that approach and I think to some  
**[0:33:12-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:12):**  extent they do so for example they are already have an attachment to the tractor with which  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:21):**  they can do seed drilling which in turn enables no till or low till agriculture which you  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:28):**  know from a soil perspective is obviously much better.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:32):**  So it is possible but it is important and necessary that all those companies that are  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:41):**  providing these products and services definitely have a very genuine and authentic commitment  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:49):**  to that ecosystem-centric approach.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:33:54):**  So that's one barrier or challenge that I see and on the other hand I think I mean I've  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:03):**  just described kind of this energy that is being generated around smallholder farmers  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:12):**  and that translating into new initiatives which I think is positive but I think there's  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:19):**  also a risk that because there's also a lot of interest among the UN and the NGOs etc.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:26):**  in this sector one of the concerns that I have is that at one point large amounts of  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:37):**  institutional grant funding start going into this sector I mean or obviously already a  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:42):**  lot of money is going into it but if that is to scale up and all these organizations  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:47):**  are working in isolation to come up with you know new projects and they don't deploy that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:34:55):**  money in a way that's supportive of the kind of grassroots initiatives that are coming  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:02):**  up then I think there's a risk that those grassroots initiatives will suffer from that  
**[0:35:08-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:08):**  because they won't have access to that money and that money is going into the projects  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:18):**  that have been selected by these organizations rather than supporting that sector development.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:25):**  So I think those are two kind of areas that are a challenge.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:32):**  Yeah we should try to somehow also get that grant money in an impact investing format  
**[0:35:40-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:40):**  or to invest it at least with those classes on because otherwise it could really disrupt  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:48):**  the sector as we've seen actually in other sectors as well.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:35:51):**  Yeah I mean I think the key to it is to take the smallholder perspective which or maybe  
**[0:36:02-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:02):**  put another way to empower the smallholder to make his or her own choices and to spend  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:12):**  their money on the products and services that they see as a best match for what they need  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:19):**  rather than you know design a project for developing smallholder farmers on paper and  
**[0:36:26-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:26):**  then kind of imposing that on the smallholder farmers so you know maybe in some sense the  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:34):**  best thing to do would be to just you know whatever grant money is available to just  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:39):**  give that to the smallholders and then you know from there that will really kind of create  
**[0:36:44-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:44):**  a boost in demand for products and services specifically geared towards smallholders and  
**[0:36:52-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:36:52):**  then you actually get a very powerful boost rather than working counterproductively.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:00):**  Yeah I think that's an excellent point and also a great point to finish this interview  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:04):**  and I would like to thank you for your time and I think we'll be definitely checking in  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:09):**  with you in less than a year from now to see and to hear hopefully many more examples of  
**[0:37:16-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:16):**  ways to invest into smallholder farmers with an ecological angle and to make sure that  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:24):**  for many generations to come farmers are not the ones that are malnutrition mostly and  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:30):**  are the poorest of the poorest.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:37:34):**  Absolutely thank you for giving me the opportunity to share this.

**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:39:15):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:39:19):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:39:24):**  and recording this podcast since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:22):**  No.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:23):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:25):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:31):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:35):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:40):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:43):**  Thank you.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:44):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:45):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:52):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:54):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:40:59):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:04):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:09):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:10):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:15):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:19):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:24):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:25):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:27):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:29):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:33):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/michiel-lenstra/#t=0:41:35):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

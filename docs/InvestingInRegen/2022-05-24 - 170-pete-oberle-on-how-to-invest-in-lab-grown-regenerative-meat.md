**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:13):**  A check-in interview with Pete Overlie, the managing partner of Trailhead Capital on his  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:17):**  journey into the food and egg space and the latest investments made by the fund.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:23):**  Among them a regenerative, cultivated lab-grown meat company which should help regenerative  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:27):**  farmers 20 or even 100 eggs their protein output.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:31):**  Does that make you cringe or very interested?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:34):**  We unpack it all in this interview.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:38):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:43):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:47):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:53):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:00:58):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:00):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:04):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:08):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:13):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:16):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so

**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome to another interview today with the managing partner of Trailhead Capital.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome Pete.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:48):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:49):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:51):**  And thank you so much for joining us on this late or early hour depending on how you look  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:56):**  at it.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:57):**  But I'm very interested.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:01:58):**  We've interviewed your two of your other co-founders and managing partners which obviously we'll  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:03):**  link below in the interviews.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:04):**  But as a fund, as a first time fund in this space and one of the few funds in the space,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:09):**  obviously there's a lot to discuss because you've been making investments.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:12):**  But we'll get to that in a minute.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:14):**  I would love to start with the personal question we always start with.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:17):**  How did you end up in this space and focusing so much on soil regeneration and then ending  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:22):**  up setting up one of the first VC funds in the space here?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:28):**  Great question.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:29):**  Really, you know, I got into it from a human health perspective.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:33):**  You know, my background, I was trying to play football for far too long.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:38):**  You know, in the process it motivated me to optimize human performance.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:44):**  But it also led to a lot of injuries and too many surgeries.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:47):**  Just American football, soccer.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:49):**  What are we talking about here?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:50):**  Yeah, American football.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:51):**  Global level.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:52):**  American football.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:53):**  OK.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:54):**  Which I think gets more injuries almost than soccer or not?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:55):**  Is it?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:56):**  It's quite a top sport, right?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:02:59):**  Both fairly injury prone, but a few more contact injuries in American football.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:06):**  So you and how did you discover food then as a I wouldn't say as a medicine because  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:10):**  let's not go there yet.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:11):**  But as a is that a thing in American football, that food, what you're eating and is that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:17):**  important?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:18):**  And then how would you describe, let's say, the current thinking or the current general  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:22):**  thinking in American football around food?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah, no, that's a great question.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:27):**  I probably am a little out of date in terms of how American football specifically is thinking  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:32):**  about it.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:33):**  But at the time and I mean, of course, this was the eye opener.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:37):**  You know, I mean, this is going back to the 80s and 90s when I was playing.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:42):**  And really, we were taught to focus on macro nutrients and essentially cut fats out of  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:48):**  our diet.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:49):**  So at the time, there was very little known or consideration given to that food.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:03:54):**  But really, the evolution for me was, you know, I had gotten well, I mean, background  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:03):**  there was going from, you know, those surgeries, I basically got out of college got into investment  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:10):**  banking, I went into the life sciences group because I was focused on regenerative cartilage.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:14):**  I got exposed to Ag bio companies at the time.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:18):**  Ultimately, went back to business school joined a private equity fund.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:23):**  But along the way, where diet came back into the picture and a better understanding of  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:29):**  the importance of the quality food was, was I was introduced to the paleo diet.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:34):**  This is about 2011.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:35):**  So quite a shift from not including fats to paleo.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:39):**  Just this as a background paleo.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:41):**  What is paleo the diet just for people that are thinking, yeah, I heard about it, but  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:44):**  they don't really know what it is.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:46):**  Like, how would you describe it?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:48):**  Yeah, broadly, it is.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:51):**  Well, they would tell you no grains, no dairy, no legumes, and avoid processed foods while  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:04:59):**  focusing on good healthy fats, including animal fats, nuts, etc.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:04):**  But you know, of course, the more you look into that, you understand some of the nuances  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:09):**  to those grains and to that dairy.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:11):**  So when you get into the ancient grains, I mean, basically, the premise for paleo is  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:16):**  avoiding the inflammation and leaky gut that some of those inflammatory foods can cause.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:22):**  So if you get to ancient grains that are a little bit more historically agreeable with  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:28):**  the human digestive system, then you can avoid some of the ramifications of that.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:32):**  So it's basically taking us back to what we think, which is very debatable, and for many  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:38):**  sides, what we used to eat before we started agriculture or before I started agriculture,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:43):**  before we stopped being mostly hunter getter, etc.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:46):**  But did you still remember how because you when you first hear that and you've always  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:52):**  been taught that fat is bad, etc.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:54):**  Like, did it hit you immediately like, Oh, this is interesting, or was there resistance  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:58):**  first?  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:05:59):**  Like, do you still remember when the first time you I wouldn't say saw paleo, but the  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:03):**  first time you took it seriously?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:04):**  What was your response there?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah, total skepticism.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:09):**  It didn't make any sense to me.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:11):**  It was like, you know, okay, everything you're telling me is pretty much the opposite of  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:15):**  what I've been taught my entire life.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:17):**  But truthfully, at the time, I was working for a private equity fund in Japan, the Fukushima  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:22):**  meltdown and earthquake and tsunami had just happened.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:25):**  And so I think we were in a space where we were willing to explore and just searching  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:31):**  for answers and things to kind of take our mind off of what just happened there.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:36):**  But you know, so yeah, I doubted it very, very strongly.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:42):**  But you know, as a result, I had to try it and turned into a little bit of a biohacker  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:47):**  in the process.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:48):**  So basically, you know, to prove it out was getting essentially monthly blood tests to  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:53):**  track my biomarkers.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:06:54):**  And, you know, not surprisingly, basically, everything improved significantly.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:01):**  So you remember that first time when you saw those biomarkers and you were like, you were  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:05):**  sure maybe you already felt better, but that you were sure this was not going to work.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:10):**  Did you feel better the first time you did the blood test?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:12):**  Because then maybe you had a hunch like, okay, this might be a bit not what I expected.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:17):**  Or like, how was that process?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:19):**  You know, actually, that's a great question.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:21):**  I mean, going back to how did I feel?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:23):**  Like, you know, thinking about the process, it took a few weeks for the body to adapt.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:29):**  Well, in even the taste buds, you know, taking out some of those sugary foods, but, you know,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:33):**  within a matter of weeks, it kind of felt like my mouth was reprogrammed and otherwise  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:38):**  bitter or plain foods were, you know, so much richer.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:43):**  So I've had some hopes, but still some skepticism.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:46):**  But when I started getting those results back, it was hard to argue with.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:50):**  I wasn't in a terrible condition, but it was noticeable enough to be able to attribute  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:56):**  it directly to dietary changes.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:07:59):**  So yeah, I mean, that was what really opened up the rabbit hole for me.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:04):**  So I started paying attention to ingredients and foods, realized how hard it was at the  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:10):**  time.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:11):**  And of course, this is just 11 years ago, to really understand the quality of the ingredients.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:15):**  I basically had to start at just a level where there wasn't bad stuff in there.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:20):**  There wasn't stuff I didn't understand.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:22):**  But necessarily, you know, I was still operating in that private equity fund, but decided to  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:27):**  start angel investing in the space.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:29):**  That started with some high end CPG companies, but really wanted to start getting closer  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:36):**  and closer to the source.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:37):**  So started investing in human gut microbiome companies and gave me a better idea of the  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:42):**  causes and ramifications of inflation, inflammation, and ultimately took that back to the source  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:49):**  and started looking directly at ag opportunities, both in land and tech.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:08:55):**  So really, I continued doing that, left private equity, took a year off, really wanted to  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:02):**  give some thought to how I could better contribute to the world and in the process saw firsthand  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:09):**  how badly the environment needed so much help.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:13):**  You know, unfortunately, at the time, I was exposed to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:17):**  I mean, it just became so blatantly obvious about the importance of soil health in improving  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:24):**  human and planetary health.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:25):**  So that's an interesting, it's an interesting step beyond, let's go back to our ancient  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:32):**  diet.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:33):**  And of course, we can discuss like what we used to eat 20, 30, 40,000 years ago.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:38):**  It's not the same meat, it's not the same grain, it's not the same, etc.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:42):**  And but I've also seen many people simply saying paleo, okay, I need to eat a lot of  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:46):**  animal protein, no legumes, no this, that, but not going the step beyond thinking, okay,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:52):**  how does this meat was grown?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:53):**  Like what this did?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:54):**  What did this cow ate, or etc, etc.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:09:57):**  So do you remember, because it's not so obvious that this turns into a rabbit hole, it could  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:02):**  be simply stopping there, like, okay, I don't do processed food anymore.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:05):**  I don't do grains.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:06):**  I do a lot of animal protein, and I feel a lot better regardless of where this comes  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:09):**  from.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:10):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:11):**  And that's it.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:12):**  And but no, you took it a few steps further, and actually way further than that.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:15):**  Do you remember?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:16):**  Was it just simply you being curious?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:17):**  Or were you already aware like, oh, this could be quite an energy intensive way of eating  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:22):**  if we feeding it grain and corn and soy?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:25):**  Or was it an environmental question?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:27):**  Like, like, why?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:28):**  Why did you keep digging into at the end into the soil?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:32):**  Yeah, you know, it was a combination of things looking back on it.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:40):**  There was, well, there was the trigger that was that was set off in just that.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:46):**  I mean, what I mentioned before, when you basically turn the information you've been  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:52):**  schooled in on its head and have better outcomes through it.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:10:56):**  So it just yeah, that definitely triggered in me a desire to explore and understand more  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:02):**  and really start to question everything.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:05):**  But yeah, I think in terms of environment, it also, well, it raised somewhat of an inherent  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:12):**  conflict in me just trying to understand.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:15):**  So okay, well, first of all, qualify, I certainly appreciate paleo diet, there are a million  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:20):**  diets out there for a reason.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:22):**  I mean, there's a lot of different heritages and evolutions populations over time.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:27):**  So it doesn't necessarily work for everybody.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:30):**  But that said, assuming this approach works for a variety of people, like, is that really  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:36):**  telling us that we need to ramp up production and consumption of meat?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:42):**  And can this world really sustain that?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:44):**  So yeah, it triggered in me the desire to look into meat production, better understand  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:49):**  that and, you know, of course, it's crazy when you start to dive down that rabbit hole,  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:56):**  right?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:11:57):**  How little we know how disconnected we are from the food system.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:00):**  So really starting to learn what a gainful operation is really like.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:06):**  Obviously it's eye opening and disheartening.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:08):**  So do you still want to eat that even if it's better than yeah, whatever factory bread you  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:14):**  were eating or etc?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:16):**  Yeah, that's an interesting question.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:18):**  I mean, yeah, we try to often not to see that or prefer not to see that.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:23):**  But unless now at the moment you see it, you cannot unsee it anymore.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:26):**  And then you have to act.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:27):**  Otherwise, yeah, it would just be a very, very big conflict in your head.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:31):**  Well, and I'm sure you know all too well, there's a very conscious effort to hide that  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:36):**  from the public facing aspect.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:40):**  And you know, most of those packaging, there is a happy cow in the pasture somewhere.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:46):**  On the packaging, at least.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:48):**  So yeah, it was I mean, a large part of it was trying to understand, okay, this, this  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:54):**  approach is clearly working for me.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:12:56):**  And if this is what the vast or, you know, a significant portion of the population historically  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:03):**  followed, then, you know, how does that possibly work?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:08):**  Because it did inherently make sense to me that, you know, relying on the intelligence  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:13):**  of nature is the right thing to do.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:15):**  So and that production piece, like feeding the world is something that people are like,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:20):**  yeah, but how, how we're gonna feed the world in this?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:23):**  Like, you've done the analysis, you've looked into this, what is your normal response?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:26):**  Like at a dinner party?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:27):**  I don't know if you only have friends that are into region ag and food, but let's say  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:30):**  you meet somebody that isn't or like, yeah, that's all sounds great, Pete, but how we're  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:35):**  gonna feed the world?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:36):**  Like, what is your response?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:37):**  I'm not looking for the answer here, because it's extremely complex.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:41):**  But how do you respond to that normally without scaring away like all the dinner party guests?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:45):**  With a two hour deep dive into production numbers and complexifying agroforestry, silver  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:51):**  pasture, etc.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:52):**  Like, what's your, I'm looking for, I'm asking for a friend, like, I'm looking for a few  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:13:57):**  sentences here or an interesting story that can trigger an interesting conversation about  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:02):**  feeding the world.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:03):**  What's your natural response there?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:05):**  My natural response these days, I mean, of course, there are a lot of questions and nuances  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:09):**  to scaling regenerative agriculture, but, you know, also qualify when you consider trailhead  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:16):**  and our focus, we focus on on farm opportunities, supply chain opportunities, and consumer related  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:22):**  opportunities.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:23):**  I happen to focus on the supply chain.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:25):**  So when that question is posed that that that you suggested, you know, how do we feed the  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:30):**  world?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:31):**  I say, you know, feeding the world is not the problem.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:35):**  You know, 800 million people go to bed hungry every night.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:38):**  That's 10 percent of the population.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:40):**  We waste 30 to 40 percent of the food that we produce.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:45):**  So really, I think first and foremost, that is where we need to focus a lot of our attention  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:50):**  in terms of just improving the efficiency and reducing the waste in our system.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:56):**  I think that's a good one.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:14:57):**  Plus, I think that two billion people are overweight or, let's say, consuming more calories  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:05):**  than they have to.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:07):**  And so it seems mostly a distribution problem if we purely look at calories and not at the  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:11):**  quality of calories, which we definitely should look at.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:13):**  But it's not that we don't produce enough food now and we're still not feeding the world  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:17):**  because 10 percent goes to bed hungry and 20 percent goes to bed overeating, which in  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:24):**  many different ways, I'm not saying it's their fault, but it's the food system we created  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:27):**  is not feeding us.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:29):**  And so we better figure out a solution there.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:32):**  So how did you then end up saying you started making angel investments, you mentioned.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:36):**  Yeah, some people set up a fund at some point, some people don't.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:40):**  What was the step there to say, OK, we need a bigger organization and more an institute  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:46):**  basically to start doing these kind of investments at a larger scale in the region, like in food  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:51):**  space.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:52):**  And it's not enough if I'm investing my own my own money into a number of angel deals  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:57):**  a year.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:15:58):**  When you see that opportunity, like what was there like this?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:01):**  This is actually more than a side thing.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:04):**  This could be the main thing.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:06):**  You know, it kind of came knocking on my door.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:10):**  I had left private equity, made the decision to focus on angel investing in this space  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:14):**  full time.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:16):**  But luckily, reconnected with Trip, who's actually a longtime friend.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:22):**  And we started comparing notes.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:23):**  And this is in 2019.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:25):**  And he was at the time specifically looking for a couple of partners to raise and launch  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:30):**  a regenerative agriculture fund with him and Bobby, our fourth partner, who I don't think  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:35):**  you've spoken to yet.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:37):**  So we appreciate that.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:43):**  So the more we talked about it, while of course, angel investing was intriguing to me, I also  
**[0:16:48-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:48):**  came to appreciate the challenges of adding value and the need for a broader scale approach,  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:16:58):**  just better understanding the complexity of the food and ag system.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:02):**  The more I talked about it with Trip and started to discuss it with the other partners, you  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:08):**  know, we were able to piece together a vision that was comprehensive and connected some  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:14):**  of the disparate pieces in that mission to improve some of the challenges of the current  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:19):**  food and ag system.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:20):**  So yeah, the stars aligned in that regard.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:23):**  And at the time, it just made sense to form a fund together, particularly given the different  
**[0:17:28-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:28):**  skill sets and experiences and networks each one of us are bringing because there was fortunately  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:37):**  relatively little crossover with each of those.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:41):**  And just for the people that didn't listen to the previous interviews, which again, I  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:44):**  will link below with Mark and with Trip, in a few sentences, what is Trailhead?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:49):**  I mean, it didn't change a lot, I think, except that you made more investments.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:54):**  But in a few sentences, it's always nice to hear from another partner as well how you  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:57):**  would describe Trailhead and where you're at.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:17:59):**  We're now talking end of Q1 2022.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:03):**  So end of March, beginning of April, when this will be out, I mean, depending when you  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:06):**  listen to this.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:07):**  So where, how would you describe Trailhead now?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:10):**  Somebody asks you, what is Trailhead to you?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah, really, in just a couple sentences, Trailhead is a venture capital fund investing  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:19):**  in early stage regenerative ag and food companies that improve soil health either directly or  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:26):**  indirectly.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:27):**  They also increase profitability for the regenerative farmer while improving access and affordability  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:35):**  for the regenerative consumer.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:37):**  So as you may have gathered from the conversation thus far, certainly consider ourselves mission  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:43):**  driven as we truly believe regenerative agriculture presents the greatest opportunity for improving  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:49):**  human and planetary health.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:18:52):**  We believe that opportunity necessarily provides for market returns for better and while we're  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:01):**  investing in inherently impact oriented companies.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:05):**  So interesting discussion with Mark on a conversation with Mark discussion sounds so heavy on the  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:11):**  if there was tension between regeneration and hunting for unicorns, which I think I  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:15):**  called the episode and he gave a very interesting answer that I've since repeated many times.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:19):**  Like he said, maybe eventually not if we've regenerated enough land, enough people, enough  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:24):**  communities, enough companies, et cetera.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:27):**  But there is a window now where he feels, and I think you agree, where there are definitely  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:32):**  opportunities for outsize returns because let's say we're so far below zero that there's  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:37):**  so much to do that there is the potential growth rate or the potential curve of just  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:43):**  soil carbon levels or nutrient deficits, et cetera, is so large that there are opportunities  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:50):**  for outsize returns, even though those returns are maybe a lot higher than let's say an old  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:55):**  growth forest can sustain, which maybe is like 3% people have calculated.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:19:59):**  So there's an interesting moment there.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:01):**  We're so far below that there might be interesting moments for unicorns, although some people  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:06):**  might think, oh, unicorns and region ag, should that or region ag and food, should that even  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:10):**  be possible, et cetera.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:11):**  So I like the tension there.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:13):**  How do you see you're saying outsize returns or venture capital returns when investors ask  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:18):**  that question?  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:19):**  Do you have another answer to that?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:20):**  Like what do you tell them when they put on that skeptical face?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:25):**  Yeah, they, well, I think we tell them and it necessarily needs to be addressed more  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:32):**  often than I would have thought in that necessarily saying it's impact oriented.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:39):**  I think investors in our fund or in the market generally think that comes with concessionary  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:44):**  returns.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:45):**  But you would think that we've tackled that with, I don't know, even beyond Berger or  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:52):**  Tesla.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:53):**  I mean, there are some interesting with all the debate around them, but some interesting  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:57):**  impacts returns.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:20:58):**  I mean, if you were early in that, you made some Oatly as well, some interesting runs,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:06):**  let's say.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:07):**  Do you feel that skepticism when you have been going out into the market?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:11):**  You know, I think it may not be skepticism, but it warrants addressing and explaining  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:17):**  that because this is impact oriented, it is not concessionary.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:22):**  It is, yeah, I think the explanation and putting it in perspective is yeah, because of the  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:29):**  outsized opportunity and improving human planetary health, we expect outsized returns.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:35):**  But yeah, look at the food and ag venture capital investment spectrum historically.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:43):**  And really, we consider a lot of the investments that we're participating in food tech or ag  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:48):**  tech, but with a regenerative filter layered in there.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:52):**  So if you look at that market historically, that's right, ag tech and food tech combined  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:21:57):**  up until about 2020 had somewhere around eight unicorns historically, eight exits over a  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:05):**  billion dollars.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:06):**  But in the last few years, those have accelerated rapidly.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:11):**  You know, historically, a lot of the companies were acquired in relatively early stages by  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:15):**  some of the big strategic players to take them off the market or simply because they  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:20):**  didn't have the luxury of venture investing in the first place, because that was historically  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:26):**  about 2% of the capital contributed to early stage startups, because historically, food  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:32):**  and ag companies took longer to develop and more capital to develop.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:37):**  So it wasn't as compelling a venture capital investment.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:42):**  But we're at a point where consumer demand and awareness is significant enough and tech  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:48):**  has improved enough that both of those factors together can accelerate that timeline and  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:54):**  provide for those outsized returns.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:22:57):**  And let's talk about the portfolio, like what investments have you made recently?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:04):**  What are some exciting ones we can share?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:08):**  I mean, they're on the website, your portfolio is on the website.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:10):**  So we're not disclosing any secrets here or scoops or news, but I still would like to  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:15):**  unpack a few of them.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:18):**  What investments, let's say also in your part of the investment theme, have you been mostly  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:22):**  excited about?  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:23):**  Most excited about?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:24):**  Yeah, I would say so really, since you last talked to one of my partners, we've been making  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:34):**  investments in what were that address waste reduction, traceability, transparency, carbon  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:41):**  markets and regenerative meat.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:44):**  So you know, as I mentioned, really, I focus on the supply chain.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:47):**  And broadly, to me, that means trying to improve efficiency and connectivity in the regen system.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:53):**  So we see that minimizing the role of middleman, enabling decentralization and reducing some  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:23:59):**  of the waste that we talked about, because yeah, bottom line, we want to increase that  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:03):**  8% of the price that's going to the farmer.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:07):**  To try and move the ball in the right direction for all of those characteristics, well, one  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:15):**  of the investments we made and great companies we partnered with was FoodMaven.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:20):**  So not sure if you've heard of or seen the FoodMaven before, but they made a bit of a  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:26):**  pivot and really now provide better tracking and pricing for food items, including those  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:32):**  that are regeneratively sourced.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:33):**  So they do this by having restaurants and other institutional food buyers download a  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:38):**  browser extension.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:39):**  They're able to see real time prices across a broad district of their network and in the  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:44):**  process select for a regen characteristics.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:47):**  So they've also partnered with Google to help build out the internet of food that Google  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:24:54):**  Food for Good has proposed, which is really addressing one of the major issues with the  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:01):**  food system.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:02):**  It's just disparate and disconnected.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:04):**  So that effort, really through some of the technology and software that FoodMaven provides,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:12):**  enables better transparency into the various nodes in the system and therefore better connectivity.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:18):**  So yeah, we love FoodMaven for a lot of reasons, but one in particular is the ability to increase  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:24):**  awareness and demand for regeneratively produced food.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:28):**  Which is something you see as an opportunity or something that's still lacking in terms  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:33):**  of it's great to have many more farmers in transition, but if nobody buys it or nobody  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:38):**  knows it's there and it goes into the standard, even the standard organic commodity markets,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:44):**  if you would be certified, we sort of lose that potential for storytelling, for premiums,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:50):**  for food as medicine, for nutrient density.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:52):**  Like we lose all of that because it just goes into the big pile.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:25:56):**  It seems like you've been making investments specifically to tackle that, to decommodify  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:01):**  these, which is not really a word I found out actually, but I've been using it, decommodify  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:05):**  the supply chains or the supply webs.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:08):**  Yeah, that's exactly right.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:11):**  I mean, certainly more regenerative food needs to be produced.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:16):**  But yeah, I mean, for one of the elements that FoodMaven addresses that I didn't even  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:21):**  touch on is basically they automate aggregation of food items, which is, you know, if you  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:27):**  really understand that, it's surprisingly hard because it's very manual because a lot  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:34):**  of the time you may have 20 or more names for the same food item.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:37):**  So they've collected enough data points that they can kind of automate that and piece that  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:42):**  all together.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:43):**  But what that process has prevented has been appropriate labeling of regenerative or even  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:51):**  organic food items.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:53):**  So appropriate value has been hard to ascribe to those actual food items.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:26:58):**  So this goes a long way in helping appreciation for food items produced in that manner.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:03):**  And I mean, of course, in this case, they are not investing, I mean, they're investing  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:08):**  in technology, but it's not that they have to build enormous factory.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:11):**  So there is potential there that your investment dollars go a bit further than if you have  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:16):**  to set up a massive robotics factory or something like that.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:21):**  In that theme of transparency and getting more dollars to or shifting, let's say the  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:26):**  food dollar spend, have you made other investments that are, of course, they're all exciting,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:31):**  but other investments that we have to talk about?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:35):**  Probably we have made other investments that are worth talking about.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:41):**  And you know, I mean, there's a few that we can touch on.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:44):**  Right.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:45):**  Food making falls into that software category.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:48):**  We've made another software investment company by the name of Swarm Engineering.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:52):**  I mean, essentially they're democratizing AI to find supply chain solutions for food  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:57):**  and ag companies.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:27:58):**  So really helping them to optimize efficiency, but also enabling them to solve for sustainability  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:05):**  characteristics in the process.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:06):**  Because when you say Swarm Engineering, it sounds like a robotics company, but it's maybe  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:11):**  just my thinking about swarms.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:14):**  But it's not the case.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:15):**  So how would you describe that as a what's a use case for Swarm Engineering?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:19):**  What's a typical client?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:20):**  So yeah, a typical client.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:23):**  Let's say it could be, yeah, I don't want to disclose specifics of who their customers  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:30):**  are.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:31):**  I think, you know, is it a supermarket?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:34):**  Is it a restaurant chain?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:35):**  Is it a hospital?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:36):**  Is it a private person like me?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:38):**  It is typically a, it could be a conventional ag company.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:42):**  It could be a big brand name company, you know, food and ag company as well.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:48):**  And basically, they may be using Swarm Engineering.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:28:53):**  So basically, Swarm provides this library of algorithms that they develop or aggregate  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:00):**  and basically apply to food ag companies after they fill out an interactive questionnaire.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:06):**  So some of the use cases for that would be really solving for a proper blending of inputs,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:13):**  really balancing resource management and routing appropriately, but also layering on sustainability  
**[0:29:21-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:21):**  metrics, or also enabling better selection of sustainably or regeneratively produced  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:29):**  ingredients in the formation of a product.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:32):**  So in some ways, it's really on the recipe blending side of food processing, not in a  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:40):**  bad way.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:41):**  Most food is blends, most food are mixed and figuring out better or different mixtures.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:49):**  There is the blending aspect and better mixtures component to it.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:54):**  There is the logistics component.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:29:56):**  There is, and some of that logistics is appropriately routing some of that regeneratively produced  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:03):**  food.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:04):**  In some ways, it's a bit of an extension to what Howgood offers, which you've looked at  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:12):**  and talked about before.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:13):**  But that being a sustainability database, you can appreciate what certain food items  
**[0:30:18-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:18):**  do in terms of moving a product from degenerative to sustainable to regenerative.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:26):**  This really enables the company that's putting that product together to help find that product  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:32):**  or find that ingredient and get it to the source so that that product can be made.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:38):**  You mentioned regenerative meat.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:40):**  Let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:41):**  What's the investment you've made in that space?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:47):**  What is regenerative meat in this case?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:49):**  In this case, it is a cultivated regenerative meat company.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:30:55):**  Broadly, we recognize regenerative meat faces some real challenges in scaling.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:01):**  And Omeat represents a much better alternative to capo meat until it does.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:08):**  Really what Omeat is bringing is a very compelling technology.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:12):**  It enables cost parity with the current options out there because it's got a growth medium  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:16):**  that reduces the cost 99%.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:19):**  They partner with regenerative ranchers by placing bioreactors on the farm to couple  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:24):**  with the land and really provide them an additional income stream.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:29):**  It increases the output of regenerative cow by 20 to 100 times and replicates the regenerative  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:38):**  nutrient density of a regenerative cow.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:42):**  Checking the boxes of improving farmer outcomes, scaling regenerative meat in one way, localizing  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:47):**  the system and reducing negative externalities.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:52):**  It is a code.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:53):**  Okay, let's unpack that one a bit.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:31:55):**  I would say many people probably would say, oh, cellular ag or cultivated meat.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:00):**  I can see them cringe basically, although this is a podcast.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:03):**  And what you're saying, we're doing this localized working with the regenerative ranchers and  
**[0:32:08-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:08):**  basically taking a cow that has all the nutrient density, has been on pasture, his or her mostly,  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:17):**  most of it live and use that as the input.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:20):**  Because that's always the discussion in these.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:21):**  What are the growth mediums?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:22):**  What's the input?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:23):**  What's the energy costs?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:24):**  How are we going to build these massive facilities that we've never done before at this scale?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:30):**  The only thing time we've done it is at medicine facilities, but they're much smaller.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:34):**  And you're saying we're taking a much more decentralized approach and using as input,  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:39):**  the regeneratively grown, if that's even a thing, the regeneratively grown towards regeneratively  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:44):**  grown cow as an input and sort of 20 or 100 X that in terms of protein output, which sounds  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:51):**  very interesting.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:52):**  Is nobody else working on that?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:54):**  Is that like, Oh, me, this seems, is that a, I've never heard about it.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:32:57):**  Is that an exception there to take that partly farmer approach almost to, to cultivate it  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:03):**  meat?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:04):**  Yeah, we think it's unique and that's exactly why we like it so much.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:09):**  And I think that is a proprietary process.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:13):**  You say it's a transition or yeah, it's a, it's a, until it scales enough, but this could  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:17):**  also be, this could also be the scale.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:19):**  Like do you see this as a temporary solution as an end solution potentially, or how do  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:26):**  you see this in, in let's say the scaling of regenerative meat production or pastures  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:30):**  and such.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:31):**  The regenerative meat production, we absolutely support and want to scale, but I, you know,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:39):**  recognize and even if that increases tenfold, that gets to 10% of the market.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:44):**  So that's going to take a long time and we're going to further the development of that in  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:50):**  the process.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:51):**  But in the meantime, this does present a potential alternative for conventional incumbents to  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:33:58):**  replace actual KPO meat.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:02):**  You know, and as a result, in the spirit of being a bridge builder and working with some  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:08):**  conventional ag companies at one end and regenerative companies at another, there are some conventional  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:15):**  participants that are looking to be involved here and actually start to use this product  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:21):**  when it is ready for market.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:22):**  So yeah, we're encouraged that this could be.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:25):**  How far is this for, for market?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:27):**  Like how, when can I eat this?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:29):**  Depending on where I am obviously.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:31):**  It's early stage.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:32):**  It's going to be a few years.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:34):**  Well I should say it's early, I should say, sorry, it's going to be a few years before  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:39):**  it fully scales.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:41):**  But of course there are samples and beef ready already.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:45):**  Just not at a commercial scale yet.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:48):**  And you mentioned it holds that niche and density that we're known at that actually  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:54):**  draw you to the space to begin with of the pasture raised and proper pasture mixture,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:34:59):**  holistic management, etc, etc.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:00):**  Of mob grazed, whatever we want to call it.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:03):**  So have you seen that under, I wouldn't say under microscope, but like have there been  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:07):**  lab tests showing that what comes out of these bio reactors compared to, I'm always saying,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:14):**  almost saying the standard one, but there's no standard here, but against the bio reactors  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:18):**  of the ones that let's say don't pay any attention to the input of where the cells come from.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:24):**  Have we seen differences there already?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:26):**  Like can we see those nutrient differences or is it too early for that?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:30):**  So you can.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:31):**  You can look at those and we did discuss that.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:34):**  As you can imagine, this warranted some healthy debate internally.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:41):**  So well, yeah, hopefully this is not too proprietary and you can cut it out if it is at the end.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:47):**  So really, yeah, basically all the inputs, the cells, the growth medium, the scaffolding  
**[0:35:51-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:51):**  are all directly taken from the cow in really what is a minimally invasive biopsy.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:35:59):**  So basically you get the molecular, cellular, DNA and nutrient density level that's more  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:04):**  or less identical to the meat from the cow.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:07):**  That's been tested and that's what the results have shown.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:10):**  Wow.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:11):**  And how difficult is it for, because I see these, it's interesting because we've had  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:17):**  not on a podcast, but we had a company present a tonic actually on decentralized insect growing  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:23):**  to keep it at a farmer's level, to make sure we don't have to transport all of the inputs  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:31):**  and outputs because there's a lot of fertilizer coming out, good fertilizer, not the chemical  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:35):**  one where we pay certain countries.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:37):**  But there's a lot of moving around of stuff, but then always the question is, okay, it  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:41):**  doesn't make sense to centralize it in a big facility where you control everything, but  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:44):**  you also have the risk of infections and the whole thing goes down or does it make sense  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:48):**  to decentralize?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:50):**  But then you're not on top of it constantly.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:53):**  How difficult is it to run?  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:55):**  Will it be to run like a bio-reactor like this?  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:36:57):**  Is that, does an average rancher need to get a biomedical degree or bioengineering degree  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:03):**  to be able to run this?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:05):**  Is this remotely?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:06):**  Like how tricky is this to do this decentralized?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:09):**  Because it sounds super nice, but I'm also thinking, yeah, what if something goes wrong  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:12):**  and it's a long drive to replace something or to go and check, you lose the whole fat  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:18):**  basically of bio-reactor.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:20):**  What's the scale level needed to keep this running and to make sure that the other protein  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:24):**  comes out on the other end?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:26):**  It's still going to be a significant facility and it's going to be selective ranches that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:31):**  make sense for it, but it's not going to necessarily be the rancher who's running it.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:36):**  The company is going to be on site facilitating that.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:39):**  They've got a team and the leading scientist in the world in the space leading that effort.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:45):**  So really they're going to be the ones addressing that.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:50):**  So why is it then to do it on site?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:53):**  Is it that easy access to the growth mediums to the cows?  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:58):**  Do you need that?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:37:59):**  Or is it mostly to add revenue to the farmer?  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:04):**  What's the driver of this decentralization?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:07):**  Do you need to be close to the source?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:09):**  Is that helpful in this case?  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:11):**  I have no idea if freshness is important here or not.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:13):**  Is that a thing or otherwise you have to transport a cow with a lot of stress to a facility seven  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:17):**  hours down the road?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:18):**  I mean, I can imagine that's not the point.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:20):**  Or what's the proximity here?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:23):**  Why does it matter so much?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:25):**  Being close to the source is a major driver.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:28):**  But of course, being able to partner with the rancher and necessarily being able to  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:33):**  focus on regenerative ranchers is certainly an added benefit.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:38):**  And how do they respond to this?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:39):**  I can imagine the cringe on their face.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:41):**  Like, yeah, we're going to place a bio director and that's going to need some convincing,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:46):**  I think.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:47):**  Or do they click quickly and get on board with weekend 20x or 100x your work, basically,  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:53):**  your work on the protein side, not your work, obviously, on restoring the land, because  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:38:57):**  there you still need the animal footprint.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:00):**  But we can sort of there's a multiple here that you don't see because otherwise you have  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:05):**  to do 20x your herd, which is definitely needed, but not so easy to do.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:10):**  No, very good question.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:13):**  Very important one and certainly one we thought about.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:15):**  I mean, as we were going through the diligence process, we called up, I mean, really, even  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:21):**  before we made the investment, we were working hard to work with the team and see what we  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:27):**  could do to, of course, build our confidence and conviction, but also help them further  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:33):**  their plans.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:34):**  And so in the process, made a lot of calls to ranchers.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:37):**  And I don't want to speak out of turn, but it would be some names that you recognize  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:41):**  and people you probably know.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:44):**  So significant regenerative ranchers and they were very receptive to it.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:48):**  And so we're having conversations with the company now.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:51):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:39:52):**  I mean, you would require some explaining and to your investors probably as well.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:01):**  And so, OK, I think we very interesting to follow this and other ones that you're excited  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:07):**  about.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:08):**  Are things you're still missing?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:09):**  Let's say if you look at a portfolio overview, like I would love to have a company because  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:15):**  we're really missing, I don't know, a remote sensing one.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:18):**  I'm just the first word that popped into my mind.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:20):**  Like what's like what would be nice from a portfolio level to still to still have as  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:25):**  you're obviously going to make quite a few more investments and then follow up investments  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:29):**  over the next years?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:30):**  Sure.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:31):**  I would say one of those categories that I particularly would like to fill is a fintech  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:38):**  company.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:39):**  And, you know, fintech come in a variety of forms.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:42):**  But broadly speaking, a company that falls in that space, we've looked at a number, haven't  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:48):**  quite got there yet, are talking to a few now.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:52):**  So are optimistic that happens soon.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:40:55):**  And really to focus on economies for the farmer or what fintech, what should it address?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:01):**  Like really significantly move the needle for the business side of the farmer and the  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:07):**  rancher?  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:08):**  Is that what you're looking at?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:09):**  Because I think there's a lot of space to improve there for sure.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:11):**  For sure.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:12):**  For sure.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:13):**  I think it's improving access to financing options in one way.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:18):**  So it could be, you know, of course, you've had Dan from Stuart on a few times.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:22):**  You know, I mean, of course, they're a terrific example of exactly the kind of fintech company  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:28):**  we look at.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:29):**  But you didn't invest, right?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:30):**  We did not.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:31):**  I know you, you are in.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:33):**  Congratulations.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:34):**  We're very, very, just for this very small investor Dan let us in.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:38):**  But yeah, it's been, we didn't set any terms.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:41):**  Let's say it's a few thousand, but I'm very happy to be part of the journey because yeah,  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:45):**  I hope it will be more honestly, but it's such a crucial and such an underappreciated  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:51):**  and neglected space.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:52):**  Like how to get more, not VC money, also that, but more quote unquote boring money into the  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:58):**  space loans, et cetera.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:41:59):**  And banks are just not there to provide it for people that want to grow.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:03):**  And that's right.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:04):**  I think we see some opportunities there where, right, I mean, the banks have not evolved.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:09):**  They're still incredibly opaque.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:11):**  And, you know, it takes forever to actually get a loan approved.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:14):**  So any, anything that's really helping to improve financing options for farmers is a  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:21):**  big step in the right direction there.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:24):**  And there are a lot of opportunities out there.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:26):**  So no doubt you've seen a few financing platforms and yeah, a few that unfortunately Trailhead  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:31):**  was just not off the ground just yet to invest in those companies.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:36):**  So there will be more, there will be more, but yeah, no, it's a massive space.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:40):**  There's so much refinancing needed.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:42):**  There's so much, and it's so difficult to get, to get loans or to get, I mean, not even  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:49):**  the time, but it takes, it takes forever.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:51):**  If you even get it.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:52):**  And it just, it just really stales an industry that wants to, wants to grow and can grow  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:56):**  and wants to meet consumer demand.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:42:58):**  And yeah, it's just not there.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:00):**  And, or the solutions are not there, but the money is out there.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:04):**  So yeah, those bridge builders are crucial and very interesting.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:07):**  I wouldn't have expected you mentioned FinTech, but it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:12):**  I mean, I think it's a good example of, well, in some of the ways I think about, you know,  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:18):**  VC and food and ag right now.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:23):**  The rest of VC can be leading examples of some of what's to expect in the space.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:29):**  And food and ag is just somewhat lagging in that.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:33):**  You know, which is understandable given the inherent points of friction, you know, and  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:38):**  you just can't iterate on a daily basis and instead essentially have annual harvests that  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:43):**  require things to move a little bit more slowly.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:46):**  But again, that's accelerating and you can see where FinTech for the broader world has  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:52):**  gone in the last 10 years.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:53):**  And you can see a lot of potential for that in the food and ag space to come.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:43:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:00):**  Great.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:01):**  And let's shift gears a bit to a few questions I always like to ask, not necessarily at the  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:06):**  end, but in this case, where are you contrarian?  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:09):**  We've touched upon a few points, definitely inspired by John Kemp, this question.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:13):**  So where do you when you go to RFSI, I always mix up the Regenerative Food System Investment  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:20):**  Forum, which is going to be in Colorado actually in October.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:24):**  So or go please.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:25):**  We might be there.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:26):**  Not sure yet.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:27):**  But when you are there and you're with, let's say, the bubble of regen investments, where  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:32):**  do you think fundamentally different?  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:34):**  Yeah, I think trying to be the bridge builders that we are.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:40):**  The only way to be a contrarian point of view is that big ag will be part of the solution.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:45):**  It's hard to fight those incumbents when they have such a vast amount of capital and resources  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:50):**  and really feel there are benefits to swinging them in the right direction by offering them  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:56):**  some creative expansion opportunities.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:44:59):**  But of course, we're seeing it now, you also have to establish standards and hold them  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:04):**  to them.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:05):**  So that is one area that feels like a bit of a contrarian point of view.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:13):**  Also would say that innovative food and ag capital doesn't need to be concessionary.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:19):**  And that doesn't mean it's extractive.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:21):**  We've probably covered that.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:23):**  But I think, yeah, again, doesn't hurt to repeat it.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:28):**  Perhaps the reminder is needed.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:32):**  But the dots aren't always connected there.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:36):**  Basically, mission driven venture capital really should be win-win-win.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:40):**  If you're investing in businesses that are necessarily impact oriented, VCs or minority  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:46):**  shareholders and everybody's incentives are mission aligned.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:51):**  From my perspective, that means you just got to ensure you've got patient capital.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:45:55):**  So we've been very conscious about pursuing LPs who are mission aligned and appreciate  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:01):**  the timelines.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:03):**  But again, longer timelines shouldn't mean any compromises on returns.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:09):**  I mean, I think some of the best investments ever are long term holds.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:14):**  I've heard like in the case of Google, John Doerr never sold.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:17):**  And you can imagine what that is.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:18):**  And take Sequoia, for example, just established an Evergreen fund for longer hold periods.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:24):**  So yeah.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:25):**  This opens a whole rabbit hole.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:28):**  Are we going?  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:29):**  Yeah, we're going.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:30):**  There we go.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:31):**  So what do you, I mean, there's a question there obviously on the Evergreen structure,  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:36):**  which is not the current fund structure.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:38):**  Is that something you are thinking about for like next funds?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:43):**  As I know, if this fund is successful, and probably it will, this is not, I mean, you  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:48):**  don't stop here.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:49):**  Like, is it something you're, I'm not saying planning, because you're definitely not planning,  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:52):**  but thinking about, okay, what would a fund to look like?  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:46:56):**  And is Evergreen then something or a longer period fund, something you are interested  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:03):**  in or potentially exploring?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:06):**  It has been a consideration.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:08):**  I think when we got things off the ground, we didn't want to complicate them any more  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:14):**  than necessary, just pretty much with standard terms and structure.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:19):**  So it's certainly a consideration in the future.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:22):**  I mean, in an ideal scenario, I kind of like the concept of a Berkshire Athaway, where  
**[0:47:28-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:28):**  you can accumulate a portfolio of companies and partnerships that, where we could be perhaps  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:41):**  a little bit more value add and active in those efforts.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:45):**  I think you take the case of Berkshire, where they're clearly passive, but they do provide  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:50):**  some network benefits there.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:52):**  But yeah, with that structure, yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:47:56):**  I think you have some aggregation of resources and network effects and yeah, really the intention  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:03):**  to hold those forever.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:04):**  So there's some appeal to that.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:07):**  But then to your question about, you know, future funds and how, how at least I'm thinking  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:12):**  about this and we're comparing notes on this internally on a daily basis.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:16):**  Well, I wouldn't say daily, but on a regular basis.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:20):**  Are the LPs ready for that?  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:22):**  Like potentially, like that's, is there enough interest potentially?  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:26):**  I mean, it will be a few years before you do that.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:29):**  Like, do you see like there's, would it be possible to raise a 50 million like you're  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:34):**  doing now or five zero or more?  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:37):**  Like is this, or is it mostly we need in this, we need to stay in the lanes, at least in  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:43):**  terms of fund structures to be able to raise enough to put it to work as we have 10 years  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:47):**  left or nine years or whatever the number is to make, make a dent?  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:52):**  Yeah, I think it, I mean, if the consideration is an evergreen fund or some other kind of  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:48:58):**  structure, it's a conversation to be had when that additional fundraising starts.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:03):**  And yeah, since we were still wrapping up the first fundraise, that conversation is  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:07):**  going to be down the road, but it's certainly a consideration.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:10):**  I think the intention for the next fund would be, yeah, very much in the lane and very consistent  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:18):**  with what we were pursuing at this point, but necessarily a bit larger fund so we can  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:23):**  expand the ecosystem, community and.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:25):**  A double, you always have to double the second one, right?  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:28):**  That's the two X's to double.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:29):**  And so what if we took that away and you actually tomorrow morning, which is in a few hours  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:34):**  only for you, I'm very sorry for this late call.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:37):**  And we're going to, I'm going to be conscious of your time and wrap up soon.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:40):**  But what if you be in charge of a billion dollar fund and it could be an holding structure  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:44):**  or like you don't have LPs, you won an enormous lottery.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:48):**  You have to invest it though.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:49):**  There's one condition, but a timeline could be, or horizon could be extremely long, extremely  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:54):**  short.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:55):**  But where would you prioritize this?  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:49:57):**  Where would you put that to work in the food and X sector?  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:01):**  If the food and X sector, maybe you put it somewhere else and maybe nuclear fusion.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:05):**  But what would you focus on mostly?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:07):**  I don't need the exact dollar amounts, obviously.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:09):**  I just need, what are your top sectors or sub themes you would, you would put money  
**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:14):**  to work if resources were sort of unlimited?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:17):**  You know, I think it would be a bit of an expansion of what we just started to touch  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:21):**  on.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:23):**  First, that similar early stage, but larger fund.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:28):**  But yeah, it would be a few different pockets of capital because again, a few different  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:32):**  pockets are needed from our perspective to address all the opportunities and needs within  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:38):**  the food and ag system.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:39):**  So another one would be a land and infrastructure fund, which is necessarily a different risk  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:46):**  and return profile.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:48):**  I'd want to add a pool for something like Mad Ag's Perennial Fund for progressive transition  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:54):**  financing.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:50:55):**  And then maybe something like what Stephen Orenreiner is doing at Grounded Capital.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:01):**  Basically a fund for moving aspiring, well-sized, well-established companies and food brands  
**[0:51:08-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:08):**  to move along the curve from conventional to reach ed.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:11):**  I think that's needed and momentum worth building on.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:15):**  But maybe that's not all of the money and you got to put a little bit of a pocket fund  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:19):**  for just policy and education.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:24):**  Lobbying is probably the highest potential investment, but it's not something we covered  
**[0:51:30-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:30):**  a lot.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:31):**  We will do a few interviews on that.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:33):**  It's not my favorite topic.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:36):**  But it's so important.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:38):**  But yeah, not the most sexy subject to talk about.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:42):**  And as a final question, if you had a magic wand and you had one, you could do it at once  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:48):**  only and don't start like I would do three, et cetera, just one.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:52):**  What would you change in the space or in the sector or globally?  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:55):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:51:56):**  I've said before, better taste buds or global consciousness or everybody's meditating.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:01):**  I mean, it could be literally anything.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:03):**  What would you use your magic wand for?  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:06):**  Just one.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:07):**  Yeah, venture capitalists always want to make multiple bets, et cetera.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:13):**  In this case, you just have one.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:16):**  I think that's going to have to be a tax on negative externalities like greenhouse gases.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:23):**  So yeah, broadly speaking, certainly wary of any revenue distortion there.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:33):**  But I think that's got to be the one option or one string to pull.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:42):**  I mean, there are a few others.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:43):**  I mean, if the one could be waived, there are a few other thoughts on where wishes could  
**[0:52:50-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:50):**  be spent.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:51):**  But yeah, I think that's the one that's a tough one to answer.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:54):**  We have to start paying for externalities.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:52:57):**  It feels like we're moving slowly in that direction.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:00):**  Of course, we're going to have an endless debate about carbon equivalent, which is way  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:05):**  too simplistic, or CO2 equivalent, sorry, and other things.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:09):**  But at least let's start somewhere.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:11):**  You cannot on a finite planet treat it like it's an infinite waste dump like we're doing  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:17):**  now basically.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:18):**  And that has to stop.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:20):**  There's no way around it.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:23):**  Certainly agree with that.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:24):**  And as we're talking through it a little bit, I mean, another wand to be waived, but very  
**[0:53:30-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:30):**  much in line with this.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:32):**  I mean, now that you mentioned it is really, you know, could food be priced based on nutrient  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:37):**  density?  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:38):**  So, certainly appreciate what Dan Kittredge is doing there.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:41):**  But you know, if that nutrient density is in line, it is inherently incorporating better  
**[0:53:46-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:46):**  soil practices and better use of that land.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:49):**  Did you see the paper coming out of David Montgomery, or Montgomery, sorry, and Anne?  
**[0:53:54-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:54):**  I had not yet.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:56):**  That's a, I will put it in the show notes.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:53:57):**  So, they published the paper recently, a few weeks ago.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:01):**  And I think it's part of their upcoming book.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:04):**  And I hope because he already mentioned it when we interviewed him many years ago that  
**[0:54:07-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:07):**  they're working on a book on nutrient density.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:09):**  And they've shown a very significant connection between soil practices, so farming practices,  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:17):**  agriculture practices and nutrient density between conventional organic and farms that  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:22):**  have been on a regenerative journey for I think, at least 15 years.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:25):**  And they looked at beef, pork, a number of grains and a number of vegetables, and very  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:31):**  small sample size that we shouldn't get all too excited about it.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:34):**  But it feels like a sort of watershed moment.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:36):**  Like it feels like there's somebody that did a proper, a team of researchers, obviously,  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:40):**  it wasn't just David, but to show that connection between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:46):**  gut.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:47):**  The next level is healthy gut and healthy people, but at least let's show the healthy  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:49):**  produce side.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:51):**  And there were significant differences even between higher end organic meat like beef.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:54:56):**  And I think that they looked at the gate at the gate Brown's farm, and the regenerative  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:01):**  grown or the, let's say the pastures that have been on a long journey, they could show  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:06):**  significant differences, which is interesting, because we go sort of everybody, the higher  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:10):**  end organic and then but it could still be higher end organic soil and corn that has  
**[0:55:14-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:14):**  been fed to these cows.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:16):**  And it just doesn't show in I mean, coming back to the earlier discussion on beef, it  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:21):**  just it just shows in the end result, which is very, very interesting.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:25):**  So I hope we're going to see a lot more research.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:27):**  But this seems like quite a significant milestone in let's say the nutrient density space.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:33):**  So I will put a paper below.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:34):**  It's super readable.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:35):**  I read it, which means it is readable.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:37):**  And we hope to have David, obviously, David and Ann on the show soon to unpack this and  
**[0:55:43-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:43):**  where that research is going.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:45):**  Terrific.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:46):**  And I think that's there's also a perfect end to to this conversation.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:50):**  And I want to keep you any any longer because it's very late.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:54):**  And appreciate very much this this update.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:55:57):**  And of course, the story of how you got here, but also the update on on Trailhead Capital.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:02):**  So thank you so much.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:04):**  Thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:11):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end for the show notes and links we

**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:43):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:56:48-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:48):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:52-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:56):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:56:57):**  There are 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:01):**  put money to work in regenerating soils.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:04):**  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:09):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:11):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:14):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:57:16-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:16):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:57:18-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:18):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:57:21-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:21):**  And what questions should you ask?  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:23):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:24):**  What should you read?  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:25):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:26):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:28):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:57:30-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:30):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:57:32):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.

**[0:58:23-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:23):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:26):**  Thank you.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:27):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:58:28-0:58:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:28):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:58:34-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:34):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:36):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:41):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:58:47-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:47):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:58:51-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:51):**  if you're a soy builder.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:58:53):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what

**[0:59:07-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:07):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:08-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:10):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:12):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:16):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:18):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pete-oberle#t=0:59:23):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

## 147 Pietro Galgani on paying the true price for food and agriculture products and how to get there  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:14):**  What would a world look like when you paid a true price for a product?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:17):**  So including all the environmental and the social costs.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:20):**  It's crazy that all these externalities are not part of our accounting and thus pricing  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:24):**  system.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:25):**  We have often talked about true cost accounting and true pricing on the podcast, but never  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:29):**  really unpacked how to get there.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:30):**  There are so many experiments happening at the moment and so much research, and I'm very  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:34):**  happy to unpack them with one of the true pioneers in this space.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:40):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:44):**  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:49):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:54):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:00):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:02):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:06):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:09):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:13):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:18):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:44):**  Welcome to another episode today with Pietro Galgani of the impact Institute, a spinoff  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:49):**  of the true price foundation.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:50):**  Their mission is to empower organizations and individuals to realize the impact economy.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:54):**  A growing number of farmers, producers, shops, wholesalers, cafes, restaurants, and supermarkets  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:00):**  work on true pricing.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:01):**  A true price is the market price plus the social and environmental costs of the product.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:06):**  Welcome Pietro.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:07):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:08):**  And to start with a personal question, what brought you to work, I mean, on an accountancy  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:13):**  level and a calculation level, the cost obviously, but so deep into the food system and indirectly  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:18):**  also on soil?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:19):**  Yeah, I think already from high school, it's more for me the question where you just get  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:28):**  the drive to work toward a sustainable future.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:31):**  And then I think started already back in high school when there was a bit of a global movement  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:37):**  for a rights of people and equitable development.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:41):**  As a student, I was involved in that.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:43):**  And then later in university, I was studying industrial ecology and international development.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:49):**  Wow.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:50):**  And I came really to the awareness that in the end the food system, land is the basis,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:59):**  but also that the current agriculture system is very huge problem.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:03):**  It was also a sort of the awareness rose in that period, like 15 years ago of big problems  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:11):**  of big agri.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:13):**  And there I started to really see that as a key for more sustainable and equitable development.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:21):**  Then I actually did my thesis about composting as a master student.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:26):**  So that's where the love for organic matter started.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:32):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:33):**  And then how did you end up at the Impact Institute or at your price maybe before that?  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:38):**  Because Impact Institute is relatively young and I think you've been there for a bit, but  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:41):**  how did, because you could also have ended up at a compost company or let's say more  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:45):**  the agriculture side of things.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:46):**  Well, yeah, I always like to keep the holistic picture when analyzing this global problem.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:53):**  We got trained in university also about systems thinking and not focusing on a problem too  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:58):**  narrowly to avoid a backfires, that the solution backfires.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:03):**  And then when I saw this organization, True Prize, I was really fascinated by the idea  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:11):**  of putting down social and environmental impacts together in one coherent framework that also  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:17):**  simplifies it and can create so many possibilities.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:23):**  So that's why I joined.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:24):**  And also I was really fascinated by the fact that it really interfaces with business as  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:31):**  well as NGOs and people.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:33):**  It's a really powerful idea of the True Prize.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:36):**  So let's unpack it.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:37):**  If you have to tell your grandmother or your children, very young children, what is a True  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:41):**  Prize?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:42):**  Like in the simplest terms, people that haven't gone deep into the heart of the economic beast,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:48):**  how would you describe that to someone that's interested but doesn't know too much about  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:52):**  it?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:53):**  Oh my God.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:54):**  I don't know if I can explain it to my grandmother.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:56):**  I think when I explained it to my in-laws, mother-in-law in the end, I only understood  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:02):**  it when there was a TV show about it.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:05):**  I hope the average listener is not like my grandmother or my children.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:09):**  Actually we had quite a few people bringing up, we need some kind of true cost or true  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:13):**  prize accounting.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:14):**  We need the real prize of things because too much has not been calculated in that.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:19):**  And I think it's very easy to say that, but then do it obviously is a whole different  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:23):**  realm.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:24):**  So that's what we're going to unpack, but for anybody that hasn't thought about that,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:27):**  what is the simplest explanation of a true prize?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:29):**  We say that the true prize is the price of a product.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:33):**  If you would also include social costs and environmental costs that this product cost  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:39):**  when being produced and used.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:42):**  So a cup of coffee in a bar or something like that, instead of, I mean in Italy costing  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:46):**  one Euro and in the Netherlands maybe four or five would cost four or five plus the environmental  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:52):**  plus the social costs.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:55):**  So when you, to make a cup of coffee, you will have greenhouse gas emissions.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:59):**  You will have land use, water use.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:01):**  You can have air pollution, water pollution, but also you can see how the labour conditions  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:08):**  along the value chain can be suboptimal.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:11):**  That's a very diplomatic way of saying that.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:15):**  Well there is a, you know, people earning below a living income everywhere in the economy.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:20):**  There is labour rights, which are legal.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:23):**  They're not always being met.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:25):**  So all these costs together are costs that are basically present.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:30):**  They're usually paid by someone or they will be paid by future generations.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:36):**  And the idea is to bring them all down to the level of one product, one cup of coffee  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:40):**  and show it as a surplus cost, surplus price.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:46):**  And the insight is also that the science to calculate this impacts at product level has  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:52):**  been growing a lot in the past decades.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:55):**  And now it's the last step is really just to bring it together and see what does it  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:00):**  mean in terms of costs.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:02):**  So you're saying that the data probably is there for many products, probably not all,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:06):**  probably not at the exact level of that type of coffee or that specific brand, et cetera.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:12):**  But we can state with quite considerable certainty, certain things about bananas, certain things  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:17):**  about et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:19):**  And now the challenge is to get it out of those papers and out of those research studies  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:23):**  into a price like next to the product.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:26):**  So you can actually have an idea if the coffee is way too cheap or if the difference is relatively  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:31):**  small.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:33):**  So there is a field of true cost accounting, which is really about how do you measure these  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:38):**  things and it can be for product as much as for a farm or for a region or for a country.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:45):**  And when we say true pricing or true price, it really means, okay, but what does it mean  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:49):**  when a product is in a shop?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:52):**  What are the negative impacts that you can attribute to that product and what's the cost  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:57):**  of that?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:58):**  The price is of course a very recognizable number, maybe the most recognizable number  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:02):**  that everybody uses all the time.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:05):**  And it's a fascinating idea that we're the same ease with which we choose the cheapest  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:12):**  product or we look at prices of product.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:16):**  We could also know what is the sustainability profile or the human rights profile of a product.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:23):**  And I think that's where we need to go as an economy.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:26):**  And how, let's take a product, maybe bananas, but you should correct me if there's an easy  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:32):**  one or one we know more about.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:34):**  Like how much would you say of the environmental cost do we know or are we able to, are we  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:39):**  close to 90 or a hundred percent that we can say with quite certainty, okay, we know that  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:44):**  the costs are somewhere in the range of this and then the same for the social cost because  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:47):**  I'm imagining that might be more difficult or am I wrong there that there's more data  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:52):**  on the environmental side and less on the social side or are they sort of equally developed  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:56):**  over the last decade?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah, it's a difficult question because of course you cannot know the percent that you  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:01):**  are at if you don't know the total, but in terms of like, it also depends on which, how  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:07):**  you look at it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:08):**  What do you want to include?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:09):**  Yeah, in the way that we look at it, we have developed a list of impacts of like 10 social  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:14):**  impacts, 10 environmental impacts that you should measure.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:18):**  We also have a backup list of 10 impacts, societal impacts that right now there's no  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:23):**  data, but you should also take into account.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:26):**  Let's put that aside for a moment.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:28):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:29):**  And this whole framework is online, right?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:31):**  You have it on the website.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:32):**  I will link that below.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:35):**  So on trueprice.org you can find it, the principles for true pricing.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:38):**  And for each of them, we have developed a sort of unit price.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:45):**  So for one unit of CO2, one cubic meter of scarce water and different units for pollution  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:51):**  and for labor indicators.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:55):**  And then the question is, yeah, how do you know for each product how high these indicators  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:59):**  are?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:00):**  And I think there is a methodology for all of them and we've been delving deeper in some  
**[0:10:05-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:05):**  products like banana, coffee, cacao, chocolate, but it can be also very intensive research.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:15):**  Right now you can cover maybe 50% of this list relatively quickly.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:21):**  And then on the social side as well, like there's enough data to put certain prices  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:26):**  on things?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, the data on the social side is being collected by NGOs a lot on a specific theme,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:32):**  in a specific region, in a specific value chain.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:35):**  And we do a lot of piecing together different research done by other organizations.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:39):**  It seems that there's a lot of research, of course, not everywhere, but it's just about,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:43):**  it's never been used in this way.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:45):**  It's never been used to look at the social cost of one t-shirt.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:48):**  And that's our work.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:49):**  A lot of this is converting this research to true prices.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:54):**  But we also work with questionnaires on farm.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:57):**  We worked in banana, coffee, mangoes, lime, all sorts of commodities, especially agricultural  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:08):**  commodities to really collect data on farm level.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:11):**  Because you can start with an estimate, but you want to end up with, especially for the  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:17):**  most important impact of a product, you want to have good measurement that really reflects  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:22):**  that specific production region, that specific production area of farm.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:27):**  And I think the exciting piece, but also there, and maybe it's been happening before, but  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:31):**  what I've seen over the last, let's say a year and a half following you guys, obviously  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:35):**  girls on LinkedIn and other places is that these prices actually have gone out into the  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:40):**  wild.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:41):**  So people, shops, farmers, organizations, actually some supermarkets even have been  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:45):**  starting to use these prices.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:48):**  And so how should I envision that?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:49):**  Like I walk into a cafe, you mentioned a cafe.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:52):**  I think an easy place to start, talk about coffee, chocolate, and those kinds of things.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:56):**  What does it look like?  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:57):**  Is there an extra price on the bill?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:59):**  Like how does it present itself to me as a regular customer that maybe is interested,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:03):**  but not absolutely knowledgeable about this work?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:06):**  Yeah, the most common way is just, you just see, when you pay on the receipt, there is  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:13):**  an entry next to your coffee, which is the environmental cost of your coffee or a social  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:19):**  cost of your coffee.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:21):**  It's being used now by being launched in a cafe in the Netherlands, actually November.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:28):**  And since November, the year before, because we always do these launches on Black Friday,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:33):**  it's in a supermarket in the city center that is selling fruits, vegetables with this concept.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:41):**  And yeah, actually it's a bit up to the retailer, to the shop, whether they want to make it  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:48):**  optional to pay it.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:50):**  They want to make it mandatory or they want to make it just show it.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:55):**  Just transparent.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:57):**  Those are sort of the three levels, right?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:58):**  Like one is transparency, two is if there's an option to pay.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:02):**  And what does it mean for, I mean, I don't know if you know the prices out of here, but  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:06):**  like a kilo of banana.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:07):**  So I'm in this supermarket in the city center of Amsterdam.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:09):**  Does it more than double the price?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:11):**  Does it just adds a bit?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:13):**  What is the experience there?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:14):**  And then of course the question, I mean, they are still in business.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:15):**  They did survive.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:16):**  Like how many people are actually paying the full price, the true price?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:20):**  In the supermarket is called the Anzert.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:23):**  It's just mandatory.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:25):**  Everybody's paying it.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:27):**  So he or she decided to make it like there's, if you enter the supermarket, you pay the  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:30):**  true price.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:31):**  No discussion.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:33):**  We're just starting to scratch the surface now of what it means for the average consumer  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:37):**  to see this and to hear about this.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:41):**  So we said, let's start simple.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:43):**  You have to pay it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:44):**  And if you want, you can learn more about it, but you don't have to make this choice  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:47):**  as a consumer in the shop.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:50):**  And well, they didn't say any sale going down.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:56):**  And I think they had a hundred thousand transactions in the first years using the true price.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:01):**  So of course the idea is also becomes a leverage point to finance a sustainable transition  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:08):**  in the agri-food sector.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:10):**  Because then what happens with the extra money?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:12):**  What's the let's first up, do you know at all how big the difference was with the original,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:19):**  let's say extractive price and the true price?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:23):**  To give an idea, I think usually on a kilo price of fruits and vegetables, it will be  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:29):**  below one Euro.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:30):**  The difference extra.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:32):**  So very little.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:34):**  It's quite little because when you calculate how much it gets produced on a farm and then  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:38):**  you're in the end, it ends up often being very little.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:42):**  And then what happens to, let's say that extra Euro.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:45):**  What happens to the premium?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:47):**  So this will be the next step that we're working on now in our journey is to create the infrastructure  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:55):**  to bring these funds back to make the economy actually better or make the people that go  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:02):**  affected better off.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:04):**  Our first part was really to make this possible to calculate it and to make it visible to  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:09):**  everyone.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:10):**  Right now it's partly invested in carbon offsetting through, we work with a partner or we work  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:18):**  with a foundation that does its reforestation projects.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:25):**  Which one are you working with?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:26):**  Just for the, because you've done some research there for sure.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:30):**  With Land Life Companies called.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:32):**  We interviewed Yuriy and I think he was number two five years ago when we started the podcast.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:36):**  All right.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:37):**  Nice.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:39):**  So we don't have right now the way to bring it back to the farms.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:44):**  We donate part of it to give directly for the areas that work in the same regions where  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:52):**  some of the products are made.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:54):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:56):**  So it's one of these charities that really focuses on bringing just sort of basic income  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:05):**  or just bringing money back to the people and let people decide what's the best way  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:09):**  to invest it.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:10):**  For anybody that didn't hear about GiveDirectly yet, or a lot of the work of the effective  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:14):**  altruism movement, go and look into it.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:16):**  It's fascinating.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:17):**  It will challenge you about philanthropy probably quite a bit.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:20):**  It's basically wiring money into the pockets of the poorest of the poorest in mostly East  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:24):**  Africa, but they're definitely expanded and they are fully free to spend it the way they  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:29):**  want as they are the people that know the best how to get out of poverty.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:33):**  And they've been very, very successful and very rigorous in terms of measurement.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:37):**  So definitely recommended to look into GiveDirectly.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:40):**  I think it's.org, but if you search for it, you'll find it.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:43):**  But now after one year working with a supermarket, we're also working with two farmers that supply  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:49):**  a lot of the fruits and vegetables there and discussing with them, okay, can we spend this  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:54):**  funds?  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:55):**  It becomes a bit like fair trade, almost like it goes into a pot that they can manage.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:58):**  I mean, of course you want to avoid certain things of fair trade, but you want to empower  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:03):**  the people that pay the cost also locally, literally, because they pay the cost of the  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:06):**  chemicals, they pay the cost of air pollution, low wages, et cetera.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:10):**  Somehow you have to get it into their pockets would be ideal.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:13):**  Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned fair trade.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:15):**  We also work with a fair trade flower farm in East Africa with some flower shops in Amsterdam.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:21):**  We also collected extra premium that could be put in the workers fund.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:26):**  But actually we have a vision that goes beyond that.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:30):**  And the vision is that this extra cost, which we call the true price gap, is the gap from  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:35):**  the normal price to the true price should be used for remediation.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:40):**  So when your product is in the shop, it has already been produced, all the impacts it  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:46):**  has created should also be paid off when you buy the product.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:51):**  And we don't necessarily say the consumer should pay this price, but we say it's linked  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:56):**  with the transaction of buying this product.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:59):**  It could also be, of course, that this cost is spread along different steps of the value  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:05):**  chain, whatever the profit lies.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:07):**  Anyway, who benefits should pay the cost?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:10):**  And then the idea is that some types of impacts you can compensate people, some type of impacts  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:18):**  you could reverse them or restore them in the environment.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:22):**  We also calculate some impacts as a sort of, we call it retribution cost, is almost like  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:28):**  a injustice cost, which we estimate looking at fines in different countries.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:35):**  How does that work?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:36):**  What do you mean by fines?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:37):**  So what is the...  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah, legal fines.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:41):**  For example, when we look at labor rights violations, human rights violations, you can  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:47):**  talk about restoration costs, which would be, for example, in the case of child labor,  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:54):**  you could look at the cost for getting children out of child labor, program costs.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:02):**  You could look at compensation costs, like costs to compensate people for the damage  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:09):**  that they have received.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:13):**  And we say, yeah, you should definitely do both of these, but it's also not enough.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:18):**  It's not enough because it's not just, okay, now you're compensated, it's all good.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:22):**  We say, no, there is something more on top of that.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:24):**  And we can continue doing the same.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:27):**  No.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:29):**  So there's a component that is illegal actually to have child labor, right?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:32):**  It's not allowed.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:33):**  It still happens in some places, especially in the Northern part of the world or in more  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:40):**  developed industrialized places where people are able to afford more.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:44):**  They should also be able to afford to check that there is no child labor.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:49):**  So there is a big responsibility there.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:51):**  And then we also look at the costs of child labor fines in different countries to sort  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:57):**  of derive an additional retribution cost.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:02):**  And then we have principles for true pricing.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:04):**  We sort of set out our vision of how you can, on one side, calculate this cost for different  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:11):**  types of impacts.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:13):**  And on the other side, it also provides a blueprint of if this would be a reality in  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:20):**  the shop, how would you use the money?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:23):**  And that's what we're working towards now to really make this market on the other side  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:28):**  as well.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:29):**  And have you seen a big, let's say shift in attention in the last, let's say two years,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:35):**  Corona years or crazy crisis year, food security, empty shelves, et cetera.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:40):**  What has happened?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:41):**  Is there more attention?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:42):**  Is there finally, I see a lot of interest in, let's say the food sector.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:46):**  Have you seen the same through your work in, in true cost accounting and true pricing?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:50):**  I think so.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:51):**  I think there is definitely here in the Netherlands, a lot of talking about it.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:56):**  The word true price made its way into the ministry of agriculture policies or plans  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:04):**  and also into the program of some political parties, quite a few.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:10):**  So that's definitely something that you couldn't say five years ago.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:13):**  I think also in the sustainable agriculture space, regenerative agriculture as well, you  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:19):**  hear it more and more.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:20):**  I think it is a bit, it's very powerful concept because it's a bit intuitive.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:25):**  The fact that there is a price and we're not paying it.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:29):**  Yeah, we're not paying it.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:30):**  And at the same time, it also puts a bit, everyone is able to communicate about this  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:35):**  problem because the price is such a unit and the cost is such a universal concept.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:41):**  And then we can, we can start talking about this problem in a common language.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:47):**  So from the farmer to the retailer, to the consumer, to the policymaker is some kind  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:52):**  of something that is to grasp.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:54):**  With a goal, I'm imagining that at some point the gap becomes smaller.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:59):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:01):**  In a sense that, that this money is used or other money is used and investments are used  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:05):**  and said that the agriculture principles, the agriculture practices, and of course the  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:10):**  social practices on the farms, in the value chain, in the slaughterhouses, in the whole  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:15):**  chain, which is definitely a slavery term, all the way up to your plate is paid properly.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:21):**  And does the gap at some point disappears?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:23):**  Is that the long-term vision?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:25):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:26):**  So the goal is a, yeah, a sustainable and inclusive economy.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:30):**  And this is just an intermediate step to get there.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:34):**  But in the end, so in economic terms, of course you're talking about externalities.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:39):**  So there is some costs which are not paid by the value chain, but they are created.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:45):**  External costs therefore.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:47):**  And this is the idea that they should be internalized.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:51):**  They should become production costs.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:54):**  Every time you pollute, you cannot pollute the water.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:56):**  You have to put more filters, you have to change your technology and that that way you  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:01):**  internalize this costs.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:03):**  And then the product is sustainable.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:05):**  The production becomes sustainable.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:07):**  And these calculations become part of the suppliers, the companies that buy it, the  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:12):**  retailers, et cetera.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:13):**  How about the accessibility?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:15):**  Because I can imagine people already think, yeah, but it means that stuff gets more expensive.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:19):**  I mean, it means that we all share the price for something we anyway end up paying or our  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:23):**  future generations.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:24):**  But what do you say when I don't know, you're in-laws or somebody says, yeah, but that means  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:28):**  things get more expensive in the supermarket.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:30):**  What about people that cannot afford that?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:32):**  So of course it can be actually implemented in different ways.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:36):**  So the way that we do it is we put in the shop as an option.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:40):**  This is our way of doing it.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:41):**  So pay if you can.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:43):**  And then you somehow need to calculate, of course, how many people do that, which has  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:45):**  to compensate for the people that don't.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:47):**  But it's also, that's a potentially fairer way of doing it.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:51):**  You could also on a bigger scale, when you talk about just true pricing, so higher costs  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:57):**  for products that are more polluting, products that have a worse history, how they're made.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:04):**  You can also think about using the money differently.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:07):**  If a government does it, the possibilities are also other possibilities.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:11):**  You can use it to clean up the act, but you can also use it to subsidize more sustainable  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:16):**  alternatives.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:18):**  For example, for the case of food, we did this work for the United National Food System  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:22):**  Summit study about the global true cost of food.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:26):**  And the biggest part is the health costs.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:30):**  So we look at environmental costs and we look at health costs of consumption.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:36):**  And that was bigger than the environmental costs, according to the way that we looked  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:40):**  at it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:41):**  I actually have the numbers here.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:42):**  It's a fascinating research.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:43):**  I will put it in the links below, but just the externalities, I'm using that word again.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:47):**  I'm reading here.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:48):**  So the total global food, it's going to be a lot of zeros, guys, so be ready.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:53):**  The current total global food consumption is about 9 trillion.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:57):**  That's I think 12 zeros.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:59):**  These externalities that occur from this food system are 7 trillion in environmental costs.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:05):**  So the 7, 9 is what we pay all together for our food every year.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:09):**  So it's 7 in environmental costs.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:11):**  It's 11, what you mentioned in human life, that's the health cost.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:14):**  So it's more, so we pay more for the human costs of the food system than actually we  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:18):**  pay for food.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:19):**  And then there's another 1 trillion in economic costs as well.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:21):**  So together, I think the summary is quite interestingly that food should be three times  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:25):**  as expensive.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:26):**  So it's globally on average, obviously taking in huge differences to pay for all the costs  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:31):**  that occur, which is massive.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:33):**  It's like the health part is very, very like out of sync with the rest if you look at it.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:40):**  And this is the, of course, not the food should be three times expensive.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:42):**  This is the current food system.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:44):**  If you would pay true price, but we hope that we can have a more stable food system, which  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:50):**  doesn't triple the price.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:53):**  What was the biggest, do you remember from the report or I would just link it below as  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:57):**  well with that health piece, was there like the 11 trillion, is that the obesity epidemic  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:04):**  or what there must be a big chunk of that in the, are we eating the wrong things, too  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:08):**  much salt, sugar, et cetera, or is it very spread out?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:11):**  Like all the things we get from eating, eating the wrong kind of food.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:15):**  It was mainly cardiovascular diseases.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:17):**  Wow.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:19):**  So then I think that's a massive killer.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:22):**  I'd love to look it up, but yeah, sugar, salt, that would be the fat, that would be the biggest  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:27):**  causes.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:28):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:31):**  And that's of course depends on where you are, et cetera, but a rough estimate, like  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:34):**  we all pay the price now or in the future, which is a multiple of what we currently pay  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:39):**  for our food.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:40):**  And thus either we continue doing that or we start paying the price or we start cleaning  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:43):**  up the food system.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:44):**  That's sort of the two options we have.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:48):**  I think similar studies, like there was one published by the Rockefeller Foundation about  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:53):**  the true cost of food in the United States, which I think...  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:55):**  Based on your research or based on your framework.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:59):**  They used a part of our monetization factors and they found similar things so that external  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:04):**  costs would be way higher than the actual value of the food.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:09):**  But I think, yeah, so you asked how are we going to be able to afford this as consumers  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:14):**  when we are in the shop?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:16):**  And on one side it is, yeah, so you could think about implementing in a way that makes  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:23):**  the healthy choice, a sustainable choice cheaper, and that would already shift the economy after  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:29):**  a bit.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:30):**  You have to bring in those health costs basically somewhere because somewhere we're paying for  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:33):**  those health costs.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:34):**  Like the health system became so incredibly expensive over the last, especially in the  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:38):**  global North, obviously that those costs should come to fixing the food system.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:44):**  That's the component.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:45):**  And the healthcare cost part of it is just the value of health for people, the wellbeing  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:52):**  loss.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:53):**  It's not only about how much it costs to cure.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:56):**  It's better to be healthy than to fix you to become healthy.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:01):**  And another point is that if you would optimize the economy in this way, the gap would be  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:07):**  smaller.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:08):**  I mean, the rising price, we think it's going to be smaller when you actually prevent things  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:13):**  rather than looking at all the damage that you create and cultivating that, which is  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:17):**  what we're doing right now.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:19):**  And the third thing is also that, well, it might become more expensive, but for me personally,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:27):**  it's also just the mirror of the fact where we are, right?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:30):**  The world is full and we need to think about how to deal with that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:36):**  We realize that the environment is going to be under pressure everywhere, but also people  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:41):**  are under pressure everywhere and we have to adapt.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:44):**  We have to go through a transition that we don't know exactly where it goes, but it could  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:48):**  mean less consumption.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:51):**  And so what would you say, let's say there's a stadium, let's say a theater full of investors  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:57):**  listening to this and we're on stage and we're having this conversation live, which at some  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:01):**  point we hope to do.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:03):**  What would you tell them with all this data, all this research, all these pricing, all  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:07):**  these numbers, what would you tell them?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:09):**  Not giving investment advice, but where to start looking to deploy their capital or to  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:16):**  invest?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:17):**  What are interesting places you think that's where, let's say investment capital could  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:22):**  shoot start digging a bit deeper and start doing things.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:24):**  Is that on the health side?  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:25):**  Is that on the measurement side?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:27):**  Is that where would you see a role for investment capital in this transition?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:33):**  I find it difficult.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:35):**  I'm studying a lot of problems that the market has not been able to solve.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:43):**  And then I have to think maybe I'm not qualified to give investment advice, but I think the  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:49):**  natural capital, of course, it's being right now not as valuable as other types of investment.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:58):**  But I think in the future, if you want to invest long-term, that's where the value will  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:04):**  come from.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:05):**  It's much more safe.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:07):**  And also it's interesting the fact that these true price gaps are very small for each product  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:16):**  sometimes.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:17):**  I mean, when we look at the global cost, it comes out very big.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:21):**  It's massive, but on fruit it's a euro.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:23):**  And what does it have a coffee, for instance, do you know, or chocolate?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:26):**  I think also, yeah, you have to think just a matter of cents or a half a euro.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:30):**  Well, they are very destructive.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:32):**  It's not a light product for the earth, let's say chocolate and coffee.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:35):**  And even there, if it's only cents or maybe 50 cents or less in a euro, it shows the potential.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:42):**  But they're huge markets.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:45):**  But we also didn't look at the health costs of coffee in a normal true price calculation  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:50):**  that we do.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:51):**  And part of it, I will talk about it later, but the framework that we developed, we call  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:57):**  it the rights-based approach to true pricing.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:00):**  And part of it of the health cost is also, yeah, to what extent is it a consumer's choice  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:07):**  to buy unhealthy food?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:08):**  To what extent is actually the responsibility of the producer?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:12):**  And of course you can have two or three podcast episodes about this dilemma.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:17):**  Just about that.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:18):**  But right now we focus a lot on with our work also on environmental costs and labor rights,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:25):**  because that's very straightforward actually that we need to do something about it.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:29):**  And it's everyone's responsibility.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:33):**  But the fact that these margins are quite small, when you bring it down to the product  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:37):**  level, I think it has an interesting possibility for when making it possible for consumers  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:45):**  to cover it without having to have the whole intermediary value chain step.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:50):**  So if you go and buy a cup of coffee, it will be possible maybe to know where it comes from  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:58):**  and then to also be able to pay those 10 cents extra to someone who made their coffee beans  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:05):**  and for whom it makes a big difference.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:08):**  With technology, we can probably get that money straight into their pockets.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:13):**  And I also think that really the people really want to make a difference and this really  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:18):**  gives them a tool.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:19):**  Do you see that the consumer is, I mean, the 100,000 transactions in that supermarket since  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:25):**  last year, Black Friday is a proof of that.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:27):**  But do you see that as well?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:29):**  Like the consumer, maybe not the average, but a good chunk of consumers is ready for  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:33):**  this and is eager and hungry for these kinds of tools to give them more to do than only  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:38):**  to buy organic or to buy certain things?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:40):**  Well, if you think about consumers, you question, but if you look at them as people or as people,  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:48):**  oftentimes we don't want to know how something is produced because we enjoy it so much.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:52):**  And then we learned about how it's being produced and it creates some environmental problems.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:57):**  It's social issues.  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:58):**  For sure.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:59):**  And then we say, oh, I don't want to buy anymore or I don't want to forget.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:05):**  But if you would say, well, you can just pay a few cents extra to help in this, to help  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:11):**  the transition to getting rid of this.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:14):**  I think a lot of people don't have these tools now to do something about it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:18):**  And they don't have the research.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:20):**  So I believe that people want to make a positive difference, but right now it's impossible.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:25):**  It seems like everywhere you turn, you're creating climate change.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:29):**  Which is true, probably.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:30):**  You just stop breathing.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:33):**  And so let's unpack that rights-based approach a bit.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:36):**  You mentioned the labour right.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:38):**  I mean, nobody can argue with that or should be able to argue with that, but you're taking  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:42):**  it beyond that as well.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:43):**  What is the rights-based approach?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:45):**  So I think it's not a scientific exercise to measure the true price.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:51):**  It has some normative choices that you have to make.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:55):**  Like what exactly are you going to take into account and what not?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:59):**  And how are you going to put a price on certain things?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:03):**  So neuroscientists can answer that.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:06):**  And maybe economists can answer that.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:09):**  But do you want only economists to answer that?  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:13):**  So we think the idea is that, well, if you have some normative choices to do, what's  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:19):**  the highest normative framework that we have, the reference that we share with all the people  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:24):**  in the world.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:25):**  And that is the human rights, the international law.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:30):**  That when it was done, like less than a hundred years ago, the declaration of human rights,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:34):**  it was really milestone in the history of humanity.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:38):**  And now, of course, we were, Rolow was born after that.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:41):**  And it sounds like, oh, it's always been there.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:44):**  But it's not.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:45):**  It's an intentional statement by all the governments of the world to do certain things like eradicate,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:51):**  give everywhere a decent standard of living, the opportunity to have good health, the freedom  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:57):**  from many types of suffering.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:58):**  And we try to make an economic framework which is within that.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:05):**  So we say, how would we actually use it?  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:10):**  We include only elements.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:14):**  So these impacts that you actually sum on top of the true price, we only include those  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:18):**  that we can clearly link to some United Nation goal, United Nation declaration and other  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:25):**  things.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:26):**  That's why I was saying consumer health, it can be quite a bit of a discussion because  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:30):**  it's the question whether it's an infringement of someone's right or not.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:36):**  And another way that we use human rights framework is this idea of remediation costs.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:45):**  So I think 20, 30 years ago, the human rights discussion or policymaking started to move  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:57):**  towards business as well.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:00):**  So businesses also have responsibility for what happens in their value chains regarding  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:05):**  human rights.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:06):**  They share the responsibility of government.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:09):**  And this is what now is really turning into some law in the European Union.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:14):**  I don't know outside, but they're starting to pass laws that say a company is responsible  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:22):**  for their suppliers, human rights infringement.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:26):**  And the duty of business in this document called the United Nation guiding principles  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:33):**  for business and human rights, which is actually one of the sources of the whole corporate  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:39):**  responsibility movement.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:42):**  The duty of business in this document is to remediate harm made.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:47):**  So we say, okay, let's just take that as a way to calculate the price.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:51):**  What would it cost to remediate?  
**[0:36:56-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:56):**  So yeah, I think the rights based approach to pricing is saying, let's make an economic  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:07):**  system which actually wants to respect the rights of people.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:11):**  So of course you want to prevent infringement first, but whenever we can see, because there's  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:16):**  data showing that there is infringement, then we must be able to remediate it and let's  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:21):**  put that in the price.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:23):**  And we also think that sustainability is a matter of human rights.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:29):**  I think the United Nation is mildly stating this, but it's a bit too separate sides, sustainable  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:36):**  development and human rights.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:39):**  And we say, let's make this link.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:41):**  I mean, we're talking about the rights of future generations and sustainability.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:46):**  It's also a matter of their rights.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:48):**  So we can actually develop a framework which covers both environmental and social implications  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:55):**  of a product, which is based on rights.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:57):**  So what are the next steps?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:58):**  I mean, you mentioned the three steps, first transparency, then it's an option to pay this  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:02):**  price and then it's mandatory.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:04):**  Of course, there are many ways that could happen.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:06):**  Could be that the shop, like we discussed, put that in or the government, or what do  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:10):**  you see now as big milestones?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:12):**  Like what are the next big milestones for you guys basically in this transition?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:16):**  I mean, the Black Friday launch is always interesting, but what are you looking forward  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:19):**  to or what are big ones?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:20):**  Yeah, we want to see transparency.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:23):**  So businesses that are actually succeeding more in the market by being transparent, being  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:29):**  rewarded by consumers.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:31):**  And that's why we also want to see something that reaches the people.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:36):**  Not only it's something for the sustainability report or the sustainability department or  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:42):**  the academics.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:44):**  So we want to see governments starting to, or actually we see also in the Netherlands  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:49):**  a bit, there's value chain actors.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:54):**  So market players are actually companies are actually starting to discuss this with the  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:58):**  government.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:59):**  It's a great sort of a level playing field, which would be interesting for them.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:03):**  Because sometimes to make a value chain more sustainable.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:06):**  So I'm not talking now about regenerative agriculture starting a brand new system, but  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:12):**  also for farmers to convert, it's a big price tag because a lot of the reward on environmental  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:17):**  costs is not yet paying off.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:20):**  But what if it would be?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:22):**  And very different question.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:24):**  If you'd be in charge of quite a large investment fund, let's say a billion dollars or billion  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:28):**  euros in Europe, obviously you're not an investor.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:33):**  Don't give investment advice.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:34):**  And we mentioned before, but what if you tomorrow morning had a new job and you'd be in charge  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:38):**  of this investment fund, what would you focus on?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:40):**  Like let's say the length could be very, very long, but it's definitely an investment fund,  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:44):**  not a grant fund.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:45):**  What would be the main sectors or the main approaches?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:48):**  Would it be a lot of compost facilities?  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:51):**  What would you focus on with your investment fund if you'd be in charge tomorrow morning?  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:55):**  I don't know.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:56):**  I find it very difficult.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:57):**  I've been thinking about this question since I listened to your podcast once the first  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:02):**  time, but I really don't know.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:03):**  I see all these problems that markets cannot solve and I'm more thinking like, you know,  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:08):**  we need different policy.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:10):**  What grant funding could do that?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:12):**  Lobby could do.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:14):**  We need different policy.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:15):**  We need more commons.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:17):**  We need more donations of land, of knowledge.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:22):**  We need different education system.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:25):**  We have a lot of technology already.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:30):**  I think, yeah, if I would say something, I would probably say, I would like to see the  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:35):**  two prices in all the big retail retailers from electronics to t-shirts to food.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:43):**  Is there any sector, I mean, would you start with food or would you start with electronics  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:47):**  or is there, or even within food, is there some sector you would start with like some  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:52):**  sub-sector like, wow, that would be good from what I know now would be amazing to do bananas  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:58):**  everywhere in Europe, or it would be amazing to do meat or something like that or cell  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:04):**  phones, I mean, it could be.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:05):**  Yeah, I would say is also there is different products and there is from two pricing perspective,  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:11):**  different themes that you can get started with.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:13):**  Do you start with soil?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:14):**  Do you start with climate?  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:15):**  Do you start with pesticides?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:17):**  Do you start with living wages?  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:19):**  I would say, yeah, I would probably start with fruit agri and climate because I feel  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:25):**  that the time is really right for it.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:28):**  And then could be that a few years from now, this could be technically possible and a few  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:34):**  years more down the line, it would be normal.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:36):**  Normal, yeah.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:37):**  So we're talking less than 10 years.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:38):**  That's what I hear.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:40):**  And now also thinking about living wages, just covering this gap.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:44):**  So the living wage is also a framework which is quite well developed to say, okay, these  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:47):**  are at least the cost of a decent standard of living.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:53):**  And they're not being met by the economy in this world, in this year.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:59):**  The gap is so small.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:00):**  When you bring it back to our products, the gap is so small.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:03):**  But of course, if you would think 30 cents for a t-shirt, if you talk about cotton farming,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:10):**  then it would be double the price out of the factory.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:15):**  And that also translates through the value chain, through many multipliers to also double  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:19):**  the cost of a t-shirt.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:20):**  So actually just starting with 30 cents extra wage.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:23):**  And I think that is a technological challenge that I think we should be able to solve.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:29):**  And it's an investment that I think would pay itself back because there is a hunger  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:32):**  for buying products by consumers, but you don't have to worry about the social implications.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:39):**  You don't have to worry about environmental implications.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:42):**  So if I would translate your answer of what would you invest in, it would be a portfolio  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:47):**  of companies, maybe starting them or help them get off the ground or investing in larger  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:51):**  ones and transition them with mandatory true pricing where consumers can buy the things  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:57):**  they are normally anyway buying and not have to worry at all about the environmental and  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:00):**  social costs.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:01):**  I think it's also about making the technology available that any company could use to track  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:06):**  the carbon, track the wages, show them to the consumer and allow the consumer then to  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:13):**  pay if they want.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:14):**  And then it could be that the retailer could decide to pay it off themselves without even  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:18):**  offering the consumer this choice.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:21):**  Which is up to the retailer.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:23):**  Which is up to the, I mean, they have their impact goals as well and are hungry for ways  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:27):**  to show things.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:29):**  And so we need to give them that.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:31):**  I think it's a great way to end this conversation.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:34):**  I think there's a lot more to discuss.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:35):**  We'll definitely check in before the next Black Friday because you're constantly launching  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:39):**  things and it feels like the moment has come.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:43):**  It's still very small.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:44):**  I mean, one shop in Amsterdam, a lot of internal discussions, a few cafes, a few places, but  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:48):**  it's so much more than a few years ago when I started following this movement that it's  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:52):**  very, I mean, if this is an exponential growth curve, we should be happy about it because  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:56):**  it seems that, I mean, with the big reports on the food costs or the cost of the food  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:59):**  system, both globally and in the US, we should start waking up about, especially the social  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:06):**  costs and of course the environmental costs.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:08):**  So thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:09):**  I want to say one thing, Kud.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:11):**  I want to say one thing because I looked it up.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:13):**  Most people don't know that the GDP was invented in 1937, that's 100 years ago.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:20):**  And it was became the world standard in 1944, the global gross domestic product.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:25):**  And it was never meant to be the world standard for like the one thing that we all look at  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:30):**  if we're doing okay as a country or not is that, but I don't think that the inventors  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:34):**  never did it that way.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:35):**  But also like it's a young thing.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:37):**  And if we think long-term, we can reimagine the way we do accounting.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:41):**  The international accounting standard for companies.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:44):**  So the way the companies accounts for costs became a global standard in 1973, which means  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:50):**  why in 2030 or 25, there should not be a true cost accounting standard, which is actually  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:57):**  the global standard.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:58):**  That's how you define profit loss, environmental costs, social costs.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:02):**  I think we'll look back at that and think, of course, it's a, so it's very, that's very  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:06):**  interesting.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:07):**  It's very young, but it comes back to your opening point, almost like an holistic approach  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:10):**  here and not an unintended consequences, because I'm pretty sure the GDP inventors or the first  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:16):**  people that wrote about it didn't intend it to be the one and only Holy grail that we  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:20):**  all focus on.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:21):**  And if that goes down, somehow we're all losing.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:23):**  But as you made it very clear, I mean, less is also interesting, especially in the global  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:27):**  North.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:28):**  So it became something much bigger than they could ever imagined and got us off to the  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:32):**  races basically in the wrong way.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:34):**  So it's, we need to be careful also with this because there could be unintended consequences  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:38):**  of the true cost accounting.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:40):**  Actually a final question.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:41):**  That's never the final question.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:42):**  What do you see as potential risks here?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:44):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:45):**  What you said, there's always a blind spot when you put your eyes on something and then  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:49):**  it takes 10 years for it to become a global standard.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:52):**  If you're lucky.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:53):**  And then once the global standard, the world has already changed and then you maybe have  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:57):**  a blind spot or maybe you have a blind spot from the beginning.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:59):**  I think to not have blind spot, the best way to do is to develop this thing with a participative  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:04):**  approach.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:05):**  So not just a group of people in universities or in a research center, but involve civil  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:12):**  society, involve government, involve business and involve grassroots organizations.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:20):**  The people that are actually on the ground.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:23):**  So I think the risk is that it becomes monopolized by a small group of people, the way the new  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:29):**  standards made.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:31):**  And then we're going to be indeed going towards next crisis without realizing for a while.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:37):**  We're going to be in deep trouble.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:39):**  Yeah.

**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:47:48):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:47:52):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was

**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:37):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:41):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting

**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:53):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:56):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:00):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:05):**  different means.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:06):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to

**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:16):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:22):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:24):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:49:29-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:29):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:35):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:39):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:41):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:46):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:50):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:54):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:55):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:57):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:50:00):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:50:03):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:50:05):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

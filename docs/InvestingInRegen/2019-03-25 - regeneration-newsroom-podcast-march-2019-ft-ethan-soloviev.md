**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:10):**  where we, Ethan Soloviev and myself, Kungfansagen, go through the most interesting  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:14):**  regeneration news items of this month. Welcome back. Ethan, for whoever hasn't listened to our  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:19):**  previous podcast, would you like to introduce yourself very briefly and then I will do the  
**[0:00:23-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:23):**  same with me? Sure. I am a farmer in upstate New York in the United States. I'm also the executive  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:31):**  vice president of research at Howgood, where we track sustainability data and analytics for over

**[0:00:41-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:41):**  I'm also an author working primarily in regenerative agriculture. I've written a number  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:48):**  of pieces. I'm starting to work on a book and have a new paper coming out soon. Kungfansagen,  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:00:54):**  introduce yourself. I'm a senior manager at Tonic, which is a global community of  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:00):**  active impact investors. I'm a senior manager here in Europe, where I'm responsible for about  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:04):**  half of our members and our events. I work at an asset manager. I'm a partner in Milan,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:10):**  focused on region ag and food in Italy. I host the podcast series Investing in Regenerative  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:16):**  Agriculture since 2017. We're back this time with the news of the last few months, specifically  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:22):**  of March 2019. When I was looking through the newsletter, the first thing that really  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:27):**  caught my eye was that there are multiple certifications and initiatives coming up which  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:33):**  are really outcome-based. I think one of the main ones that's starting to catch on is Savory's  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:38):**  Land to Market. What did you see there, Ethan? There was an important announcement in the  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:43):**  last couple of months from Applegate, who is launching a new set of products through  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:49):**  a new platform called the New Food Collective that out the gate is starting with the American  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:01:55):**  Grass Fed Association certification, which is one of the highest bars for grass-fed grazing  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:00):**  of animals. They also said in their announcement, this is where we're starting, but we're going  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:06):**  to head towards the Savory Land to Market initiative, which is the first ecological  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:11):**  outcomes verification, the first real chance to show actual regeneration on the ground.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:18):**  I think it's really important to note not only that they're doing it, but that they're  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:22):**  telling the story of their journey. I think that's going to be more and more important  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:27):**  as citizens around the world, as consumers, look towards transparency. They don't just  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:32):**  want to know what certification did you get. They want to know what's the story, what's  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:35):**  the journey that you took to get there. I think it's great that Applegate's leading  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:39):**  in this way. Yeah, and I saw the pictures on the website.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:43):**  The New Food Initiative, they look amazing. I think they quoted something like, for food  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:47):**  porn, you need land porn, et cetera. Beautiful pictures. Definitely check them out. The big  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:51):**  news there probably is that they are moving towards, meaning that it's not so easy to  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:02:56):**  get there. They hopefully are going to keep us posted on the setbacks, but also the challenges  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:02):**  and the victories they encounter as they're moving pieces of their supply chain, because  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:08):**  I don't think they're going to go all in immediately. At least they're announcing something and  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:13):**  a start, which I think is interesting. Actually, it wasn't the only initiative that got some  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:19):**  attention this month, right? Yeah. At Expo West, Natural Products Expo  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:23):**  West at the beginning of this month, a group launched a new standard that is called the  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:30):**  Soil Carbon Initiative. This is the second outcomes-based standard that's going to hit  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:35):**  the market. From now until May 5th, they're in an open comment period, so anyone can read  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:41):**  the standard and submit comments on it. I think it's actually really exciting. It is  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:48):**  purely soil focused. They're not calling themselves regenerative. They're not even saying sustainable.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:53):**  They're just saying, let's build the health and vitality of soils, and let's measure it  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:03:57):**  rigorously, scientifically, and in a way that any farmer can participate. You don't have  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:02):**  to be organic. You don't have to know what agroforestry is. You, as a farmer in anywhere,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:07):**  even mechanized tillage crops, can think about and learn, and they're actually making education  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:12):**  and learning part of the standard, how to improve your soil and get all the benefits  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:17):**  that go along with that. I think this is a very forward thinking, it's outcomes-based.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:21):**  There's different levels of testing that you can do from just simple observations that  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:26):**  could be done low-tech on the ground anywhere to more university laboratory-based specific  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:32):**  technology, to really check soil carbon and aggregate stability, microbial biomass. I  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:39):**  guess I should also say there, if you didn't happen to be at Expo West to see it, they're  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:44):**  doing a free webinar coming up, and the link will be in the newsroom that you can register  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:49):**  and basically see their whole presentation on the standard.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:04:53):**  I think I would invite anybody active in soil carbon to read the standard, to read the proposal,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:00):**  and actively comment on it, because this is really a chance for the sector to get involved  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:04):**  with some of the very big players, because it's Ben and Jerry's owned by Unilever, it's  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:08):**  Danone, obviously. This is a chance to, at least on the soil part, to really participate  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:16):**  in what's hopefully going to be a very strict standard and a very scientific one to counter  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:20):**  a lot of claims that have been made in the past years, etc., around regen or at least  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:25):**  soil building in general.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:27):**  I think that heads you towards something we were chatting about before, about companies  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:33):**  and their role in this movement.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:36):**  I think it's a general feeling I had when I was reading the newsroom or when I see a  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:41):**  lot of the info with the hashtag regeneration or regenerative ag, is that companies seem  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:49):**  to be leading the change and will be driving this, but at the same time, there's an incredible  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:05:54):**  amount of hot air or blah blah blah around it that a lot of companies are claiming to  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:00):**  be regenerative or we're on our way without actually saying anything around it. Maybe  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:05):**  they're somewhat organic, maybe they're not even that, maybe they're somewhat better than  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:09):**  the standard, but I see the emptying almost of the term really through the newsletter  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:15):**  you shared this month. Is that something I only see? Is that my pessimistic view or you  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:20):**  see the same?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:21):**  Both sides of that I totally agree on. A, that companies are leading and that this is  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:26):**  really different from organic. The organic movement was led by farmers, it was led by  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:31):**  concerned citizens and people who eat food really wanting and pushing this forward, but  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:36):**  at least so far in regenerative ag, the companies, the corporations, the larger businesses that  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:42):**  are making the food products, they are the ones that are pushing it forward at least  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:46):**  in the most public way.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:48):**  Why is that?

**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:06:56):**  and that people are concerned about it and that they have a perceived approach and solution  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:01):**  to it or at least part of it, but then I also think that they see the money. I think they  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:06):**  see the financial writing on the wall and we'll talk about that a bit later from some  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:10):**  of my research in the last couple of months on the data, the quantitative side of sales  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:15):**  and regeneration. I think there's money to be made while doing good for the world, which  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:20):**  overall I'm definitely not opposed to, but I am skeptical of a lot of what's being put  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:26):**  out there. There's a new launch this month from somebody who was the COO I think and  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:32):**  one of the founders of Blue Apron who's launching a new quote unquote regenerative chicken farm,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:37):**  but I couldn't tell anything regenerative about it. Their definition of regenerative  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:41):**  I saw the video. There's nothing in it. It's like chickens that are happy, but it's nothing  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:46):**  about soil, nothing about the feed of the chickens, like the basic three questions you  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:50):**  would ask. Yeah, they may be seen better off than a factory farm chicken, obviously, but  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:07:56):**  yeah, they mentioned regenerative without giving any... I saw a few other articles  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:00):**  I think in your newsroom as well that are empty with... There's just the word and maybe  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:06):**  a bit better than the standard conventional plowing, et cetera, but not even soil is mentioned.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:11):**  No, I think there's a couple good articles that lay this out, one from Grist and another  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:17):**  from AgFunder that basically say regenerative agriculture, is this a really great new thing  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:22):**  or just a big marketing ploy? I think it's useful to have that conversation. I think  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:29):**  it's useful for us to be discerning. I don't want regenerative agriculture to get quickly  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:33):**  dumbed down and banalized into something that's just a tiny bit better or not even as good

**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:45):**  happening is really important. Like we mentioned earlier, I think Applegate's doing a great  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:49):**  job at telling the whole story, but then it's also fun to see the back and forth in the  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:08:55):**  New York Times, full page ad in the New York Times where Clif Bar called out one of its

**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:06):**  said, well, your products are mostly made of rice syrup, which is just sugar. It's kind  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:11):**  of funny, maybe it's confusing to consumers, but you know what? I'm actually glad that  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:15):**  people are talking about this and arguing about food and health and soil is much better  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:21):**  than much of the current political dialogue, if you can even call it that. I'm overall  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:27):**  happy.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:28):**  No, absolutely. I think it gets back to the... I mean, it's a discussion we had before  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:34):**  as well. Is it good to call some things organic, even if they're... Maybe we call them only  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:39):**  five percent or 10 percent. Actually, we don't know what 100 percent is, but it's good. You  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:43):**  see these initiatives, the ones we mentioned before, Land to Market, Soil Carbon Initiative,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:47):**  and some others that are actually trying to quantify and actually trying, okay, how we're  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:50):**  going to measure this. Probably we're going to find that it's very, very difficult and  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:54):**  very slow. All the lofty goals were going to be 100 percent regenerative very soon,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:09:59):**  et cetera, are going to be very tricky, but at least hopefully some of these things we  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:04):**  can hold these companies accountable at some point. General Mills announcing a million  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:09):**  acres regenerative, a million we can measure. Also at Expo, we can measure that quite quickly,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:16):**  but we obviously don't know what they mean by regenerative.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:18):**  But that's something we can also at some point start asking the question. It's at least a  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:22):**  goal, I think, and we can argue how far they're going to push it, how many trees are going  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:26):**  to be planted, what kind of agroforestry systems they're going to do or not, and that kind  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:30):**  of thing. But I think that those steps do create a platform of hopefully pushing these  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:36):**  companies further and further down the regenerative.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:38):**  I think so, too. And I think General Mills, they said advancing regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:43):**  on a million acres. And so there are many different things that that could mean.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:48):**  Depends where you start as well.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:50):**  Exactly. And I think they've been good at, at least in their earlier work, one of their  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:55):**  earlier sort of standards from Annies, which is a company owned by General Mills, was a  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:10:59):**  farmer self-assessment, which I really like. It's important for farmers to be able to be  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:05):**  thinking about it and making choices on their own and also choosing, you know, sort of which  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:10):**  stream of regenerative agriculture they want to engage with.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:13):**  Yeah, because I think there's, I mean, honestly, a lot of these things feel a lot regenerative  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:18):**  light between brackets. It's some steps, some cover crops and etc. But to really go down  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:24):**  the line, I mean, you're calling the soil profits lineage in your piece to really push  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:29):**  it further and deeper, etc. That's a journey and that's a huge undertaking, which you're  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:35):**  not doing in a few years with a small rotational change, etc. But it's also the question, do  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:40):**  we want or are these companies, these large companies, because they were saying they're  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:43):**  going to lead the change or they're actually leading at least the public change at the  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:47):**  moment, are they ever going to be able to really go regenerative? Is it Ben and Jerry's  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:51):**  physically, structurally able to do that? And do we want to?  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:11:58):**  No, I think it's, but it's going to be, I mean, we need to keep a very strict eye on  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:02):**  them. I mean, the Blue Apron founders, of course, it's interesting and funny to make  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:06):**  fun of the chickens, but the General Mills announcement, what are they going to measure  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:11):**  and what kind of certification or standards are they going to use, hopefully publicly  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:17):**  to measure their journey? And I hope more will do, like Applegate actually publish their  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:24):**  journey and their difficulties because there are many companies that might keep that in  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:27):**  house, which is a shame.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:29):**  Great. And actually on the consumer piece, because you mentioned one of the main reasons  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:34):**  these companies are moving into the space is that they see a potential or a real consumer  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:39):**  interest in regeneration or in regenerative products. And you published or you presented  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:44):**  something on Expo West right on that piece, on some research you've done.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:49):**  Yeah, this is really interesting. In the last couple of months, my day job at Howgood, we  
**[0:12:55-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:12:55):**  looked at an aggregate sort of ranking or scoring of sustainability attributes and chose  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:03):**  products. We have about a million products in the database and we looked to say which  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:07):**  one is achieving the most of these sustainability attributes. I'm not going to call those products  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:12):**  regenerative. I don't think there are any regenerative food products at scale in the  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:16):**  marketplace right now. But I said, well, these are the ones that are furthest on the pathway

**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:27):**  a million and then track how they are doing in the marketplace versus their category.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:33):**  So how is the most sustainable, the furthest towards regeneration yogurt doing compared  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:38):**  to everything else in yogurt? You'll see that the most regenerative products are doing awesome.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:44):**  They are outpacing their categories by up to 170% over the five-year period that we  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:53):**  were looking at. Different categories, it's different amounts. It's anywhere from 10%  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:13:58):**  ahead of the overall category to 150%. And it's just amazing to see how much that is  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:06):**  driving things and then you can dive down and even in something specific like yogurt,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:10):**  depending on which attributes you are achieving. Are you getting non-GMO? Are you getting organic?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:15):**  Those are good. Those will bump you up a few percentage points in sales compared to the  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:19):**  category. But if you hit the grass-fed dairy going into it, that particular attribute was  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:25):**  predictive of over a 200% growth overall compared to the category. So it's really cool to see  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:33):**  that even in the marketplace, and this is based on syndicated sales data from an outfit  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:38):**  called Nielsen that tracks this. So this is based on grocery stores, not just small local  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:43):**  co-op. This is the big players all across the entire United States over a five-year  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:48):**  period. Products that are more sustainable that are further on the path to regeneration  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:52):**  are selling better in the marketplace. And that is, I think, good news for what everybody  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:14:58):**  here is working on.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:00):**  Yeah, because all of these companies obviously are going to launch or launching products  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:06):**  which have to be, especially if you're large, probably sold at large supermarkets and large  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:13):**  grocery chains.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:14):**  Right. And depending on what category you're in and what category you're designing products  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:17):**  for, you need to know specifically which sustainability attributes are resonating. Sometimes in some  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:24):**  categories it's fair trade. In other categories it's a combination of clean ingredients,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:30):**  preservative-free, and minimal processing. So depending on the category and how the most  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:36):**  regenerative products are doing in that category will help brands figure out what to focus  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:41):**  on and how to drive growth. I'll make sure to link to the How Good page where you can  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:48):**  download just a simple one-page report that shows the performance of the most regenerative  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:53):**  products in all the different categories that we were able to study.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:15:56):**  That would be great. And to finish off this Newsroom podcast, as always, we look at upcoming  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:03):**  events. We mentioned an event in the past, the Expo, but what's upcoming both in Europe  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:10):**  and in the US? First, in March.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:13):**  Just a couple of key events. One coming up really soon, the Living Soils Symposium in  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:17):**  Montreal in Canada, March 28 to 31. I'm speaking on a small panel there. Joel Salatin will  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:24):**  be there, other folks doing holistic management. This was a really big, fun mix of farmers  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:30):**  and activists and businesses when they did it last time two years ago. I'm excited to  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:36):**  present there. It's going to be just at the end of this week by the time you're hearing

**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:45):**  and the City of London, so the financial city of London actually, financing regenerative  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:16:49):**  agriculture on April 8th. It's invite only, so make sure if you want to go try and get

**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:00):**  finance director, Sacha Tripathi, the assistant secretary general of the United Nations Environmental  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:06):**  Program who I interviewed on their project in India. Chuck, the leader and CEO of Soil  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:11):**  Capital will be speaking, who I also interviewed. And Jeremy Grant, the co-founder of GMO, is  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:16):**  invited but not confirmed yet as we are recording this podcast. But already these three plus  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:21):**  Jeremy I think will make it into a very, very interesting mix. So we're looking forward  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:25):**  to hear from whoever is going, what was discussed and what was learned there.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:29):**  And the last event I would point to is one coming up in May, at the end of May in the  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:34):**  Bay Area, which is Transform Climate Communities Capital. And this event, it comes from the  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:42):**  producer of SOCAP, the Social Capital Markets Conference, which has grown in the last 20  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:47):**  years to this massive, super important event for impact investors. And he sold SOCAP and  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:55):**  has gone on to start this new project that is focusing on regeneration, regenerative  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:17:59):**  agriculture, investment, the transformation of land and cities. And as part of that event,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:06):**  it just released a list that I worked on that is a list of all regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:13):**  forestry and agroforestry funds that are out there and operating in the world. And there's  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:17):**  about 40 funds globally that we found for that list and have a little bit of data about  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:22):**  assets under management and size of acres invested in and are going to be expanding  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:27):**  some of those funds will actually be at the conference. So I'm pretty excited for that.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:32):**  I'll be there as well, May 22nd to 24th in California.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:36):**  Sounds amazing. And there are still tickets for that, I imagine.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah, still available going quick.

**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:47):**  investing in regenerative agriculture podcast, I've been recording that next to my paid job.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:52):**  And so I could dedicate about one day a month to it, which means I record about one episode  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:18:56):**  a month. But I'm looking to scale that to actually more because there's so many more  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:19:01):**  stories to tell around regen food and egg and how to put our money to work. So I have  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:19:05):**  a Patreon community live and already some great supporters. And I invite you obviously  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/24/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-march-2019/#t=0:19:09):**  to check that out and see if it's something for you to join. And we'll put a link in the

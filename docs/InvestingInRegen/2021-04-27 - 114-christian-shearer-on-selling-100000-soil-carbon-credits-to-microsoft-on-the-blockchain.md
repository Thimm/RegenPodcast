**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:14):**  How do you sell a hundred thousand soil carbon credits to a giant company like Microsoft?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:19):**  What's the role of remote sensing and blockchains in selling ecosystem services?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:23):**  And why did Regenetwork decide not to build on top of Ethereum?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:33):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:35):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:39):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:44):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:51):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:00:57):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:02):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:06):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:11):**  our work.

**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome to another interview today with Christian Shear, CEO of region network, which aligns  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:37):**  economics with ecology to drive regenerative land management, for instance, through the  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:42):**  region registry, which allows land stewards to sell their ecosystem services directly  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:46):**  to buyers around the world.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:48):**  We had Gregory Landau on the podcast in July 2017, a long time ago, when we already discussed  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:54):**  some of the blockchain solutions they were working on.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:01:56):**  And I'm extremely happy to have Christian for this long, long overdue interview to check  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:01):**  in and to see how much has happened since then.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome Christian.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:04):**  Thanks a lot.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:05):**  Thanks a lot for having me, Koon, I really appreciate it.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:07):**  And to start with a personal question, we always love to ask why soil of all the things  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:11):**  you could be doing with your precious time?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:13):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:14):**  Why soil?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:15):**  Wow, such a beautiful topic.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:17):**  And I think there's actually two levels for me that I want to share around why I'm passionate  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:21):**  about soil.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:23):**  One is ecology and the other one is human society and living a fulfilled life.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:29):**  So first of all, in terms of ecological regeneration, soil is just like the foundation of ecological  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:35):**  regeneration.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:36):**  If we're going to have healthy ecologies, healthy waterways, healthy food, healthy biodiversity,  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:42):**  our soil is the place to start, basically in every ecological type.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:47):**  Starting with the soil will help jumpstart the ecological regeneration we're after.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:51):**  And the second reason is that I personally am really focused on human happiness and human  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:57):**  fulfillment.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:02:58):**  And I've found that when humans engage with the soil, when they grow their own food and  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:04):**  they create relationships with plants and the soil and they get dirt underneath their  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:08):**  fingernails and breathe in that engagement, their lives become richer.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:13):**  And so I really want, I really invite more and more people to create a relationship with  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:18):**  the soil, to learn what good soil is, what bad soil is and how they can be a player in  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:23):**  the production of good soil and healthy ecosystems in general.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:27):**  It sounds like you had quite a profound soil experience, if we can call it like that.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:32):**  Do you remember when you saw that potential and when soil made you happy for the first  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:36):**  time?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:37):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:38):**  I guess when I was 25, I started a ecological education center in Northern Thailand with  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:46):**  a bunch of friends.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:47):**  I kind of brought a bunch of friends together and said, let's ditch the whole idea of having  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:52):**  careers in our lives and let's just buy some land, build some bungalows and just live the  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:57):**  good life.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:03:58):**  And at that time I didn't realize I was going to be diving into permaculture and ecological  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:03):**  agriculture.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:05):**  But the way things went, we started realizing we need to know how to grow our food and grow  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:08):**  the mangoes and the passion fruit and the papayas and we need to learn how to build  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:12):**  our homes.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:13):**  And so we went through this huge learning curve.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:16):**  And during that process, we invited in volunteers and we invited in permaculture design teachers  
**[0:04:23-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:23):**  and just a huge amount of passion and excitement was generated around revitalizing the landscapes.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:32):**  And that's something in me that wasn't there before.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:35):**  Big credit to Jeff Lawton, one of the first permaculture teachers that I had.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:39):**  He's just an incredible storyteller and an incredible...  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:42):**  He brought so much inspiration to me to basically craft my life around the idea of permaculture  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:48):**  design and the fact that I am the designer of my life and what happens around me.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:54):**  And soil has been an important part ever since the start.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:04:57):**  And you could have stayed between brackets and not too downplayed with it and you could  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:01):**  have become a permaculture designer and basically, I mean, there's enough work that for the next  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:06):**  decades and decades and decades.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:08):**  But you didn't.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:09):**  You went into a very technology focused journey.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:14):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:15):**  And how did you end up literally on the blockchain?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:17):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:19):**  Well, it started with permaculture design.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:22):**  So I first learned about permaculture.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:24):**  I became a permaculture design teacher.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:26):**  And then with a number of colleagues, including my co-founder of Regen Network, Gregory Landwey,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:32):**  Ethan Soloveyev, Eric Tonesmeyer, one of the authors of Edible Forest Gardens and Carbon  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:37):**  Farming Solution and Mary Johnson, the five of us started a company called Terrigenesis  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:42):**  International.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:43):**  And at first we were kind of a traditional permaculture design firm that worked on broad  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:47):**  acre permaculture applications, multi-enterprise agricultural systems.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:53):**  But at some point we realized that we're doing a really good job here.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:05:58):**  We are working with literally thousands of acres and making some good impact.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:04):**  But the passion that the five of us have and the knowledge and the desire we have for transformation  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:10):**  in the world, a few thousand acres a year is not even a drop in the bucket in terms  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:15):**  of ecological change.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:17):**  Was there a moment that you realized that?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:18):**  Like was there some realization like we're creating amazing pieces of land and we're  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:23):**  transforming small pieces of paradise because even a few thousand acres is still small.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:28):**  But what triggered that, oh, this is actually like this trajectory is not going to change  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:32):**  enough in 10 or 20 or 50 years even.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:35):**  Was there a moment or was it a growing feeling?  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:38):**  It was a growing experience.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:40):**  First of all, working with individual clients is an interesting learning curve in itself.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:45):**  Where we started was the idea that we could come in as kind of like experts, which we've  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:49):**  never really thought of ourselves as experts, but we may know more than the client that's  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:53):**  hiring us.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:55):**  And that we could then write a master plan for them, which then they could carry out  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:06:58):**  and it would all be solved.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:01):**  And it turns out it never really works that way.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:04):**  If the owner of the land and the manager of the landscape isn't personally invested into  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:10):**  the master plan itself and isn't invested into the design process of themselves, then  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:14):**  it's most likely that that master plan is going to end up on a shelf somewhere and be  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:19):**  looked at occasionally to get inspiration, but they're just going to do their own thing.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:23):**  So in like reevaluating that, like how do we actually do this?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:27):**  How do we actually work with these folks in such a way that grows their capacity to make  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:31):**  their own decisions with what they're passionate about, what they care about?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:35):**  I think it was through that process that we realized like, is this actually the node that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:40):**  we want to be engaging with?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:42):**  And then what other nodes are there out there that we might engage with instead?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:46):**  And with Terrigenesis, we decided, what if we could intervene in existing supply chains  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:52):**  instead?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:53):**  We work with natural products companies, work with companies like General Mills and Nutiva  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:07:58):**  and like these other companies that have a deep desire to be engaging with regenerative  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:03):**  agriculture.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:05):**  And some of the expertise and the background that we're bringing may be helpful to them.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:09):**  And so our company shifted in that direction.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:11):**  Now to make a long story short, after some success in that realm and really like being  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:16):**  the voice of regenerative agriculture in the natural product space for a number of years,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:21):**  we started to recognize that there was some critical infrastructure missing.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:25):**  So the way that I tell the story is a company like Mega Foods, who is one of our clients  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:30):**  that really, really deeply cares about high quality food products and regenerative agriculture  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:36):**  as a source for those products.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:38):**  They were literally investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrading their  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:43):**  farmers and their farmer practices in their system, like a lot of deep care and engagement  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:47):**  there.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:48):**  And they could kind of share that to their customer base, like we're working on growing  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:52):**  soil, we're working on sequestering carbon, we're working on reestablishing biodiversity  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:56):**  in our landscapes.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:08:58):**  And the brand down the road would simply hire a film crew for the day and go to a really  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:05):**  cute farm somewhere and shoot a $5,000 video talking about how much they care about farmers.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:12):**  And from the consumer's perspective, it was really difficult to tell them apart.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:17):**  The regen washing from the...  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:19):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:20):**  Which of these companies can we trust or can we trust either of them?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:23):**  And it was kind of from that seed that we recognized that there is some really important  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:27):**  core infrastructure that's missing.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:29):**  And that's where the idea of Regen Network and an open distributed ledger of what's true  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:35):**  and what's not true about ecological claims came to be.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:39):**  And so, yeah, Regen Network was born in 2017.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:42):**  We mapped it all out on a big whiteboard and it's all gone from there.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:46):**  And how close is it to that big map on the whiteboard you drew in that summer of 2017?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:51):**  Yeah, well, the vision is a decentralized community of actors that participate in many,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:09:58):**  many different ways and bring in their different areas of value into a distributed community  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:03):**  of activity that then is able to interoperate and intercommunicate in such a way that it  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:08):**  uplifts all of them.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:10):**  And so where are we in that process?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:12):**  We are literally one month away from launching our main net of our blockchain.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:18):**  Which might be online as soon as this interview is online.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:20):**  So I will definitely link to that below.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:22):**  So it's a very exciting time, very busy.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:23):**  Thank you for making the time now.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:25):**  Talk us through, especially for, let's say, non blockchain natives, what that means and  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:30):**  how it works.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:32):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:33):**  So the way that I describe our company, Regen Network Development Incorporated, and what's  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:38):**  happening in Regen Network, which is the community effort around all this, is kind of two different  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:43):**  levels of activity.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:45):**  The first level is the protocol level.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:47):**  So at the most base layer here is the ledger itself, the blockchain, and what we call the  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:53):**  software development kit that goes along with that blockchain.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:10:57):**  It is a publicly accessible, open record of all the transactions that have ever happened  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:02):**  on chain.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:03):**  So what carbon credits have been issued?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:06):**  When were they issued?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:07):**  When were they issued?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:08):**  Who owns them?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:09):**  Did they retire those credits or not?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:11):**  That is all publicly available on that blockchain, as well as many and many other types of transactions  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:16):**  that could happen there.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:18):**  On that layer are protocols that relate to data interoperability, which is really important  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:23):**  when we're thinking about the commons and the data commons related to ecology.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:28):**  The interoperability of various different data points is really important so that when  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:32):**  someone in Russia is communicating to someone in the EU and they're communicating with someone  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:37):**  in North America, we all can have a shared lexicon and shared understanding of what it  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:42):**  is that we're actually talking about.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:44):**  That's all encoded into the layer one, into that layer one protocol.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:49):**  Now that is built as public infrastructure.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:52):**  Our company does not own that layer one.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:54):**  It's governed by a distributed network of governors.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:11:57):**  And when our token is public, you and anyone on this podcast could buy that token, stake  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:03):**  the token, and participate in governance on that chain.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:06):**  We would love to have your participation.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:09):**  Now that all sets up the groundwork for the application layer.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:13):**  So on top of the blockchain, many, many different applications can be built.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:18):**  The first one that Regen Network Development Incorporated has built is Regen Registry.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:23):**  Regen Registry is a carbon registry and ecosystem services registry, which brings in an MRV  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:29):**  monitoring, reporting, and verification application.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:32):**  It brings in a credit issuance application so that credits can be issued to farmers and  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:37):**  ranchers after they're verified to have created ecological impact on the landscapes.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:43):**  We should talk about that more, but just to say there's also many, many other applications  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:47):**  that can and will be built.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:48):**  On top of that layer one.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:50):**  Green bond type applications, ecological financing applications, decentralized finance applications  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:57):**  of all sorts.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:12:59):**  Ecological currencies that are backed by ecological assets could be built on top of this chain  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:04):**  and many, many other different applications.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:06):**  And the chain is something you have developed for the commons, something that was already  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:11):**  there and you decided to use or where did it come from?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:16):**  What's the origin of the chain?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:17):**  So the Regen Ledger, our blockchain, is a domain specific blockchain to the domain of  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:24):**  ecological data and ecological agreements or contracts.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:28):**  It is a chain that our company has been developing.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:31):**  We are developing it in coordination with Cosmos.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:34):**  So the Cosmos blockchain, I think right now is in the top 20 of blockchains in the world.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:40):**  They have their whole set of developers and everything that they've been working on developing  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:44):**  functionality for Cosmos.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:46):**  We've been integral in their development and then also we are using and forking their chain  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:51):**  for the development of Regen Ledger.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:53):**  So it's built on the backs of really solid technology to begin with.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:57):**  And how did you choose that?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:13:59):**  Because you say it's in the top 20 now, but maybe it was, there are hundreds of different  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:03):**  blockchains you could have picked to connect with and to build upon or to fork.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:08):**  How do you go about picking?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:10):**  Because it's quite a fundamental decision that it's not something you can easily five  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:13):**  years from now say, actually, it didn't really work.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:16):**  Let's go to X, Y, Z.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:17):**  How do you do DD there?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:19):**  Or how do you do your research?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:20):**  Yeah, there's a great blog post on Medium that we have that goes into depth.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:24):**  So I encourage people to read about this more.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:26):**  How to choose a blockchain?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:27):**  How did we choose ours?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:29):**  In this case, our CTO, Aaron Kralius, who is one of our early members in our company  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:34):**  back in 2017, basically did an analysis of about 20 different blockchains.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:40):**  It was my assumption that we would be building on top of Ethereum because at the time Ethereum  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:45):**  was like the big shot.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:46):**  It's the change rule them all.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:48):**  Everything's going to be built on top of Ethereum.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:50):**  But there's a couple main things that led us away from Ethereum.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:54):**  One is that we wanted to have domain specific governance.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:14:57):**  So the way that Ethereum works, even as they're switching to proof of stake, is that there  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:01):**  is one governance for the entire network and that all sorts of different applications can  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:07):**  be built on top of Ethereum and kind of bog the network down.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:11):**  For example, CryptoKitties, like this completely ridiculous application, caused the prices  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:17):**  of transactions to go through the roof and really slow down the entire network because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:21):**  it got really popular.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:23):**  We want a domain specific blockchain that is focused only on ecological applications  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:28):**  and ecological governance.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:30):**  Now the governance part was an important part.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:32):**  In the Cosmos ecosystem, it's called the Internet of Blockchains.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:36):**  The idea is that rather than having one chain to rule them all, we're going to create really  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:40):**  good interoperability between different chains.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:43):**  And so we're building our domain specific blockchain.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:46):**  It'll be able to communicate really clearly to the Cosmos hub and to Terra and to Akash  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:51):**  and to Iris and these other chains in the Cosmos community.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:54):**  And then there's bridges being built so it can also communicate with Ethereum or with  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:15:58):**  the blockchain, with the Bitcoin chains as necessary.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:02):**  There's more to it than that.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:03):**  I encourage people to check out the blog.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:05):**  Yeah, I will link the Medium post below because I think for whoever wants to go deep on that,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:10):**  it's absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:11):**  And let me mention what two more pieces that the people always bring up.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:15):**  Environmental impact of blockchain.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:16):**  I mean, a lot of people know and have heard that Bitcoin uses the same amount of electricity  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:21):**  as a country like Hungary or Venezuela.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:25):**  It's something like 2% of the world's power is powering Bitcoin, which is just crazy.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:31):**  It's like absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:34):**  First of all, a shift from proof of work, which is what Bitcoin is, to proof of stake,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:39):**  which is what Cosmos is running on, is orders of magnitude less power.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:44):**  And then in addition to that, we're going to be offsetting, obviously, as a company  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:47):**  that runs a carbon registry, we'll be offsetting the impact of all the validators on our chain.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:53):**  And we hope to do the same for Cosmos as well.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:55):**  So both chains can be carbon neutral or even climate positive by the time that they're  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:16:59):**  done.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:00):**  And the second part is the transactions.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:02):**  So transaction fees on Ethereum now are crazy, you know, somewhere between $20 and sometimes  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:08):**  it's $80 for a transaction.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:11):**  And if we're simply trying to have farmers log ecological data transactions on our chain  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:16):**  and they're going to have to pay $20, that's just not going to fly.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:19):**  So having transaction fees on the order of magnitude of more like a penny to five penny  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:25):**  to 10 cents is much more tenable for the whole world ecosystem services.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:30):**  Is essential, basically.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:31):**  And so you've been building that for the last years, four years, actually, almost.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:37):**  And you, I wouldn't say recently got a big breakthrough because you have had many, many,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:41):**  but definitely a big one where suddenly the world or the rest of the world paid a lot  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:45):**  of attention.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:46):**  You sold with partners to Microsoft a very, very interesting deal in terms of carbon credits  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:52):**  and all of that around.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:53):**  Can you walk us through why that is so special and why suddenly everybody paid attention  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:58):**  to that?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:17:59):**  I think I got from three or four different people, the article sent like, look what's  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:01):**  happening there.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:02):**  And it's definitely inspiring.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:04):**  So can you walk us through that, how that happened and what it actually means?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:08):**  So high level, I can't give the exact details of the deal, but high level in the range of  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:14):**  a hundred thousand tons of credits sold to Microsoft in the $10 to $20 range per ton.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:21):**  We partnered with an organization called Impact Ag Partners in Australia.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:25):**  We had Bert on it twice.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:26):**  I will definitely put his interviews in the show notes.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:29):**  Yeah, Bert is great.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:30):**  That whole organization is great.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:31):**  And they're working with some incredible land managers, like through the Wilmot Cattle Company  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:35):**  and other folks.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:37):**  Basically Impact Ag Partners is a grasslands management firm in Australia.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:43):**  They work with individual landowners.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:45):**  We worked with three of their landowners who are practicing, intensively managed grazing  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:51):**  practices on their properties and having incredible outcomes.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:54):**  I haven't actually been there yet, which is I'm going to have to go for sure.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:18:57):**  But the photos and videos of Wilmot in particular are just an incredibly beautiful landscape.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:04):**  It's obvious that the landscape is thriving.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:06):**  And from what we understand, the soil organic carbon on Wilmot has gone from 2% to over  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:12):**  4.5% over the time that they've been practicing intensively managed grazing.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:17):**  We worked with those three different groups and they had already been collecting soil  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:21):**  samples and geo-locating those soil samples in the past.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:25):**  And so we were able to set a baseline of 2017 on those projects and issue credits for the  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:30):**  changes in activity between 2017 and 2020.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:34):**  Our science team developed a remote sensing methodology that minimizes the need for soil  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:40):**  samples on the ground while using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and data to basically take  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:46):**  virtual samples across the entire landscape and have a very nuanced understanding of where  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:51):**  the soil is, where the carbon is, and how that carbon has changed over time in the landscapes.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:19:57):**  So there's a couple really exciting things about this.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:00):**  One is the introduction of this new methodology, which we believe brings higher accuracy and  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:05):**  lower costs to the measurement of soil carbon in grazing systems.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:09):**  We've open sourced that methodology and are inviting others to use it.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah, so a webinar on it, I think of December last year, I think I'll put it in the show  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:16):**  notes as well.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:17):**  Absolutely fascinating how you use and I would love to unpack that a bit because a lot of  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:21):**  people are saying remote sensing and I don't think many people understand what it actually  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:25):**  means.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:26):**  So how do you go from that, from satellite imagery that is public because it's a European  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:30):**  open source satellite to actually selling credits to an organization like Microsoft?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:35):**  Like there's a big gap between that and you had some soil samples.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:38):**  So can you walk us through that process and why it's an order of magnitude better and  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:44):**  cheaper than basically doing soil samples on every different field on different places  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:49):**  and what kind of size, how would you do it normally and why does remote sensing make  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:53):**  so much sense in this case?  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:55):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:20:56):**  So if Wilmot Cattle Company, for example, was to follow the ACCU, which is the Australian  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:03):**  Carpet Credit Units program and methodology, they would be asked to take somewhere between  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:08):**  200 and 300 soil samples across their landscape and their landscape is about 2000 hectares  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:13):**  in size.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:15):**  So one every 10 hectares or so.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:18):**  Every year?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:19):**  They don't have to do it every year, but you have to set a baseline and then whenever you  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:22):**  want to measure the change in carbon, then you have to do it again.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:27):**  So those soil samples can cost anywhere from 200 to $300 a piece.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:32):**  And so we're talking about $40,000 to $60,000 just to set a baseline and then again to determine  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:39):**  whether you've actually sequestered carbon or not.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:41):**  Because you have to do it in obviously a proper way, GPS it, send it to a lab, wait for the  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:47):**  result, etc.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:49):**  And then what you end up with as well is a static understanding, an average across the  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:53):**  entire landscape.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:54):**  So if you're looking at a map that shows the value, the entire landscape would be the same  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:58):**  color.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:21:59):**  It's like we have sequestered exactly however much it is.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:03):**  So that's very expensive.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:04):**  It basically means that only the largest landholders that are well capitalized can participate  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:09):**  and it excludes the vast majority of the world.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:12):**  And a lot of their earnings end up going towards fees rather than ending up as additional capital  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:17):**  in the pockets of these land stewards.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:20):**  So it's always been our aim from the beginning to democratize access to these markets, to  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:25):**  reduce the cost barrier to entry, and to make the verification of these things more accurate.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:31):**  So working with our lead scientist, Dr. Giselle Bumin, who's a remote sensing and ecology  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:36):**  PhD out of Argentina, she developed the Carbon Plus methodology, which is publicly available  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:43):**  on our website for anyone who wants to read into that.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:45):**  The way that it works is rather than taking 200 to 300 soil samples, we take between 20  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:50):**  and 30 soil samples.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:51):**  So that reduces it by an order of magnitude for the cost of the actual sampling.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:22:56):**  We take exact GPS locations of where those samples were taken.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:00):**  And then we use remote sensing satellite data to correlate the data and the figures we found  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:06):**  on the ground with the data that's coming from remote sensing.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:08):**  So if you think about it numerically, there's a numerical figure for soil organic carbon  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:13):**  coming off of each of those spots.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:15):**  And then there's a numerical figure from various different bands of the satellite imagery.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:19):**  And we were hoping to find, you know, maybe a 75% correlation between the remote sensing  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:24):**  and the ground truth data.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:26):**  And we found a 91% correlation between a particular band.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:30):**  That then allowed us to say, okay, now we can extrapolate that correlation across the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:35):**  entire landscape and give a very nuanced, new understanding of where the soil carbon  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:40):**  is and where it isn't, and then create maps that show a change in carbon over time, which  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:45):**  is not only makes our measurements of soil organic carbon more accurate, but also is  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:51):**  an incredibly valuable tool for these farmers because they can see, oh wow, on that paddock,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:23:56):**  when I grazed the cattle in the spring, when the grass was really robust, I had more carbon  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:02):**  sequestration than when I grazed it over in that paddock in the fall.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:06):**  And so how can I as a farmer adjust my strategies maybe to move them around more quickly or  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:11):**  to whatever it might be so that I can increase my soil organic carbon uptake over time?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah, remember an image from the webinar where you basically had the slices, so you had the  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:23):**  different colors and different bandwidth, but over time, so a bit like time machine  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:26):**  in Mac that you could go back, you can go forward and you can basically see that happening.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:31):**  And does that mean you only need to do the soil sampling once or still you would like  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:36):**  to sort of ground it again over time just to make sure that you don't go like with that  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:41):**  9% somewhere in a corner to the different angle and you want to make sure you keep as  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:45):**  close to that 100 obviously, which is impossible, but the 100 as you possibly like, how often  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:50):**  do you need to re-accurate the model?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:53):**  Yeah, so the way that Carbon Plus Grasslands methodology is written right now is that those  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:24:58):**  soil samples are taken again every monitoring period.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:02):**  So when we sign up with a company like Wilmot Cattle Company and Impact Ag, they've signed  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:08):**  a 10-year crediting period.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:10):**  And in that 10-year period, there are six monitoring events.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:13):**  So we don't need to do it every year.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:15):**  That would be kind of a waste of monitoring money.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:17):**  It's fine to just kind of do it every other year.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:19):**  And depends on the time of the year, like do you need to do exactly the same day, the  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:23):**  same hour because we all hear that soil carbon is fluctuating and like you need to sort of  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:29):**  capture it at that exact moment or what's the flexibility there?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:33):**  Sure, it does require the same type at the same time of year.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:36):**  The exact moment doesn't matter, you know, because ecology doesn't work that way anyway.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:41):**  But yes, in grazing systems, we take it in the fall when there is the least ground cover.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:45):**  So we have the most visible access to the soil itself.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:48):**  It gives us the most correlation between the soil organic carbon figures and the remote  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:52):**  sensing data.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah, because the satellite needs to see something because what does the satellite see is not  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:25:57):**  the right word maybe, but measure or like if the ground is completely covered, which  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:02):**  should be in regenerative ag, like it's full of I don't know how many types of grasses  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:06):**  for the cows to eat.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:08):**  How does it then understand the level of carbon or it's that correlation with the carbon probe  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:14):**  basically that you have done?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:15):**  Yeah, and you know, it would be best to have our lead scientists speak to this question.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:19):**  But basically, it's the refractivity that that's measuring off of the ground.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:23):**  There's various different wavelengths of color that are coming back to the satellite.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:27):**  And each of those wavelengths of color are giving a numerical reading.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:31):**  And basically what our science team has done is gone through all of those different readings  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:36):**  and seen if there's correlations to the amount of soil organic carbon on the ground.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:40):**  And they found a combination of a few of them that have given a 91% correlation, which is  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:46):**  like incredible correlation.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:48):**  It's like lab style results, feel very high sense of accuracy around it.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:53):**  And this is only the beginning.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:54):**  Where do you see this going in like five years or something?  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:26:57):**  Like are the satellites getting better, the probes getting cheaper and better?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:01):**  Are there drones involved?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:02):**  Like what do you see, like to get it up more or a lot cheaper, which both would be nice  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:07):**  things to have?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:08):**  Where do you see if we talk in four or five years again, hopefully earlier, but where  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:12):**  do you see this moving?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:13):**  What are you excited about?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:14):**  Yeah, I mean, all of the above.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:16):**  I mean, first of all, the soil sampling and the measurement of soil organic carbon on  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:19):**  site.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:20):**  I imagine that over time, there's going to be a device that is created where you can  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:24):**  actually do the measurement on site, receive a digital reading and have that reading be  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:29):**  able to sign a digital signature onto the chain itself that this device has read this  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:35):**  soil organic carbon reading at this moment and it timestamps it.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:38):**  I don't know where we're at with that hardware, but I imagine it's not that far off.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:42):**  Now remote sensing satellite imagery technology is like on a very, very fast innovation curve  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:49):**  right now.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:50):**  There's all sorts of really exciting stuff coming out from LIDAR to methane emission  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:54):**  satellite imagery.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:56):**  So that is also going to transform things.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:27:59):**  Without a doubt, the measurement of ecological state and change of ecological state in landscapes  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:05):**  just needs to move towards satellite, basically as much as possible, real time satellite data  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:10):**  imagery about what's going on in landscapes.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:13):**  That's super exciting.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:14):**  Now from a programmatic perspective, what's exciting here is that as we choose particular  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:20):**  ecology types and regenerative agricultural management types, we can then aggregate these  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:26):**  groups together.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:28):**  So let's say in New South Wales, Australia, high intensity management of cattle, we may  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:33):**  be able to bring other projects on without actually having to take soil samples on their  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:39):**  exact pieces of ground because we have enough information about that landscape and that  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:44):**  soil, we can extrapolate it out to others, which for me is really exciting because then  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:49):**  that means a family that's only managing five acres of rotational grazing, they maybe could  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:54):**  come on and otherwise it would be inaccessible to them financially.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:28:58):**  And that's where we'd like to see all of this moving over time is that those 500 million  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:03):**  farmers around the planet that are managing one acre or three acres can be incentivized  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:09):**  to be growing biodiversity and sequestering carbon.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:12):**  And so with this specific one, I can imagine it might have been a lot of, I wouldn't say  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:17):**  handwork, but a lot of what then happened.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:19):**  So you have done the soil sampling or that was already done.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:22):**  You looked at the satellite data up to 2017 and the changes until now or last year.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:27):**  And then what concretely happened in terms of issuing these credits and then selling  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:31):**  them for a price range.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:32):**  I mean, we don't need to know the exact price, but what happened then until Microsoft and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:37):**  otherwise bought them?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:39):**  So our science team wrote up that methodology.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:41):**  We followed the monitoring practices as called out in that methodology.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:45):**  And we hired a third party verifier as, or I should say the landowner hired a third party  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:50):**  verifier as called out in the methodology.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:53):**  And so all the steps were followed.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:54):**  A full report was written for each of those projects.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:29:58):**  And those reports are publicly available on our website if anyone wants to go check them  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:02):**  out.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:03):**  At that point, we were talking to buyers.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:05):**  I was having calls with, we have a list of 1400 corporations around the world that have  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:11):**  committed to going towards carbon neutrality or offsetting their ecological impact.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:16):**  And to be honest with you, many of these calls went really well in that the folks were like,  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:21):**  wow, we love what you're doing.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:23):**  Love how you're innovating.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:24):**  This is really important for the space.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:26):**  And you're a young startup tech company that we've never heard of, so we're not going to  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:32):**  buy from you.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:33):**  Call us back when, yeah.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:35):**  Call us back after you've made some sales and had some legitimacy.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:39):**  With Microsoft, they are in a position where they were able to hire their own internal  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:46):**  staff to vet projects.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:47):**  So they put out a request for proposals.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:50):**  They got 189 responses of various different projects that had carbon available for sale  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:30:55):**  and they ended up choosing 15 projects to go with or 15 companies to source their carbon  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:00):**  from.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:01):**  And Regen Network was one of them, which is really amazing.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:05):**  And we've worked with them on walking through the intricacies of our methodology, helping  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:09):**  them to understand how exactly it works.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:11):**  And one of the things that they're really excited about about our methodology is that  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:15):**  it really is in situ measurement of the exact parcel itself.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:20):**  Whereas there are a lot of other methodologies out there that use models to model out, okay,  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:26):**  you're using this farming practice?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:27):**  Okay, so put in that number.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:30):**  This soil type?  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:31):**  Okay, put in that number.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:32):**  You're not actually necessarily having to draw the exact data from that piece of ground.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:36):**  You're just making a model and an inference about what your carbon sequestration potential  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:41):**  is, which they were really inspired and wanted to promote that.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:44):**  And so we were the only soil carbon credit that they purchased.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:49):**  The others were forestry credits and direct air capture credits.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:53):**  Which are very expensive, to say the least, and definitely not in the 10 to 20 range.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:31:58):**  But a very practical question, because I hear some complaints from people saying some of  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:03):**  these models, especially only model until a certain depth.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:06):**  And a lot of the interesting stuff is happening way deeper.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:09):**  And I don't know the details of that.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:11):**  But until what depth are you selling carbon basically?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:14):**  And why that depth and are you planning to do to change that over time?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:19):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:20):**  And it's something that we really need to dive into more.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:22):**  At this point, our methodology only measures the top 15 centimeters of the soil.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:26):**  Which as we all know, especially in grassland systems, there can be a huge amount of depth  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:33):**  of soil organic carbon.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:34):**  So this is just one of the ways in which our methodology is underestimating the total amount  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:40):**  of soil carbon.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:41):**  Which from one perspective is good.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:43):**  If we're going to underestimate or overestimate, we definitely want to underestimate.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:47):**  But then again, to be truly in service to these land stewards that are sequestering  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:51):**  carbon out of the atmosphere and creating positive impact for all of us, it would be  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:55):**  best if we could be even more accurate and measure it to more depth.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:32:59):**  What is needed for that?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:00):**  You need deeper probes or different satellite technology that looks way deeper?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:04):**  Unfortunately, with satellite technology, the correlation is most highly correlated  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:09):**  to the top layers, because that's all that the satellite is seeing.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:12):**  So the satellite really has no way of measuring, and not at this point anyway, of penetrating  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:17):**  and measuring the soil carbon deeper.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:21):**  So if we were to measure deeper, it probably would have to revert back to some of those  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:25):**  other methodologies where you're taking samples at depth and then averaging those samples  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:29):**  across the landscape.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:31):**  Which again, gets into cost barriers.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:34):**  So the way to scale it now is to grow many hectares or many acres.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:40):**  And the depth is until we figure out other remote sensing technology to go deeper, that's  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:45):**  going to be a difficult terrain to go beyond 15 centimeters.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:47):**  Right.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:49):**  At least so far, that's what our methodologies have come up with.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:52):**  Again, we're excited for others to take our methodology and innovate on it.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:56):**  If someone else can figure out a way to go deeper while maintaining the accuracy and  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:33:59):**  the low cost, that would be of service to the world.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:03):**  And there's a lot of talk about ecosystem services, horrible word, but covers it nicely  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:08):**  until now.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:09):**  Biodiversity, water storage, carbon, obviously, and a lot of investors are getting excited.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:13):**  I think you notice that too, without giving investment advice, but like two investors  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:18):**  listening to this podcast, let's imagine there's a theater full of them and they read the books,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:22):**  they read the media posts, they read the stuff.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:25):**  What would be your advice to get their feet dirty and to start in the whole regenerative  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:29):**  ag and food space?  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:30):**  What would be first steps you would recommend them to take or where to learn more and how  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:34):**  to become real active instead of passive consumer of content?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:39):**  Right.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:40):**  So speaking from an impact perspective, my understanding is that what is most holding  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:47):**  back regenerative ag from just going exponential?  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:50):**  And it is going exponential.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:51):**  It just still hasn't hit that hockey stick curve yet.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:54):**  I've seen it in many decks, but yeah, I haven't seen the curve yet.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:57):**  Right.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:34:58):**  Haven't seen it out in the real world yet.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:00):**  It's going, it's going.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:01):**  That's right.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:02):**  Well, financing can help with that.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:03):**  I mean, I would say what is holding back regenerative agriculture the most?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:08):**  And it is the financing and the incentives for the farmers to say, yeah, that would be  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:12):**  a good choice for me to switch towards regenerative ag strategies rather than the conventional  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:16):**  ag strategies.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:17):**  So you're saying financing for farmers or financing in general.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:20):**  That's right.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:21):**  Financing for farmers.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:23):**  Now there's a key piece and Regenet Network has a part to play in this, which is that  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:27):**  the financing for farmers to switch to regenerative ag is going to become a lot easier when those  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:33):**  investors can bank on the fact, literally bank on the fact that those farmers and ranchers  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:39):**  are going to receive payments for ecosystem services down the road.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:44):**  So if you knew for sure that switching your grazing operation from conventional grazing  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:49):**  strategies to regenerative ag strategies was going to produce carbon credits and other  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:35:54):**  ecosystem services credits that could basically guarantee a particular amount of income, now  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:00):**  you can make a case for impact investors getting involved in getting a reasonable return on  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:04):**  investment.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:06):**  And we're starting to see that.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:07):**  I mean, my expectation is that soil carbon methodologies are going to become more and  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:12):**  more of a focus.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:13):**  And we're seeing this with the Biden administration here in the United States with the USDA.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:17):**  We're seeing this with the purchase from Microsoft of our credits.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:21):**  And coupled with that, I very, very strongly suspect that the price of carbon is going  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:26):**  to go up over time.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:28):**  So that return on investment for investing in to management strategies that return ecosystem  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:34):**  services is going to go up over time.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:37):**  And those farmers are itching for that investment.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:40):**  Literally these farmers, they don't want to be spraying chemicals on the land.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:43):**  It's just seems to be the most viable way to get a sure return at this moment.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:50):**  And insurance, crop insurance in many cases.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:52):**  And insured return.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:53):**  That's right.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:54):**  And that price in that range, how did that come about with Microsoft or with other buyers?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:36:59):**  Is it there is no market yet or there's no market price, etc.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:03):**  Yet you're expecting it goes up?  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:04):**  Was it a negotiation with the Microsoft folks?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:07):**  Or how did that happen?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:08):**  And how did you land on something?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:10):**  Yeah, I mean, we had a range of prices for our credits that we set after consulting with  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:15):**  a number of experts and like looking at the markets.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:17):**  And just like you said, the voluntary carbon markets are very opaque.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:22):**  It's very difficult to find out what's being sold at what prices.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:25):**  And they literally range from like a dollar a ton or even a little bit less to $75 a ton.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:32):**  Stripe recently paid $75 a ton for some of their carbon.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:36):**  We found a range of between $10 and $25 a ton, depending on the volume and who was buying  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:43):**  it and what their interest in that was.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:46):**  And then when Microsoft approached us, we talked with them about a volume discount and  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:50):**  worked with them on a price that would work both for the land stewards.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:53):**  We basically brokered the deal between the land stewards and Microsoft and found a price  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:58):**  that everyone felt good about.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:37:59):**  And since that news broke, have you seen a lot of other like from that 1400 companies  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:05):**  that you have on your list that have a climate positive pledge?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:09):**  Have you seen a lot of interest?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:10):**  Like have you been busy brokering other deals?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:13):**  Hopefully I hope at least that like has there been a few of them said, ah, now actually  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:17):**  you're still a startup, but you actually have something to show for now.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:20):**  Let's talk.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:21):**  Have you seen some movement that is encouraging?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:23):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:24):**  So both on the land stewards side and on the buyer's side, we've had a huge uptick of incoming  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:29):**  requests for our services to be able to buy carbon credits for their offsetting purposes,  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:34):**  as well as to be able to work with the farmers and ranchers on producing credits that represent  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:39):**  their impact.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:40):**  And we're excited if anyone out there is listening to this that's interested in certainly get  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:45):**  a hold of us, we'd like to work with you on either sides of that equation.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:49):**  And beyond carbon, there's a lot of talk or not a lot.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:52):**  Let's say there's a niche of talk around biodiversity and water storage and you've named this carbon  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:38:58):**  plus I'm suspecting the plus stands for more than carbon.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:01):**  That's correct.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:02):**  What do you see there in those very nascent markets?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:05):**  Honestly, like what's the interest?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:06):**  Is there interest from buyers?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:08):**  Is there land stewards obviously are interested as well?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:10):**  What do you see in the beyond carbon market?  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah, there's a lot of interest.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:14):**  So first of all, the carbon plus credit is we created fairly simple methodologies to  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:20):**  add on biodiversity, like ecosystem health index, soil health index beyond the carbon  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:26):**  itself and an animal welfare index and just take that onto the credit itself.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:31):**  So Microsoft purchased the carbon plus credit.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:34):**  Of course, they were out to get carbon.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:37):**  They liked that it had additional co-benefits associated with it, but I can't say that they  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:41):**  necessarily like that was a big selling feature for them.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:45):**  But I do expect that having co-benefits associated with carbon in the markets is going to be  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:51):**  a sought out feature and is going to demand a higher price over time.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:56):**  So we're excited about that.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:39:57):**  At Regenetwork, we certainly are not myopically focused on carbon.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:01):**  Carbon is not the problem with the world.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:03):**  The problem is a very holistic set of circumstances and carbon is one of the indicators.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:09):**  So yes, we need to sequester carbon, but perhaps even more importantly, we need to build soil  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:13):**  and we need to build biodiversity and build habitat back into our landscapes.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:17):**  And so we really want to encourage that.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:20):**  Now there already are really robust markets for water.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:25):**  Water is a huge market out there.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:27):**  We haven't yet gone into those markets as a company, but again, we're building a platform  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:31):**  that invites the participation of many, many different applications.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:35):**  So if there are folks out there that have a deeper connection to those markets, let's  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:39):**  work together.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:40):**  Let's figure out how you can build onto our platform and become interoperable with our  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:43):**  systems.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:44):**  The biodiversity markets are really interesting and then the kind of like wetlands mitigation  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:49):**  type of projects where a development project that needs to offset the negative impact they're  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:40:55):**  creating is basically purchasing credits in very similar bioremediation types in other  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:01):**  landscapes is also another market that's pretty robust and growing fast.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:06):**  So all of those are on a roadmap and will come in due time.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:11):**  In due time.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:12):**  And just to shift gears a bit, let's say you are no longer running Regen Network, but you  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:18):**  are an impact investor with a fairly large portfolio, let's say a billion dollars.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:23):**  What would you focus your, and you could of course say, I would invest everything in Regen  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:27):**  Network and buy all the tokens that are coming on the market, et cetera.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:30):**  But if you would have complete freedom, it's an investment fund, which means at some point  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:35):**  the money should come back plus a return, but you have complete freedom on the return  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:39):**  and also on the timeframe.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:41):**  What would you prioritize?  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:42):**  What you focus on if you had not unlimited, but a nice amount of resources, like a billion  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:47):**  dollars?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:48):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:49):**  I wish I could say, oh yeah, I've already got that.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:51):**  I'm already doing it.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:53):**  But we are already thinking about how to structure some sort of funds like this.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:41:58):**  And my interest is in impact investors getting involved, taking some sort of fractionalized  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:06):**  ownership of the various different assets on the site.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:09):**  Have you spoke with the Propagate Venture guys?  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:12):**  We had them at least twice, I think once in an intro and they were a part of a Q&A webinar  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:18):**  a while ago, I think.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:21):**  Ethan and Harry and Jeremy from Propagate Ventures are doing some incredible work around  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:26):**  the ecological financing related to regenerative ag.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:30):**  And so what I would love to see is a tokenization of basically the similar financing models  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:36):**  that they're talking about so that investors can get involved upfront and even own just  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:41):**  a fractionalized piece of that whole system.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:43):**  You could own one tree or a portion of a tree in a regenerative ag project.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:48):**  And make it accessible for normal people and not just 1%.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:52):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:53):**  And so whether you have a billion dollars or you have $10, what we're trying to create  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:42:58):**  is a decentralized finance system that could actually invest into ecological regeneration.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:04):**  And what that would look like is, like I mentioned, some sort of fund that is making investments.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:09):**  Those investments are then having some sort of return that comes back to those token holders  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:13):**  in the end.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:14):**  In the form of, in the case of Propagate Ventures, they're mostly focused on the actual agricultural  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:20):**  output or timber output of their plantings.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:24):**  But we're going to be teaming up with them and also bringing the ecosystem services layer  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:27):**  to that.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:28):**  So additional benefits for all of those investors would be the carbon and the ecosystem services  
**[0:43:34-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:34):**  outcomes that are associated with those projects.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:36):**  And we could literally very rapidly scale up the adoption of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:42):**  if those types of financing mechanisms were scaled.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:45):**  Yeah, we discussed that actually, I think, in the interview with them as well in solar  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:50):**  and especially the lease markets and the finance markets on home solar or company solar just  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:43:56):**  exploded solar around the world because the technology made sense and the application  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:01):**  needed to be financed and it was a very stable or is a very stable return.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:05):**  And that means it's a finance question.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:07):**  It's no longer.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:08):**  And of course, with trees, it's slightly different because there are other risks.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:11):**  But the same, I mean, they need maintenance and they need, it's a similar question, not  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:14):**  exactly the same, but something that finance can enable sort of time travel and get a lot  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:20):**  of long term interesting assets literally in the ground.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:23):**  That's right.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:24):**  So it's something that we need a lot more of.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:26):**  Now if you combine that with what's happening in the decentralized finance space in the  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:30):**  blockchain, you know, what's called DeFi in blockchain, where there's a huge amount of  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:34):**  activity and money being made right now and things moving around, you move away from the  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:38):**  centralized paper based contracts version of all that.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:42):**  You move into a democratized and decentralized ability to have anyone participate, whether  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:48):**  they have a billion dollars or $10.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:51):**  And now you have a system where you can create incentives for investors and give them the  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:44:56):**  liquidity to exit their position at any time while taking in those fiat dollars, transferring  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:02):**  them in tokens, giving the fiat to the landowner so they can actually implement the regeneration  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:07):**  and we're off to some really incredible potential.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:09):**  Yeah, I think it's often that liquidity and because if you invest traditionally in trees,  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:15):**  it's going to take a while before you can have any kind of even partly exit or partly  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:19):**  your money is blocked for unlocked for a long time, which means transaction fees are high,  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:23):**  which means many people won't.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:25):**  It's very simple.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:26):**  They don't even have access to it, let alone if they could, they wouldn't for very good  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:29):**  reasons and making that much more liquid literally would be very, very, very interesting.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:34):**  It's a huge, it's something we need to explore actually more on the podcast to dive deeper  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:39):**  into that.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:40):**  So be conscious of your time and to it's a question I always like to ask, we take away  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:43):**  your fund, I'm very sorry, but you do have a magic wand so you can change one thing in  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:48):**  the ag and food space or generally, but let's say food and ag for the better, only one you  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:53):**  cannot wish for more wishes.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:54):**  It's not Aladin.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:55):**  What would you do?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:45:56):**  Well, I'm going to go back to one of the first things we talked about, which is the fact  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:00):**  that one of the things that deeply drives me is human happiness.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:04):**  I want human beings to be deeply fulfilled.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:07):**  Like oftentimes I look around our world and see the amount of depression and refugees  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:14):**  and war and just like it's so sad for me to see the state where I really think that we  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:19):**  could be so much more creative and be really thriving on this planet so much more.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:24):**  If I could use my magic wand for one thing, I would plant a seed in everyone about how  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:31):**  wonderful it is to engage with ecological systems.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:35):**  Those ecological systems right outside their back door and like start cultivating a little  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:40):**  garden, plant a little apple tree and prune that apple tree into a beautiful little producer  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:45):**  for your family.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:47):**  And that connection to the soil and to the living systems will instigate in those people  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:46:55):**  a desire to have more of that and a recognition that good food is something of real value  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:47:01):**  and that our farmers are as important to us as our doctors and our lawyers in our society  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:47:05):**  and we should be holding them up and appreciating them in the same way.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:47:08):**  So that's what I want for people is to have that in their heart intrinsic connection with  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:47:13):**  natural systems.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:47:14):**  I think it's a perfect way to end this interview.

**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:39):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:41):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:46):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:51):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:56):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:50:58):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:02):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:11):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:12):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:14):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:17):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/christian-shearer#t=0:51:20):**  It's also not investment advice.

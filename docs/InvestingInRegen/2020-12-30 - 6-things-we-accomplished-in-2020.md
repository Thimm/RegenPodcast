**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:00:09):**  health crisis. Many thanks for listening, watching, sharing and participating this year. The attention  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:00:14):**  for food and agriculture has absolutely exploded and our eating habits have completely changed.

**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:01:47):**  regen farms and much much more. We launched the soil builder series. We believe that most change  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:01:53):**  in agriculture will come from entrepreneurial farmers, investors, entrepreneurs, food companies,

**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:03):**  at scale beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money. That's why in soil builders  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:09):**  we're following these people. We're welcoming back previous friends of the podcast to understand  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:15):**  their progress and we're discovering new companies, startups, farmers and investors all engaged in

**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:25):**  series. We'll never forget our first series with co-host and regen farmer Benedikt Beuzel. In this  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:31):**  series we put all of our effort to explore the potential and challenges of transition to understand  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:37):**  what is the role of banks, private investors, crowdfunding. We discovered the power of having  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:42):**  skin in the game profit sharing and much more on the role of farm to fork food companies.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:02:47):**  An enormous thanks to all of the participants. Julian Apers of Triodos Bank, Sally and Esther

**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:03:09):**  co-host and partner in crime. What was our conclusion? Long-term off-take agreements are  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:03:14):**  probably more important than transition finance. They come first. So first we need to make sure  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:03:21):**  farmers get paid well, get paid on time and then we can start talking about bringing on transition  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/six-things-we-accomplished-in-2020#t=0:03:27):**  finance to speed up their transition. You can listen to all the episodes with the link below.

**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:13):**  This interview is about short food supply change.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:16):**  How do we get from a few cute and nice companies selling food directly from the farmer to a  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:21):**  consumer to something which actually changes the food system radically and speeds up the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:26):**  regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:34):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:36):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:40):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:45):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:50):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:56):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:00:58):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:03):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:35):**  Today an interview with Mark Frederikx, entrepreneur on Short Food Webs.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:39):**  How to reconnect the consumer with the farmer and vice versa to change radically the food  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:43):**  system.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:44):**  Welcome Mark.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:45):**  Hello.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:46):**  To start with a personal question I always love to ask.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:48):**  What brings you to the food system, to soil, to regenerative agriculture, to local food  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:55):**  webs and short food webs?  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:56):**  What is your story so far?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:01:57):**  My story so far is that I have a background as a cook and I've been, I have a love for  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:03):**  food for more than 40 years now.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:06):**  I've been cooking from the age of 12 and I learned at a really early age that I should  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:12):**  visit the farmer to have a great fresh food, seasonal food and that seasonal food is something  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:19):**  that your body needs and it's cheap.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:22):**  And in that journey I got a lot of friends within a farmer community here in my region  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:28):**  in the city of Utrecht and I saw all kinds of problems and difficulties that they have  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:33):**  while creating this enormous value in growing our food, growing our crops, taking care of  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:39):**  the countryside and they're not able to make ends meet to get a fair share of money for  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:44):**  all the work that they deliver.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:47):**  And at first I got really angry and after that I got really surprised from how can it  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:53):**  happen that somebody that creates so much value is in a shithole.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:02:58):**  And after that I got creative and I started working in changing this food system and learning  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:03):**  from it, looking at it from all kinds of angles and I have a lot of experience in marketing,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:10):**  communication, internet solutions and gamification.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:14):**  So I used all these skills to build several startups in establishing the reconnection  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:20):**  between consumers and farmers and helping to fix this puzzle from how can we change  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:26):**  the system by reconnecting again and that's in the basics what I've been doing for the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:31):**  last 10 years and I'm at the basis of several startups in short food supply chains where  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:38):**  the connection between farmers and consumers is made.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:41):**  We're building logistics, telling the story of the farmer, doing all kinds of difficult  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:46):**  things by getting the product to the local market and while learning that I think I have  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:51):**  some parts of the puzzle that are necessary for changing the system because it's not only  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:03:56):**  a problem of farmers and consumers, it's a systemic problem and for solving this systemic  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:01):**  problem we need a systemic solution.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:04):**  And my vision is that the ecosystem of entrepreneurs working on changing the food system is at  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:12):**  this moment so powerful but we need a new way of collaborating together to fix this  
**[0:04:18-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:18):**  problem and I'm really confident that we can fix this problem by working as an ecosystem  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:27):**  together and using all these values that are not used at this moment for solving this enormous  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:34):**  problem where ecological problems, economical problems and social problems all come together  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:40):**  in feeding the city and reconnecting consumers, civilians with farmers, keepers of nature.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:48):**  There's so much to unpack there and we're definitely going to talk about the excitement  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:52):**  you have now and we were discussing it before starting recording on the tipping points especially  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:04:58):**  we seem to be close to that in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:01):**  But let's unpack a bit so you founded, co-founded a number of these short supply chain companies  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:08):**  but you didn't stop there, basically you took those lessons and you started looking at okay  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:13):**  what's the next phase?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:14):**  It's great that I'm connecting this group of local farmers with the city of Utrecht,  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:18):**  in the Netherlands in this case and I'm selling directly their products and hopefully paying  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:22):**  a bit more to the farmer and we've seen that in many many many different places.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:26):**  I think we have had a number of discussions on this podcast on that and I know many of  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:30):**  the listeners are either a customer or involved somehow in these local farmer to consumer  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:36):**  startups and it's very difficult, there's a lot of distribution, there's a lot of things  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:40):**  that are very very tricky to do.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:42):**  What do you see as the next step?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:45):**  You say we have such a strong group of entrepreneurs and we seem to be ready for the next phase  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:51):**  almost as the model that you've been working on, the gaming model, I think it would be  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:05:54):**  great to see okay where are we now, where is this going in to five, ten years and how  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:00):**  can we really disrupt the current value chain which doesn't create a lot of value except  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:05):**  for a few people.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:08):**  What I've learned, I started several box schemes on national level, on regional level, I started  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:14):**  local corporations with farmers and what you see in the beginning you're really passionate  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:18):**  as an entrepreneur and I see this process, it's really common in all these regional startups  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:26):**  that want to work on changing the food system, they have to say almost the same journey.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:32):**  They start passionate with a small group of people and they want to change the food system.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:36):**  They get products from local farmers, they sell it to local groups and while doing that  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:41):**  they create their own logistics, sometimes an online platform or a farmers market or  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:48):**  whatever a local restaurant and they start just doing it because they believe they can  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:52):**  change something.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:06:54):**  After a while when they grow they create their own ecosystem of customers and companies that  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:01):**  they work with.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:02):**  I always call them the first line of believers.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:05):**  In the middle you have this group of entrepreneurs or an entrepreneur that really believes that  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:09):**  he can change the system and after two or three years he has a group of companies and  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:17):**  customers that really support him.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:19):**  But in the end if you look at what the impact is of these entrepreneurs, they are not changing  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:25):**  the food system by themselves and if you look at the economics of these initiatives, you  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:31):**  see that they have really costly, challenging to say the least, the logistics costs are  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:36):**  high, the marketing spend is high, they pay a good fair price for the farmer, they don't  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:42):**  want to charge the customer too much because you have to be relevant and in the end if  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:47):**  you look at the business model, you can just roll a step out the road to bankruptcy.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:07:54):**  But all these entrepreneurs, they keep doing what they're doing and they run straight into  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:01):**  the trap of the valley of death and why are they doing it?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:04):**  And I analyzed what really happens.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:08):**  Yes I'm using a product from the current food system, so I have the economics, how that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:13):**  works.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:14):**  I want to change the food system but if you look at all the value that you create by creating  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:20):**  this business, if you look at the data sets, the leadership, the online reach that they  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:27):**  create with their online platforms, their LinkedIn and Facebook networks, it's really  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:32):**  great.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:34):**  If you look at their experiences and how social entrepreneurship works related to food, all  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:41):**  these experiences are the real values of this entrepreneur and from my perspective and on  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:47):**  the group of entrepreneurs that are doing the same thing all over Europe, they're working  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:52):**  together and then you start at the first level with your own company, your own ideal, you  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:08:57):**  grow to the next level, you create this enormous group of stakeholders that is enthusiastic  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:03):**  about you and once you want to make the next step in your growth, you're being set back  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:08):**  because you're in the old system and you cannot change the system by staying in that old system.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:15):**  Then normal at the current market is a game model where just like an online shooter game,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:24):**  I start playing a game, I grow, I grow, I grow and I kill everybody around me so I will  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:29):**  be the big monkey on top of the mountain and that's the system that we're in right now.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:35):**  The system that we as a food chains movement want to adapt is I start doing something,  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:42):**  I'm getting really powerful in my own region and I'm not looking for killing all my competitors,  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:48):**  I want to be more inclusive, I want to grow but I'm in the model of being the big monkey  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:09:55):**  on top of the mountain and if you look at multiplayer online games, our children, I  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:00):**  have two daughters, one of 11 and one of 14 years old, they are being brought up playing  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:05):**  multiplayer online games and I always visualize it as okay, how do these games work?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:13):**  At first, I start my own account, I build my own village and my startup, I grow and  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:20):**  I create a big city that's level two, a regional alliance of stakeholders and then I go to  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:25):**  the next level and I'm not able to really change the food system working by myself and  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:31):**  in the gamification, they have a solution for that, it's called a challenge room or  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:36):**  a dungeon.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:37):**  You have this big monster on level three changing the food system.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:41):**  Because basically what you're saying is at some point, all these different let's say  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:47):**  startups, they get slightly more mature, they maybe are let's say close to break even, they  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:51):**  have a number of investors invested in them, they have a good set of clients like the early  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:10:56):**  adopters, the consumers, they have a good set of farmers but then what's next?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:00):**  How do you really start changing the food system?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:05):**  You need this cooperation model with others like you but obviously there's this almost  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:10):**  animal instinct or there's this natural instinct of competition and you're saying this challenge  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:15):**  room, this learning from multiplayer games that maybe some of the audience are very aware  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:20):**  of because either they play it or their children and some others are not so I definitely urge  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:24):**  you to dive deeper into that.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:25):**  The solution that we know from the gaming world is a challenge room, like something where  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:31):**  you can leave behind your competitor jacket and put your cooperation jacket on and basically  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:37):**  get to work together, if I summarize it well.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:40):**  How it works is after a while you realize that you are not able to come from level two  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:46):**  to level three on your own.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:48):**  Every time you want to challenge this big hairy monster at level three.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:51):**  And what would be a hairy monster, like a concrete one that you run against when you're  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:11:59):**  running your company, your short supply chain company in Utrecht?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:05):**  What is or was a big hairy monster that you felt you couldn't tackle by yourself?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:10):**  At the basics I'm not really changing the food system, I'm just selling a product and  
**[0:12:16-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:16):**  give the farmer a small extra margin and I'm running a really complex small wholesaler  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:25):**  and that is the problem.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:28):**  Small wholesaler in the same sentence is difficult.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:30):**  So that's difficult but I started this company that I want to change the food system.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:36):**  I want to have a fair system where all values are used.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:43):**  How can we pay a farmer not only for creating our food but also paying him for storing the  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:50):**  water in his soil?  
**[0:12:52-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:12:52):**  How can we create a value-driven food system where I feel as a consumer, I feel myself  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:00):**  part of my own local food culture.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:03):**  Now it's all disconnected and you cannot solve that by only being a wholesaler selling some  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:11):**  local products from a current food system and pay the farmer much more.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:18):**  So every time I'm at a level and I think okay now I have a good group of customers and now  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:22):**  I want to jump and grow and really have impact, I don't have enough margin to solve that problem  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:29):**  and it's not a problem that's only mine, it's a problem that we all have.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:34):**  So how do you solve this problem?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:37):**  I've been working on a multiplayer online gamification model where at level two you  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:45):**  have this group of clients and local governments, universities that all work together.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:52):**  How can we collaborate with other regions and solving for instance the logistical challenges  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:58):**  that we have?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:13:59):**  We pay a lot of money for this local distribution.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:02):**  I collect products at a farm, I have my own small warehouse and I deliver it to a customer  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:08):**  and I have one truck driver, maybe two and if I'm lucky I have three.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:16):**  I don't have a big margin to invest in really challenging for instance the logistical problem.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:24):**  So I have to collaborate and in the multiplayer online game they use this challenge room because  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:30):**  this big Harry Monster, you can call it a logistical problem or you can call it how  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:36):**  can we revalue food based on sustainable development goals.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:40):**  For instance how can we store, how can we pay a farmer for storing carbon in his trees  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:46):**  or in his soil?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:48):**  Now I can pay a cent extra per liter gasoline at a shell pump so they can compensate my  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:14:54):**  CO2, my carbon footprint so why don't we pay a farmer for storing carbon in his soil?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:02):**  Very good question.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:03):**  I am not able as a starter because that is one thing that I want to achieve.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:08):**  As a startup I'm not able to challenge this one myself because I don't have the money  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:13):**  to create evidence-based practices.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:15):**  I don't have the political power to really challenge the government and say well okay  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:20):**  this tax system that you have, can we change it based on real value?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:25):**  I don't have the money to build the technical solutions to support this big challenge and  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:33):**  I call this a big Harry Monster.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:34):**  And at the end of the time basically as an entrepreneur you're running around getting  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:39):**  these products in boxes from the farmer in the truck of the one truck driver or two of  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:44):**  your lucky three and getting it to consumers.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:47):**  You're running a logistic company basically and you don't have time.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:51):**  I mean you would love to think about these big hairy problems.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:54):**  You probably think about them but you don't have the space literally to tackle.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:15:58):**  And the funny thing is everybody believes that you're working on changing and challenging  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:02):**  this.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:03):**  But if you're looking at the facts you're just running a really complex small wholesaling  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:07):**  company and it's really frustrating but everybody around you says go on I believe you, you can  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:12):**  do it but you can't.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:15):**  And if you look at how this solution is created by looking at how multiplayer online games  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:21):**  work you have this big hairy monster.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:23):**  I have in Utrecht my own group of partners and my small wholesaler.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:29):**  I have one in Amsterdam, friends of mine have one in Amsterdam, one in Rotterdam.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:33):**  All over Europe you see these regional alliances bottom up pop up.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:39):**  They all have specific solutions, IT platforms that some are more like social inclusive,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:46):**  others are working on really on SCG driven values like carbon or water storage or nutrients  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:53):**  or organic farming etc.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:16:56):**  And if you combine all these resources together you have a really valuable base of knowledge  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:03):**  and capacity to make money.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:06):**  And how it works in for instance here in Utrecht I'm really working together with the University  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:11):**  of Utrecht so I have a specific piece of knowledge how you can create a community of students  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:17):**  around the short food supply chain.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:20):**  And if I see that and I call this knowledge I call it the big hammer in the gaming.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:26):**  There is a big hairy monster at level three, I have my big hammer, I run to the monster  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:31):**  and I'm hitting him on the head and he just looks at me and says well is that all you  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:36):**  can bring to the table and he hits me and I get back to level two again or I go bankrupt.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:41):**  Mostly they go bankrupt, you have one shot of fame and you go down.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:46):**  In the gamification of multiplayer online games to go to level three you have to find  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:53):**  friends to collaborate.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:54):**  So I have to collaborate with Amsterdam or Rotterdam and Utrecht together because this  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:17:59):**  monster needs more than only a hammer.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:03):**  It needs a jar of poison, it needs a hammer and a sharp knife.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:08):**  The jar of poison, you throw the jar of poison, for instance Rotterdam has a jar of poison,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:13):**  throws it in the face of the monster, he gets a bit dizzy.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:16):**  I have the big hammer, I hit him on the head, he goes down and the guy from Amsterdam he  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:20):**  has a really small cricket knife that can cut his veins just behind his helmet.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:27):**  So the monster is dead.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:30):**  We leave the dungeon and go on what we have been doing all by ourselves and creating our  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:35):**  own culture in Utrecht and having our own idea how it works.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:39):**  But we challenge this big thing.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:41):**  I have a student community.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:44):**  In Rotterdam they are working on evidence-based practices based on carbon storage and the  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:49):**  value of that in trees and in soil.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:18:53):**  In Amsterdam they are collaborating with a network of banks and municipalities together.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:01):**  If you combine these, inventory I call it, the hammer is my student community, the sharp  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:08):**  knife is the knowledge of how the value of storing carbon in trees works and the jar  
**[0:19:16-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:16):**  of poison can be my enormous network with governments that help me reestablish the value  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:25):**  underneath what we have been creating.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:27):**  And bringing these together challenges the problem.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:31):**  And if you look at all the inventory that is available right now in the landscape of  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:36):**  all these regional cells of collaboration with their specific inventory, that can be  
**[0:19:42-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:42):**  specific databases, it is the reach that we have with our social networks, some tools,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:50):**  I have a food truck, a food festival, I have all these instruments that I can bring into  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:19:54):**  the table, the authority, the leadership of the individual entrepreneurs within that region,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:00):**  the expertise, specific expertise on SDGs and they also make money.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:04):**  It's not a lot of money but it's more than enough if you combine it.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:10):**  And bringing all these values together in a challenge room construction and combining  
**[0:20:15-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:15):**  these regional alliances together creating eventually a market driven demand for food  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:24):**  based on real SDG goals but also included in a social network, I think if we are really  
**[0:20:34-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:34):**  aware of the value that we have next to the product that we sell, we can face these challenges  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:42):**  and I don't think it's very difficult, all we need is a strategy that works.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:47):**  We can play this game together, we have some game rules and we have all these valuable  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:53):**  elements that are not used right now, we are not using the collective reach of our social  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:20:59):**  network and are not aware of the power that we have if we combine it.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:04):**  I made a small analysis of the ecosystem in the Netherlands of all these short food supply  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:08):**  chain entrepreneurs and I analyzed the combined LinkedIn lists of connections and we saw that  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:16):**  all these regional players have a national level playing field with stakeholders in government,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:23):**  in healthcare, at universities, we know almost all relevant stakeholders but we ourselves  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:31):**  in our region are not able to provide the solutions to collaborate on a national level  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:36):**  with them.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:37):**  And that is in the essence the solution and the strategy that we within Local2Local and  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:44):**  AMT, my company, implemented within the Netherlands.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:49):**  And so basically you're the coordinator because that's of course, I'm imagining everybody  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:21:54):**  in level 2 sees the value, sees the potential but then is also struck by limits of time  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:00):**  as we discussed before, so you need someone or you need a team or you need an entity or  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:05):**  something that organizes this challenge room, calls the players together and also puts the  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:11):**  big hairy goal of this challenge, this specific challenge on the wall and says okay, bring  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:15):**  your tools, bring your inventory because we need to tackle this this year, this quarter  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:19):**  or whatever the challenge is.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:21):**  And that's what you're basically have been doing in the Netherlands.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:24):**  And the trick is combining all these elements and these inventory parts, particles and facing  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:35):**  the challenges, creating a solution together without losing your own regional identity.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:41):**  Because the clash here in Utrecht is a clash on itself.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:47):**  In Rotterdam they have their own cultural challenges, creating the value about what  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:53):**  they think food should be for them.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:56):**  So they create their own culture.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:22:58):**  Culture is a thing that serves you, that takes care of you and it takes care of you because  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:05):**  you have created it, you have fought for it.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:07):**  Wars are being fought for being part of your own region, creating your own culture.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:14):**  The value that we are building right now is regional cultural heritage based on new values.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:25):**  And so you have this process on level two where this clash of egos and all these entrepreneurs  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:31):**  they think okay, I'm doing what I'm doing and it's my challenge.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:36):**  But you have to create a level three collaboration together based on values that are not used  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:44):**  because they just sell products and I think they have this solution.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:47):**  But you have to look at these added values together.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:49):**  And within the Netherlands I had this idea for three years ago, this game solution.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:23:55):**  I'm an entrepreneur, I'm selling products here in Utrecht and helping all kinds of other  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:01):**  short food supply chains as a service provider.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:04):**  We provide software solutions and we help them with their business model as well.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:08):**  So I have two business models.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:11):**  But we created a task force short food supply chain and it's really this military analogy  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:18):**  of a task force.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:19):**  So we're going to do it and it's a force and we're going to use all these elements that  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:25):**  we don't use efficiently right now, efficient right now to face the challenges.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:29):**  So we started this task force with seven leaders in the Netherlands active for 10 years now  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:35):**  in the short food supply chains and we created this ecosystem of collaborating regions and  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:42):**  it's really speeding up momentum.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:45):**  We're able to create solutions like blockchain solutions to really create a value based evidence  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:53):**  underneath carbon storage, water storage in soil.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:24:57):**  So we can make a business model for it for farmers and ask investors and consumers to  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:03):**  invest not only in a product but also in water storage or carbon storage or bee population  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:10):**  or for instance the real value of food because I believe that food if it's really healthy  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:17):**  it's a medicine and you don't get sick if you eat well.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:22):**  You can get better by eating well and adjusting your lifestyle.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:27):**  But at the moment we are obviously not, let's say the goals of the system are not that food  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:33):**  as medicine and you mentioned a few times before like the current pioneers in direct  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:39):**  to consumer market are still selling the same product that the farmer is also selling in  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:44):**  other supply chains.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:45):**  So there's not fundamentally anything different to the product.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:48):**  He or she as a farmer is just paid a bit better and probably it's a bit fresher so maybe it  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:54):**  is a bit better but the future big hairy goal is okay food as medicine great.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:25:59):**  How do we measure, how do we prove, how do we fact check based on that and how do we  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:04):**  supply as a sector that to probably the first consumers which are hospitals, which are places  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:10):**  where people definitely need more food as medicine but you need to attack that almost  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:16):**  as a group.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:17):**  I mean that would be a challenge room but currently there's very few food as medicine  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:21):**  because it's the same apple that is also sold in supermarkets just that you pay a bit more  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:26):**  to the farmer which is great.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:27):**  I mean don't get me wrong it's amazing that you pay more as a short food supply chain  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:31):**  company.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:34):**  But the next step would definitely be that discussion and that fundamental discussion  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:37):**  on okay what are nutrients and what needs to change on the farm to have food as medicine  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:43):**  more.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:44):**  It's a systemic problem if you look at how can we get food the definition of a medicine  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:26:53):**  and there is a protocol for that and all these pharmaceutical companies they have the, they  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:01):**  own the language calling something a medicine.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:06):**  They have the structure and the processes and the procedures are tools of power to them  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:12):**  and the challenge is if we reestablish the connection with society we have this enormous  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:17):**  group of customers with a lot of money, with a lot of voting power, political power and  
**[0:27:24-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:24):**  we also create instruments to really make the evidence-based practice underneath.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:33):**  For instance you can call honey, local honey is a medicine for how we call it hay fever,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:42):**  what's the name of it?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:44):**  Yeah hay fever yeah definitely some certain type of allergies.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:50):**  A doctor is not allowed to prescribe honey against hay fever.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:27:59):**  If he does he gets a fine because in all books, in all facts honey is the best medicine against  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:09):**  hay fever.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:10):**  So it is a super small example but yeah extremely powerful.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:14):**  How do you, okay so how do we make sure as a test regional doctors are allowed and then  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:21):**  let's measure, let's properly get it as a medicine meaning that there's suddenly an  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:27):**  enormous market for local properly made regenerative biodiversity rich honey and not just competing  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:35):**  with the honey in the supermarket.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:37):**  That's very powerful.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:38):**  And if you look at the price, the cost of a pill of reactinia, it's a medicine for against  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:44):**  allergies, it's an enormous market.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:48):**  If we only use the value of that and put it in the pockets of the farmers that has this  
**[0:28:55-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:28:55):**  healthy bee population, we don't have a problem with paying our farmer taking care of a biodiversity.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:04):**  And it's only an example of honey.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:06):**  And you look at all these other values in food that were not used, well we don't have  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:11):**  a problem, we're looking at the wrong solutions.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:15):**  And Mark I want to be very conscious of your time, I want to end with a few questions.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:19):**  This all sounds amazing, very interesting.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:22):**  I think anybody that's active in the short food supply chains really needs to dive deeper  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:27):**  into the gamification model and I will definitely share some of that in the description below.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:33):**  What does this mean for investors, for people that are listening hopefully to the show that  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:38):**  are interested to put money to work?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:42):**  What would you, without giving them investment advice, where would you point them as first  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:49):**  steps and what would you tell them if people come to your door, and I know they do, to  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:29:55):**  say okay how do I become part of this gigantic transition that we all see happening but we  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:02):**  all also have a sort of feeling of I don't really know or see where this is going.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:07):**  The first advice is if you look at startups that are challenging, for instance some parts  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:13):**  of food as a medicine, don't approach them as a product.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:18):**  Approach them as part of an ecosystem with all these other added values that are necessary  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:22):**  to create something.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:24):**  So look at it differently.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:27):**  If you see them challenging for instance the honey case, look at them as okay you're experimenting  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:35):**  on the real value of SEGs, they are not, for the most part they are not good entrepreneurs  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:39):**  but they have a good solution.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:41):**  And the only thing that you have to do is analyze their ecosystem and look at all these  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:45):**  connections within the short food supply chain that are able to really create this A plus  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:51):**  brand but also have a bright range of market share to help them creating this format, look  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:30:59):**  at the business model of that and implement it in this ecosystem of collaborating sales  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:05):**  organizations.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:06):**  And that's a different approach than just okay we have honey, how much can you produce,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:12):**  how large is the market, but challenge by collaboration.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:17):**  I think that is the best advice that I can give them.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:21):**  Don't approach them like a single product, look at their ecosystem.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:27):**  That's the best lesson and I think the momentum now in the market of organization clinging  
**[0:31:35-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:35):**  together creating this momentum, the momentum is now to enhance the leaders in this movement,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:45):**  invest in them but look at the other inventory parts than only the product.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:50):**  And I think if you invest right now the coming three to five years the revenues will come  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:31:59):**  because all is changing right now and you have to be in it to win it.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:06):**  So don't invest in one, invest in more but look at their ecosystem.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:11):**  And if there's one thing, let's say you have a magic wand and there's one thing you can  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:14):**  change overnight with just moving that wand and say okay tomorrow morning we'll wake up  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:19):**  and Mark changed something in the food and agriculture system and if it could be anything  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:24):**  what would that be?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:27):**  My challenge is and I started with that I have this ecosystem of students collaborating  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:34):**  with our farmers.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:36):**  What I am changing is I reestablished the connection between universities and schools  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:41):**  of applied science with the primary farmer.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:45):**  So I create a future perspective for the farmers with the young and talented people with all  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:49):**  this new knowledge and that is my thing.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:53):**  What is my, it's a product, that is what I'm doing.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:57):**  I reestablished.  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:58):**  The theory of change.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:32:59):**  Yeah because it's not within the food system itself that the solution is.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:03):**  It is within the cross-sectoral connections between healthcare and farming, education  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:10):**  and farming, logistic and farming.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:13):**  It's on the crossroads of these sectors where the value is made.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:19):**  Food is a medicine, education is part of an ecosystem for creating culture.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:26):**  It's not an institution, it's part of a local ecosystem and that is what we, what I'm doing  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:32):**  especially.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:33):**  And what gets you excited.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:35):**  I want to thank you so much for your time Mark and for trying to squeeze 10 years of  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:41):**  knowledge and learning and doing into 33 minutes which is not easy at all.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:46):**  I don't think it's the last time we talk, I have to check in and see how local to local  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:50):**  is going, how this coalition of pioneers in the Netherlands and in Europe, because  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:55):**  you're connected to most of the pioneers in this field in Europe.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:33:59):**  And I think with the current momentum, the current tipping points we're getting closer  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:04):**  to from farmers that are protesting in the street in Europe to a new Green Deal which  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:09):**  is coming and the focus on agri-food as part of, has to be part of the solution and not  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:14):**  just part of the problem.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:17):**  It's going to be a very exciting next few years.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:20):**  Yeah well, join the ride.

**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:34:24):**  Yes, fine, thank you as well.

**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:35:28):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question

**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:36:39):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware

**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:36:58):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:05):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:07):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:12):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:17):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:22):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:23):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:28):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:32):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:37):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:38):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:40):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:42):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:46):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/25/mark-frederiks/#t=0:37:48):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

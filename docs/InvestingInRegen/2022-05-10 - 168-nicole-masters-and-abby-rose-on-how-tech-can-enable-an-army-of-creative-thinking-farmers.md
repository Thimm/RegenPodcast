**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:14):**  Did you know most farmers never dug a hole to look at their soil or smell their soil?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:19):**  How can we change that and create a quote unquote army of farmers who are super curious  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:24):**  and how do we empower them to keep asking themselves why, why, why?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:29):**  What role can tech play here and how can it lead to the much needed mindset shift to a  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:34):**  more regenerative one, seeing the potential of abundance not be hindered by competitive  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:38):**  thinking?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:39):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:45):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:50):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:00:55):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:00):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:02):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:06):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:11):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:15):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:54):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:01:57):**  And we have had Abby, don't worry if we're talking at the same time, we're recording  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:01):**  a different track so nothing happens.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:03):**  We have had Abby before on the show but for anybody that didn't listen to that episode,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:07):**  of course I will link it below.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:08):**  You joined us for a very interesting webinar on the role of technology in regeneration  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:12):**  as well, which was two years ago and we had you in 2019, so three years ago on the show.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:17):**  A lot has happened.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:19):**  If you have to briefly or slightly, not so briefly, introduce yourself, what do you normally  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:25):**  say when you meet somebody in the subway or somewhere in an elevator and you have a long  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:31):**  elevator ride, let's say five minutes, what do you say?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:34):**  How do you introduce yourself?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:35):**  And then we get into what are you busy with here at the end or beginning of spring in  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:41):**  2022?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:42):**  Yeah, well, I guess I always start with the fact that my family started farming when I  
**[0:02:50-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:02:50):**  was in my late teens and through visiting the farm, I became totally obsessed with farming  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:00):**  basically because before that I actually wasn't interested at all and I thought it was sort  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:06):**  of boring and nothing to do with me and now it's my life and why did I become so interested?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:14):**  It was because I realized that every decision we make on the farm not only affects us, but  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:20):**  it affects everyone around us and really it affects everyone on the globe because we're  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:26):**  making decisions about how do we graze our animals and therefore how much carbon is sequestered  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:31):**  in the soil?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:34):**  How much rain are we capturing?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:35):**  So all of these things made me really realize that actually farming and farmers are one  
**[0:03:40-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:40):**  of the main interaction points of humanity with the natural world and so yeah, I became  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:48):**  very involved and through that, my family's farm is in Chile and so we were kind of trying  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:56):**  to farm organically.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:03:58):**  We had olives, almonds, pistachios, now we have that and some vines and there were just  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:07):**  so many questions all the time.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:08):**  It's like, oh no, now what do we do?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:10):**  There's a new problem and who do you ask?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:14):**  And so out of that, two things came about which are the main things I spend my life  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:18):**  on today.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:20):**  One of them is Farmerama, which is a podcast showing the voices of the regenerative farming  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:25):**  movement and that really was about going out and being able to ask people, what are you  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:30):**  doing about this on the ground?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:34):**  Who are the pioneers here?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:35):**  And we definitely had Nicole on there a few times giving us insights into how to buy our  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:41):**  prime seeds and very practical things as well as storytelling.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:47):**  And then also at the time, we didn't have any way to monitor the crops or trees and  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:53):**  so I had studied physics and I was able to code so I built some tools for using on our  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:04:59):**  farm an app and then that kind of our neighbors started using it and that was developed into  
**[0:05:04-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:04):**  our company, VitaCycleTech, which is we offer a soil mentor, sector mentor and work mentor  
**[0:05:12-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:12):**  and those are all apps focused on helping farmers in the regenerative transition, particularly  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:22):**  the sector mentor is focused on vineyards and orchards or agroforestry and then soil  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:29):**  mentor is very focused on soil health and biodiversity, so more general farming and  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:36):**  work mentor is on farm worker management for small to medium scale farms.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:40):**  And so we use all three of those on our farm in Chile and then it's a super privilege to  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:47):**  work with farmers around the world and amazing, well, partner with Nicole to really bring  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:05:55):**  some of those insights about what does it look like to build good soil health and how  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:02):**  can you keep your vines healthy using the least inputs possible.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:08):**  The soil first approach is really embedded in everything we do.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:12):**  Super and yeah, we're going to unpack more of that obviously, but first let's welcome  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:16):**  Nicole for the first time here on the show and definitely feels like we have a very famous  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:22):**  person among ourselves.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:24):**  And what brought you, because I don't know the origin of your soil story, let's say the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:28):**  origin of your story, what brought you to agriculture and food and go so deep literally  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:34):**  and figuratively into the world of soil?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:37):**  Well thank you for asking that question, Kern, and I believe everybody has these originating  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:42):**  stories and sometimes I wonder if it's just been in my DNA forever.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:48):**  If you ask my parents, they'll talk about stories of, you know, they can't find me and  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:52):**  I'll be in the garden eating slugs and snails and you know, I've always had that obsession  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:57):**  with soil under my fingers.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:06:59):**  But I think as well as a New Zealander, we're very connected to the rural community more  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:04):**  than many other societies.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:07):**  You know, all my different relatives were certainly farming.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:10):**  I was brought up as a military brat, so Air Force, you know, traveling a lot, spending  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:15):**  a lot of time in aircraft looking down and just being incredibly concerned.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:19):**  I mean, some of my earliest memories is seeing the scale of erosion in New Zealand and being  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:24):**  really concerned as a little person, like, where's that going and what's it doing to  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:28):**  the rivers?  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:31):**  And then Mount St. Helens erupted when I was five and my Nana subscribed me to National  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:36):**  Geographic and just being like, wow, we are so small in all of this and how quickly nature  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:42):**  can just overwhelm everything.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:45):**  And then National Geographic tracked that recovery of those landscapes and it's like,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:49):**  you know, nature is so resilient.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:52):**  And yeah, it's just, it has been a journey that's just kept evolving and evolving like  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:07:57):**  I never had in my mind, I'm going to be an agroecologist when I grow up.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:02):**  And in fact, I was an agroecologist for eight years before I realized it had a name.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:06):**  Like I just was working in this field, working with farmers and ranchers and connecting them  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:11):**  to soil and thinking about ecological context because that's my background and then go,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:16):**  oh wow, this is actually a thing.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:19):**  But one of my, like you have these pivotal moments and one of them happened in Hong Kong.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:23):**  So we lived in Hong Kong for seven years, or I did, my family was there for like 14.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:29):**  And I remember just looking at all of the soot and the poor air quality and the plastic  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:36):**  bags that were just everywhere and thinking, we will live in our own filth if we don't  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:42):**  interrupt the pattern.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:44):**  What does it take to interrupt a behavioral pattern so that this doesn't become normalized?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:48):**  So it's become very formative for me in terms of, I do feel like I can be a bit of a disruptor  
**[0:08:53-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:08:53):**  or a paradigm shifter and how do we shift forward because it's not going to take complacency  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:01):**  in business as usual.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:02):**  So yeah, there's so many stories I could share, like everybody.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:07):**  And what do you spend, I mean, except for being on a podcast, but let's say your days  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:14):**  on or your work on, what is keeping you busy now in April 2022?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:20):**  What are you spending most of your time on?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:22):**  And we'll unpack obviously the Regia platform and you working with VitaCycle, but beyond  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:27):**  that or next to that, what is keeping you busy?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:29):**  So our core work since 2003 has been education.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:33):**  And actually even before that, 2003, I formalized having a company.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:40):**  So education is definitely the backbone of what we do.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:44):**  And what we're doing right now is we're coaching the coaches.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:46):**  So people that are interested in agroecology and coaching or consulting, we have a five  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:51):**  month long program and that just finished yesterday.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:54):**  So I'm still kind of spinning from the impact that that program's had on my life and the  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:09:58):**  impact that I see it having on people.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:01):**  Like we spent all yesterday just crying and crying with joy of like, what is now possible  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:08):**  for people in the world?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:10):**  And it was one of the women who's incredibly talented and pretty well known, so I won't  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:15):**  necessarily mention her name, but she was saying, I thought I'd come to this course  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:19):**  and learn more about you.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:21):**  And what you do and the work that you do.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:23):**  And she's like, what I came to the course and learned about was myself.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:27):**  And if we're not transforming this piece, which is that internal space and our mindset  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:33):**  and our paradigms, then real change isn't going to happen on the ground.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:37):**  And so that was the driver behind the program is yeah, we're going to look at the technical  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:42):**  aspects of how does this microbe in the soil affect the uptake of this nutrient to the  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:48):**  plant?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:49):**  And in human health, but we really delve into the technical side, but woven through all  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:55):**  of that is who are we being in this space?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:10:59):**  So I've been absolutely blown away by the success of that program.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:04):**  And I feel very heartened today and tired.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:09):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:10):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:11):**  And will you be repeating that program?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:13):**  It sounds like it was a first time or a first one, like the impact it had.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:18):**  Because that naturally raises the question, is it going to come back or is it done?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:24):**  Because I haven't dealt with my world of overwhelm.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:28):**  We're running it again in another couple of months.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:30):**  So the next intake shuts on the 15th of May.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:35):**  And we will do one more in the US.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:37):**  And then next year, we're looking to Australia.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:41):**  And then probably in 2024, we'll be looking at Europe.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:45):**  It's a big undertaking.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:48):**  Every person on that program gets an individual coach that they're working through processes.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:52):**  It's not something that we can just throw out in the world and say, hey, you do this  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:58):**  and walk away from it.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:11:59):**  It is incredibly intensive.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:01):**  And then you find time next to that.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:03):**  And I want to bring in Abby as well on when did this region platform started to, let's  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:11):**  say, started to fermentate and started to seed or sprout?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:14):**  What was the because you've been building these apps and tech side and that felt like  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:21):**  maybe it wasn't enough?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:22):**  Like, you could have grown that for a long time, I think.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:26):**  And then you said, let's bring on another layer.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:28):**  Let's add another layer to that.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:30):**  Why did you decide to do that?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:31):**  And then why did you decide or how did you ended up partnering with Nicole?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:35):**  That doesn't seem like she has nothing to do.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:37):**  So it was like, how do you build that?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:42):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I read Nicole's book called For the Love of Soil.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:48):**  And I would highly recommend it to be read by anyone who's interested in this at all.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:53):**  Because it's, well, one, it's extremely entertaining.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:12:56):**  But two, it is an amazing balance of like the personal and the technical.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:03):**  And so I think that, you know, whether even if you know nothing about regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:07):**  you can really enjoy it and you can learn a heck of a lot.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:10):**  So reading that, also, Nicole has a strong emphasis on digging holes.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:17):**  And that's something that I have learned.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:21):**  That's the way I've learned about soil.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:23):**  You know, I dug my first hole, like in 2017.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:26):**  That's embarrassingly recently.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:30):**  But that was the beginning of my journey.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:31):**  Depends on when somebody listens to this.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:32):**  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:33):**  But yeah, that was the beginning of my journey into learning like what soil really is.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:41):**  It's one of those things that I'd heard everyone talk about it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:44):**  You know, I've been involved in this world for quite a few years before that.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:47):**  But I'd always been like, oh, yeah, soil is really important.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:50):**  But that was where my knowledge ended.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:53):**  And then I started to dig some holes.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:54):**  And I read Nicole's book and started to piece together all this information about this world  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:13:59):**  below our feet and how much you can learn from looking at it.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:03):**  And so that was why when Nicole like really built on that knowledge of how much you can  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:08):**  learn from looking at it and some of the things, you know, distinctions that she drew out in  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:13):**  her book.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:14):**  So I was like, oh, my gosh, I've got to talk to this person.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:16):**  This is incredible.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:19):**  And so, yeah, I can't remember who introduced us, but we had an initial chat.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:24):**  I think, oh, yeah, maybe.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:28):**  And I think what really got us connected, I guess, at the time was that actually I brought  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:35):**  up the feminist business principles, which I've definitely talked about before.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:41):**  And we talked through them.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:43):**  And Nicole, you really encouraged me to move.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:46):**  You know, how can we not have them be about gender, but actually have them be about something  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:51):**  everyone can see themselves stepping into.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:14:54):**  And yeah, so that's we've moved into the regenerative business principles.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:00):**  But I think that conversation, like, you know, when you start talking about things like the  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:04):**  first principle is you have a body.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:06):**  When you start talking at that level, it was like a level of connection that it just, you  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:11):**  know, if someone if you're going to get on with someone at that point.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:15):**  So we just really connected, I think.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:17):**  I think of you as my sister from another mister.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:22):**  That was certainly an instant connection, and I think, too, we had a consulting version  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:27):**  of an app that only the consulting team was using.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:31):**  And the platform we were using was quite clunky.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:34):**  So Abby really helped to resolve an issue that we had.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:37):**  And we transferred all of that consulting level information into Abby's platform.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:43):**  And then we're like, this is far too overwhelming for most producers who are not interested  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:49):**  in that level of delving in.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:51):**  And then that kept exploring this conversation around how do we simplify this and make it  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:56):**  really, really valuable.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:15:57):**  And if you had to just choose 10 indicators, what would they look like?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:02):**  And then what does it mean?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:04):**  And then what potentially can we do?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:06):**  And I think that's the missing with a lot of data is it's just data for data's sake.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:10):**  And people just have piles of information that doesn't either doesn't inform the future or  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:15):**  it lags too far behind to give you anything that offers real value.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:20):**  And I know people that have like 30 years of monitoring data on their places and it  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:24):**  really means nothing.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:25):**  It's just a navel gazing exercise.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:27):**  So Abby really takes that to the next level.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:30):**  And so why?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:31):**  Now, go ahead.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:32):**  Good.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:33):**  No, I was gonna say together, like that's what the Soil Mentor Regen platform is really.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:37):**  And that's where things get serious, I feel like, because it's one thing being able to  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:43):**  go and look at a hole and record how many earthworms there are.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:48):**  But the missing, the next level, which is what the Regen platform brings and what Nicole  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:52):**  brings essentially is like, OK, your earthworm number is 20.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:16:58):**  Is that pretty good?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:00):**  OK, or not so good compared to what we would expect from your soil type, your climate?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:06):**  And what might you do about it?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:08):**  Like what questions might you ask yourself from a regenerative standpoint?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:12):**  And I think, you know, taking people that step further, two steps further, really, is  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:18):**  a huge leap compared to like where most things leave you, especially with data.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:25):**  So I think, yeah, it's been really exciting to see how that's empowering farmers kind  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:31):**  of to start to take themselves to the next step to a certain extent.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah, I think that triggering that question and getting rid of the data for data sake,  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:42):**  I mean, you can you can drone your property all you want or send everything to the lab  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:48):**  you want.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:49):**  But if it doesn't influence any decision after or triggers any question or it's it's a very  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:55):**  expensive hobby.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:56):**  And so how do you trigger it?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:17:57):**  How do you take that from these 10 indicators?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:00):**  We can walk through them.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:01):**  I mean, they're on the website.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:02):**  I definitely put the link below.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:03):**  So you had to simplify it to 10.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:06):**  How difficult was it?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:07):**  Let's first of all start with the question.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:08):**  Like, how difficult is it for you, Nicole, or you both, Abby and Nicole, to pick 10?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:14):**  Like what was the what was the long list?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:16):**  And how did we end up with 10 of these?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:18):**  And why are these, let's say, the best proxies or the best web that captures hopefully the  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:23):**  80 20 or 90 10 or whatever of what we want to see?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:26):**  Yeah, it's a really good question, because there's so much to look at.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:30):**  And I think sometimes people don't realize how dynamic and how many measures there are  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:34):**  for soil.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:35):**  A lot of them are interrelated.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:37):**  So if we take like aggregate stability or what we call this laking test as an example,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:43):**  how that little crumb seems so insignificant, how does that hold together?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:48):**  Tells you so much about greenhouse gas emissions, your nitrogen cycle, sedimentation and waterways,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:55):**  the ability for water and air and gas to diffuse through a soil.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:18:59):**  And you get that just from this one little crumb.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:02):**  So for me, there's a couple of that these absolutely have to be on the list.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:06):**  And then we I think we got down to maybe like eight that we were really clear that we could  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:10):**  agree on these.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:11):**  And then what would be some of the extras and like China go, oh, maybe we need 12, Abby.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:17):**  But you know, we really got there.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:20):**  And it was fun.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:21):**  Yeah, I don't find we didn't have too much challenges with it.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:24):**  The challenge is trying to pin me down.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:29):**  I didn't hear Laura to have 12, like one for every month, like something like 10 is a good  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:35):**  number.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:37):**  One of the experiences we do have over the years with soilmentor and working with farmers  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:43):**  in the field is like there is, you know, simplicity and ease are important.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:51):**  And I know, you know, Nicole knows that as well.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:19:54):**  But it's like it is such a different perspective to the consultant or the coach coming in.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:00):**  What a farmer will actually do in the field, obviously, you know, they have so many other  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:04):**  priorities all the time.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:06):**  So keeping it to 10, it just so why not eight?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:10):**  I mean, if you already got to eight, well, from my experience, you could say why not  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:15):**  one and then you get down the path of like carbon as the sole indicator of soil health.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:22):**  So we do you do need to find a balance of not oversimplifying things.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:30):**  So we were trying to keep the complexity there whilst also having some form of simplicity.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:38):**  I mean, I don't know.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:39):**  What do you think, Nicole?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:40):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:41):**  And to make it still give really good insights.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:47):**  One of the things we created, which I haven't seen before, was this idea of the bricks barometer.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:52):**  So bricks is a measurement of how well is a plant capturing sunlight energy, which is  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:56):**  the very purpose of being on the planet.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:20:59):**  It's why we can live here.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:01):**  But what we find is most systems are very disabled as such dysfunctional.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:07):**  And what you find is whoever's capturing the most sunlight energy is often the plants that  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:12):**  are least desired.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:13):**  So you could call these weeds, for instance.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:16):**  But we find as those plants will be so we can measure this using a refractometer and  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:20):**  looking at bricks as a measurement of sugars and dissolved solids.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:26):**  And whoever's got the highest amount of those materials is then able to pump more sugars  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:32):**  out the roots, is then able to influence the microbial community around those roots.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:37):**  And so what we find is people have a higher sunlight capture in the plants that they don't  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:42):**  want and very low in their commercial crops or what they do want.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:46):**  And so the wider that gap, the more of an indicator is that this system is dysfunctional.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:51):**  That who you are farming for are the weeds.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:55):**  Who you're farming for is disease.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:21:57):**  Who you're farming for is a lack of nutrient density in the crops that you're producing.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:01):**  So I was excited to see that being developed.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:05):**  I think that's a good resource.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:07):**  So how, like these 10 indicators, how easy are they for a general farmer?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:14):**  There's no general farmer, but for a general person to do that, is it literally I dig a  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:18):**  hole and then I do it?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:19):**  I mean, you're now mentioning bricks meters.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:21):**  How complex is it to, or what's the barrier to entry in this?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:27):**  I want to start, I'm downloading the app, I become a customer or a client or partner,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:31):**  whatever we call it.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:32):**  And then what do I need to get the 10?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:35):**  Or can I get eight right out of the gate and I need to order some other things to do 10?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:40):**  Or do I need to ship something somewhere?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:43):**  What's the process for a newbie, let's say.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:46):**  So actually the majority of them you can do with just a spade.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:53):**  So and we've done it that way on purpose.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:55):**  The idea is that it's easy to go and do out in the field.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:22:59):**  The refractometer is in all your fields, I'm assuming like you want to do it regularly  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:05):**  and spaciously regularly, let's say over if you have a larger farm to see differences  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:11):**  or would you recommend one?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:13):**  No, I would recommend multiple I'm imagining.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:16):**  I mean, different metrics have different frequencies like the bricks barometer, you could, I don't  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:20):**  know what Nicole would say, but you could easily do that every week and potentially  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:24):**  learn something from it.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:25):**  I don't know.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:26):**  Nicole's definitely better at answering that question than me.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:31):**  But in terms of, yeah, the only test that you have to send away to a lab is actually  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:36):**  the carbon stocks.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:38):**  And that's because obviously carbon stocks are really important.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:42):**  They're part of the picture.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:44):**  And so we did want to include one lab based test in there.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:49):**  So you can, you know, it's getting this whole picture.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:51):**  But the majority of the tests are, yeah, just go out and get started, I would say.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:23:59):**  And so there's no barrier to that in terms of you don't have to have that equipment and  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:03):**  you don't have to send it to the lab to still start these processes and you might go, all  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:08):**  right, well, I have time for this one measure.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:11):**  Well, just take that one measure and you're still starting to build up your knowledge  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:15):**  bank as such.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:16):**  And producers are really busy and, you know, it depends what scale they're on.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:22):**  They don't always have the time for things like this.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:24):**  So just being able to set aside that time and it is something really fun.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:28):**  I really encourage producers to go out with their family, you know, counting worms with  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:32):**  your kids.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:33):**  Ah, so fun.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:34):**  We were, Abby, you'll like this.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:37):**  We were out in the field two days ago and we saw something we've never seen before,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:42):**  which I always love.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:43):**  But they were dung beetles that had mites all over them, like all over them.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:48):**  And I'm like, oh gosh, I don't know if this is a good thing.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:50):**  I was wondering, are they decay mites?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:52):**  Is that what they are?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:55):**  Sure enough, they are.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:56):**  So we Googled it.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:24:58):**  And these dung beetles actually have these little hitchhikers who will go with them to  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:02):**  the next cow pie.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:03):**  And then they are eating, um, root feeding nematodes and pest organisms in the soil,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:08):**  which is really, really cool.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:10):**  Um, but just even to do something like that, you want to watch a bunch of adult squeal  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:15):**  like little kids when we, we discover something like that.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:18):**  It was so fun.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:22):**  And then how do you capture that in one of the 10?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:23):**  No, I don't think it was a question.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:24):**  It was one of the ones that was left out.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:27):**  But for good reasons.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:28):**  It's the curiosity, right?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:29):**  And the interesting thing is that I've been with producers that, that really value soil  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:33):**  health have never dug a hole or things like dung beetles, you know, they've never even  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:39):**  seen, well, you have five different species of dung beetles and this is what they look  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:43):**  like.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:44):**  And to see people just light up and connect more deeply.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:47):**  And I think for me, that's a big part of software is that we can actually use that as a behavioral  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:53):**  change tool to, to connect because people will dig a hole and they go, well, it looks  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:25:57):**  like dirt and I don't know what I'm looking at.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:00):**  And so, yeah, you dug a hole, but actually let's, let's keep building on this educational  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:07):**  space and we, we can't be everywhere at all times.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:10):**  So actually having a process that works people through the educational portion is so exciting.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:17):**  And captures the data and stores it so you can go back in time.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:19):**  I mean, then it becomes interesting to, to see the lines going somewhere or at least  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:24):**  the directions, if you dug the hole more or less at the same location, of course, not  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:28):**  exactly the same.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:30):**  And then, I mean, you're capturing as a farmer, these 10 or whatever the number is at that  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:35):**  point you had time for, but like a robust set of data.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:39):**  How do we make sure it's not data for data's sake?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:42):**  Like how do we then influence the farming practice or decisions that I need to take  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:49):**  to go out in the field tomorrow?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:50):**  Like how do, how do we translate that because that sounded like your ambition to make sure  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:55):**  it changes something on the field, except that there's a hole.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:26:59):**  Like what, what does, how do you influence management decisions that farmers need to  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:02):**  take daily basically with the data they, in this case, capture themselves?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:10):**  So, I mean, the app, I would say, you know, the app is there to take you so far.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:13):**  So it will basically show you a soil health scorecard.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:17):**  So you see all of your results in a scorecard and each result also will have a color behind  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:22):**  it.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:23):**  So it shows you like, oh look, actually an earthworm score of 12 in this type of soil  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:28):**  for this type of climate is actually in the red.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:32):**  And then you can click into that and that's where it's like Nicole pops up.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:38):**  Maybe one day we'll have it.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:39):**  So we have a little mini Nicole there.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:41):**  Video.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:42):**  Like a halo, like a halo, a hologram on your field.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:46):**  She's there.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:47):**  Point your phone now to the field and Nicole will show up.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:27:55):**  We're working on it, but for now it's just, it's text-based Nicole.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:01):**  So you get to see your, visually you're seeing colors in terms of like, where do you sit  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:07):**  as a benchmark?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:09):**  You also get to see where do you, how do you compare with all the other farmers on the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:12):**  platform who have your soil and your climate essentially.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:17):**  So you will then see, it's just like a box and whisker plot.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:20):**  So it's not, you can't tell much about other people, but you can certainly tell how do  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:25):**  you compare with all the other results coming in.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:29):**  And then the next bit is where Nicole then explains this result.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:35):**  So this earthworm number may be because of X, Y, and Z.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:39):**  And then also literally feeds some questions that my understanding is that Nicole, you  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:45):**  would be asking, or one of your coaches that just came off the create course would be asking  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:49):**  at that point.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:50):**  It's like, okay, well what are the questions to ask right now?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:53):**  And so, yeah, I guess the app feeds you that.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:28:57):**  Because if we, if we step back a little bit or up, what we are going through right now  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:02):**  is an evolution, an evolution in consciousness and evolution in how we work with landscapes,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:07):**  education, health, everything's shifting right now.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:10):**  And we're working away from this expert model, which is I have the answer and you should  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:15):**  listen to me.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:16):**  And what that has created is, and I'm sending your inputs usually.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:23):**  So, so farmers have been trained to lose that curiosity, lose the art, lose the joy.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:28):**  And here someone's going to come and tell you, you need to put on 200 kilograms because  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:31):**  that's the answer.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:32):**  And so very much this app is, have you considered this?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:36):**  Have you thought about this?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:38):**  Has this, has this been happening to continue to open up the observation and open up the  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:42):**  critical thinking because that's what's required.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:45):**  We don't need people out there who have the answer and the technology that's going to  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:49):**  save the day because that's what we've been living through for the last 120 years.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:53):**  And that model doesn't work.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:54):**  So how do we, how do we create adaptive creative thinkers?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:29:59):**  And that's part of what this app does is just kind of feed into your curiosity.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:04):**  So basically by triggering questions based on very real examples, amount of earthworms,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:11):**  where earth percentage, et cetera, et cetera, bricks, barometer, you're trying to trigger  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:15):**  curiosity instead of giving one answer, which you can't because that's what we've been trying  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:20):**  for 120 or probably more years.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:22):**  And that's impossible, but you're basically trying to trigger somebody, nudge somebody  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:27):**  to keep asking questions until they figure out the answer that works in their context.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:32):**  And then hopefully keeps using the app and capture the changes in these indicators.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:37):**  And thus you, do you monitor that as well?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:40):**  Like do you, like, okay, maybe this is too early, but like what, where virtual Nicole,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:46):**  text-based Nicole is triggering the right questions?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:49):**  Like what's the response sort of there?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:51):**  Like people click through or how do you know it's working?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:55):**  Or do you know if people keep using the app, they are happy clients?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:30:59):**  Like how do we know this is leading to, because it is using technology in this way and it's  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:04):**  not having one of the consultants or one of the coaches that you've trained in the field.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:09):**  It is, there's a layer in between, which is maybe more powerful and maybe less powerful.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:12):**  Like how do we know this is, this is working and creates this army of, of curiosity?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:18):**  Well, I mean, partially I would say, yeah, it's about people using the app and continuing  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:23):**  to use it.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:24):**  Obviously, you know then that it's creating value.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:28):**  But I would also say that we only, so it only was released in January for the first time.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:34):**  So it's very much an evolving learning process.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:38):**  And I actually personally see it as very much, and I think Nicole sees it the same, like  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:44):**  it's about taking farmers that extra step, but I do still like from my experience of  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:48):**  people going through the regenerative transition, actually the coach is a hugely important role,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:54):**  probably for quite different things than people use consultants for today.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:31:58):**  So it's not to tell you what to apply, but it's to be there to like support you through  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:03):**  your questioning essentially.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:05):**  So the app will start with these questions.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:07):**  It gives you some links.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:08):**  You can go like explore more, learn more, watch videos, read information.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:13):**  And then the coach is there to be like your sounding board to talk to, to help guide you  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:18):**  through that process and give you the confidence you need.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:21):**  Because I do think it's not fair to just give an app to a farmer, give them some questions  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:26):**  and then be like, okay, off you go.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:28):**  Good luck.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:29):**  Good luck.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:30):**  But that's, I think the difference between a coach and a consultant, like that the coach  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:34):**  will, a good coach, I think will never tell you what to do, but will trigger enough questions  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:39):**  that you will figure out your path and will be there with you or give you enough confidence  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:43):**  to ask those questions to begin with.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:46):**  And was it before you, I mean, you mentioned Nicole, that it was part of the work you already  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:51):**  did in another app.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:32:52):**  Like was it a huge work like to sort of text, like capture you or capture your coaching,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:00):**  your style in text and to make it easily accessible and not overwhelming, but also not too simplified.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:06):**  Like how difficult was that to go from here are 10 things in here, how you can measure  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:11):**  these and how you can have these indicators to, okay, let's trigger people with questions  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:16):**  and make sure they hit a nerve because then we get somewhere.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:19):**  Yeah, there's kind of two parts because part of it was really exciting in terms of making  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:24):**  the implicit explicit.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:26):**  How do we take some of these observations for me, which feel very intuitive, feel like  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:32):**  I'm on the landscape, I'm reading the person, I'm reading the land, I'm reading the animals  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:36):**  and then to reduce that and put it into words.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:39):**  I'm like, no, like that, that part was really challenging.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:43):**  It's like this needs to be an expansive process.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:45):**  Because words are so flat.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:48):**  They're not, they're not, there's no, there's no, there's no, yeah, there's no 3D.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:51):**  There's no depth at all.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:53):**  You can explain it in 10 different ways and you would never know because somebody is going  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:33:56):**  to be somewhere in the UK or somewhere in Italy looking at a screen and think, or her  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:01):**  screen and think, what does this mean?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:04):**  And so that was the fun of it.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:05):**  Like how do we, how do we make it as simple as possible without making it, without dumbing  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:10):**  it down.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:11):**  But also, you know, measures like what does soil smell like and how would you even be  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:16):**  able to rate that on a scale?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:18):**  It's quite simple to do that.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:20):**  And what's really interesting, they did a study in California and they got a large number  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:24):**  of people to smell soil that range from good to bad.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:29):**  And it didn't matter if you were a child or if you were academic or if you had never garden  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:34):**  in your life or you were a master gardener, people could rate soil from bad to good across  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:40):**  the board.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:41):**  We have an inbuilt sense of what good soil should smell like.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:47):**  And that's fascinating.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:49):**  What's really cool is so geosmin, which is the odor of the earth, what you smell on  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:34:53):**  a hot summer day, if there's a shower of rain, that smell, we can smell that at 200,000 times  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:00):**  the concentration of what a shark can smell, a drop of blood in an Olympic swimming pool.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:06):**  Like how wild is that?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:08):**  So we are tuned into soil, I believe, because it's where we come from.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:14):**  It's the mother.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:15):**  It's the source of life on the planet.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:17):**  It's the reason that we're here and we can smell it, which I just think is extraordinary.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:22):**  So is smell one of the 10 indicators?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:24):**  Yes.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:25):**  Or not?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:26):**  It is.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:27):**  It's not one of the 10.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:28):**  It's on the recent plate.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:29):**  Sorry.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:30):**  It's on the 10.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:31):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:32):**  Because the smelling part, I was going to say, because at the beginning you dig a hole  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:37):**  and you look and I was almost going to say you smell, you smell, but luckily it came  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:40):**  up now.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:41):**  Like smelling is a very powerful sensor.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:43):**  And apparently we're in a to really understand what's better soil and not.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:49):**  So we that's that's it's very encouraging that even after 120 years of very chemical  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:55):**  input agriculture, we're still able to do that.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:35:57):**  We might have lost some taste, but or have to reset our tasting system a bit.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:01):**  But the smell from COVID.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:04):**  Yeah, that's not a good thing.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:06):**  Yeah, that's a very interesting one as well.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:08):**  So to dumb that down, dumb that down, quote unquote, obviously, you said it was fun and  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:12):**  challenging.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:14):**  And then did you also see it as it's almost a threat for your your coaches and you as  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:19):**  well?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:20):**  Like if suddenly the technology, the app would fix everything.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:23):**  Have you ever ever pop up or have you had discussions with yourself or among your organization  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:28):**  in with that?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:30):**  It's so funny.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:31):**  I did a industry brainstorming session about this in 2006 in New Zealand.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:38):**  And and people have said to me, why would you coach coaches?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:40):**  They're going to take your job.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:42):**  They're going to take away business that's leading to you.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:45):**  Why would you do that?  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:46):**  Or why would you write it down in a book?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:47):**  If any of those thoughts are popping up for people about competition, about scarcity, you  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:53):**  are no longer regenerative.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:36:54):**  You just jumped back into the old paradigm of the old model of business and competition  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:01):**  and threats and all of that.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:02):**  So a huge part of really being regenerative is shifting those contexts.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:08):**  There is no such thing as scarcity and competition in this world.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:12):**  And you can see the massive expansion of regenerative agriculture right now.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:16):**  We need more people understanding and doing this work deeply.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:20):**  And I want to put it in every single person's hands.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:22):**  And actually, if I can make myself defunct, I'm just going to go live in the mountains  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:26):**  and ride my horse and I'll be very happy doing that.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:28):**  I'll be done.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:29):**  I'm like, oh, good.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:30):**  My work is done.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:31):**  You'll be fine.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:32):**  Yeah, I'll find something else to irritate people with.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:36):**  And it's that ability to pivot or be resilient is what we need to be building in people.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:43):**  How do we respond if someone else starts to offer something that you're doing and might  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:47):**  take your market share?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:49):**  It's like, well, then you're not offering something truly unique and continually learning  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:53):**  and expanding yourself.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:37:55):**  And do you feel like this two-step approach, maybe there are multiple steps, but this approach,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:00):**  and I say you, but depending on who wants to take this question, of triggering, obviously,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:05):**  the indicators and starting with that, and then with the questions triggering this curiosity  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:09):**  mind or this beginner's mind or this regenerative think, is that enough to, or have you seen  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:15):**  that already now?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:16):**  Or is that what you're thinking there enough to trigger that mindset?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:19):**  And because you mentioned on the website specifically, we want to trigger a regenerative mindset  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:24):**  and to farm regeneratively, we need much more than different indicators and different practices.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:29):**  We need to start, like we said now, actually, to work in an economic system, regenerative  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:35):**  economic system.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:36):**  We need to switch mindset quite strongly.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:39):**  Do you see that this is triggering people to do that?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:42):**  Do you have examples since January?  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:44):**  It's very short.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:45):**  We're at the end of April now, 2022.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:46):**  Do you have any interesting stories there?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:49):**  Is it too early there?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:50):**  Is it, what do you see?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:51):**  What do you feel?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:53):**  Any case studies that come to mind?  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:55):**  Or is this too early and we need to come back in a year or so?  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:38:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:00):**  I mean, I think that to me, that's like, that is the question.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:02):**  It's the most massive question possible.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:05):**  And to me, this is just the very beginning.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:10):**  And it's just a small part of the regenerative mindset change.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:13):**  So I would never kind of want to assume that the app was going to change someone's whole  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:18):**  life.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:19):**  I mean, we're talking about a whole life change here in my mind.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:22):**  It's not just, you know, building soil health.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:26):**  It's like, as Nicole said about the Create course, like people are going on this course  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:30):**  and it's like literally, you know, unearthing yourself as well as this regenerative transition.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:37):**  So I think, you know, the app is a small part of that.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:40):**  And where I think is interesting is that for many people, this transitioning or the soil  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:46):**  health learning and investigation and the biodiversity learning and investigation is  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:50):**  actually an amazing place to start.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:54):**  And I've seen that time and time again, as people start down the path, like probably,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:39:59):**  you know, myself included in many ways, you start in a direction and it unfurls this world  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:06):**  of possibility where actually what's happening below the ground in the soil is all of these  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:11):**  connections and all of this like magic in inverted commas that we haven't been tapping  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:18):**  into.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:19):**  You know, it's this, it's the flourishing.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:21):**  It's that abundance that is the opposite of the scarcity, that is the opposite of the  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:27):**  competition.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:28):**  It's all about the collaboration.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:29):**  And once you start to see that working below ground, I think you do, you know, and suddenly  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:33):**  your plants are just like going wild.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:35):**  Like these cover crops are just like so bountiful.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:39):**  It does start to have people move in this direction of like, oh wow, okay.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:44):**  Like it just starts to open up a crack of what's possible.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:48):**  And so I think that would be, yeah, to me that is the regenerative transition.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:55):**  And I think that's what we're all aiming for.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:57):**  I don't know.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:40:59):**  And for me, it's been really interesting to be training people that have already been  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:04):**  teaching mindset, have already been teaching regenerative agriculture and for them to say,  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:09):**  I teach this and I never shifted my own mindset.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:13):**  I'm like, oh, mind blowing.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:16):**  You know, that piece is that really that deep, deep connection into shifting how everything  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:24):**  in the world occurs to you.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:26):**  And I don't think any app is ever going to be able to do that.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:28):**  But part of what we're seeing is this arising of groups that are mentoring each other, that  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:37):**  we're seeing farmer hubs forming where people are, I guess, troubleshooting in their own  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:42):**  context, in their own area and starting to ask deeper and deeper and deeper why questions.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:49):**  And I think that's the mycelial learning network.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:52):**  That's what we're seeing shifting across the planet.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:55):**  So it's not an app or an academic or somebody else that's got the answer.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:41:59):**  But what's cool about this, the Regen platform is that it just provides a guidance and a  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:06):**  platform and a structure to what can seem very overwhelming.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:10):**  And especially if you're working with a whole lot of people that are all very new to this,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:16):**  let's not fall back or lose confidence.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:20):**  That's kind of the piece of just supporting confidence to know that we are moving forward.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:24):**  And thinking back to this collaborative piece, if we don't collaborate, we're in some serious  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:30):**  trouble right now.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:31):**  And climate change is not being driven by carbon, in my mind.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:36):**  That's not a climate change issue.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:37):**  We're going to grow more plants probably with a whole lot of carbon.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:40):**  The issue is that we have totally degraded ecosystems that have destroyed small and large  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:45):**  water cycles and are affecting climate dramatically.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:50):**  And it takes 100,000 hectare parcels to get together that we can actually modify or geo  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:57):**  engineer climate.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:42:58):**  So it's taking a collaborative approach to we need to be managing land, all of us together  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:04):**  to deal with some of these hugely complex issues and that we have degraded ecosystem  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:09):**  services across the planet.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:10):**  So I could go on and on.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:12):**  I shall stop.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:13):**  And it's fascinating.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:15):**  And do you enable that mycelium to grow as well?  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:19):**  Like between farms, you say you allow farmers to look at each other, look at each other,  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:23):**  not the right word, to compare to others.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:26):**  Is it anonymized?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:27):**  Is that like, oh, I would love to connect with this farmer with this type of soil in  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:32):**  the same climate because he or she might be nearby or not nearby, but nearby mentally  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:36):**  because we're farming the same time, but he might be or she might be on the other side  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:40):**  of the world, which is great because I can WhatsApp or whatever technology I use.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:44):**  How do you enable, if you are or you're thinking about it, that mycelium to start connecting  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:50):**  and then the carbon, the sugars, the nutrients, the vitamins, et cetera, to start flowing  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:55):**  between the two nodes, if the metaphor works here?  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:43:58):**  Yeah, that worked.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:02):**  So the way, well, we are actually seeing some of those kind of non-localized but mindset  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:08):**  based groups forming.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:10):**  So for example, across the UK, Pasture for Life have got a group of farmers all working  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:17):**  in the same way, using the Regen platform, connected by WhatsApp or the forums.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:23):**  Whatever works.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:24):**  Yeah, whatever works.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:26):**  And then they are working together to do the different monitoring and then coming back  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:33):**  to compare and shift things together.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:38):**  Working together like that is amazingly powerful.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:41):**  So the app absolutely can help you do that.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:43):**  We do have group setups or organizational setups so that you can have lots of different  
**[0:44:49-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:49):**  farms on the same setup.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:51):**  And then we do also have something in the pipeline, which is specifically for farmer  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:44:59):**  groups who want to be sharing all of their data pretty much, because the app assumes  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:05):**  that farmers don't want to share much of their data.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:08):**  It assumes that every farmer owns all their data and that that's very much theirs and  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:13):**  we're not here to compromise that in any way.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:16):**  And so you can, when I said you can compare, you can only see like, am I in the bottom  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:24):**  25% or the top 50%?  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:26):**  Or am I top of every farmer who has my soil type and climate?  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:30):**  But beyond that, you can't actually tell much more, anything more.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:33):**  So for smaller groups of farmers who do actually want to share much more data than that, we  
**[0:45:40-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:40):**  do have a farmer group comparison tool that's in the works.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:48):**  And yeah, that will make it so that you can like literally compare from the field that  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:52):**  we visited last week as a group, you know, oh look, their earthworm count is this, their  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:45:58):**  rhizosheets are that.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:01):**  How does that compare to my field that I've managed differently?  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:03):**  Maybe I could try managing in that way.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:05):**  So for me, it's always about this physical digital combination.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:10):**  How can we combine those like groups that are in real life going to visit each other's  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:14):**  farms with those on-farm observations that they're making potentially individually, and  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:20):**  then combining all of that to learn from it and discuss together, okay, well, how might  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:25):**  we do things differently?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:26):**  Or maybe I could do like Fiona did on her field or whatever that is.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:31):**  And the fact that you assume that farmers don't want to share that data, is there a  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:36):**  way like maybe they do, or there is a way to trigger that partially anonymized or obviously  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:43):**  opt in?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:44):**  I mean, we're not going to share any data that doesn't want to be shared, but there's  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:46):**  an enormous interesting trigger there to see if you're in the top not, or to see just to  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:53):**  connect over these dashboards and to start obviously, for sure people are screenshotting  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:46:58):**  it and sharing it in WhatsApp, like look what happens here, etc.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:01):**  Like to encourage that more, because then we get to real connections than it is about  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:06):**  something is that not only in small groups that already know each other, but also among  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:11):**  others obviously always looking at privacy and data ownership.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:17):**  What are your thoughts there?  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:18):**  I mean, this is super, super fresh.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:19):**  We're four months in, but still.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:20):**  I don't know, Nicole, do you have any thoughts on that?  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:23):**  Well, part of what I'm seeing is that people that have been involved in regenerative ag  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:28):**  for a while are more savvy about the value of data, at least I hope so.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:34):**  What we're seeing is that data is becoming one of the most valuable commodities on the  
**[0:47:39-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:39):**  planet, which is why we teamed up with Abby and the Soil Mentor, because that data isn't  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:47):**  being mined.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:48):**  It's not being used to make decisions that take that out of people's hands.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:52):**  I know that some of the biggest companies in the world right now are looking at how  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:47:56):**  do you make money off the agricultural landscape, and that totally subjugates or goes around  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:02):**  producers.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:04):**  I think there's a concern about if I put all my data out there, someone's going to take  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:08):**  that and they're going to potentially use it for evil.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:14):**  We've got to stop farming the farmers.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:16):**  We've got to start acknowledging the contribution that they're doing or acknowledging the fact  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:21):**  that they are the builders of infrastructure on the planet.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:25):**  They are the conservatives.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:27):**  What's been happening forever is just rape and pillage, take every single cent off those  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:31):**  producers.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:32):**  That's why we have landscapes so dysfunctional is it's very hard to think outside the box  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:39):**  when you're under so much stress from debt, under so much stress from legislation and  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:42):**  all these pressures on producers.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:44):**  I really feel that they have the very strong right to keep that data to themselves.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:50):**  What I'm seeing is group hubs so that the hubs are sharing that information, but it's  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:55):**  not out there in the public domain space.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:48:59):**  Maybe that'll change.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:00):**  Maybe the whole world will actually go through this paradigm shift that I hope they will  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:03):**  and it becomes something that benefits the producers.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:08):**  You could argue that this data is of all of us.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:13):**  In some countries like Norway, your tax data is public.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:17):**  It really depends how you frame that or how we go through that.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:24):**  Of course, not to be mined and not to be sold to XYZ, but should we all know what's happening  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:30):**  in our landscapes?  
**[0:49:31-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:31):**  I'm saying our as the full planet.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:34):**  Is that or should it really be because I happen to be lucky enough to own this land, which  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:40):**  we can ask a lot of questions about, then I should also be owner of that data.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:44):**  I don't know.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:45):**  Is that true or should we go through a transition or an evolution to question that as well?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:54):**  I have a concrete example that really solidified my thinking on this, which was that early  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:49:58):**  days I learned that every farmer in the UK has to pay a tariff essentially on all of  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:05):**  their wheat that they sell, every bushel or oats.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:08):**  That goes to a centralized organization in the UK, a farming organization.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:14):**  Then that organization takes all of the data from all of those bushel sold, puts it all  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:20):**  together and makes it open source and available.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:24):**  When you really look at who benefits from that data, it is not the farmers.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:29):**  The farmers are paying for that data to be dealt with and collected, but the people who  
**[0:50:33-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:33):**  benefit are the traders essentially or the investors or the huge... I know people who  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:40):**  create the software that draws on all of that data around the world, puts it together and  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:45):**  then sells it as trading information.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:49):**  They make a heck of a lot of money off of it.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:51):**  I tell you, it's amazing.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:52):**  Who knew?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:55):**  For me, what I learned from that was like, okay, I get it.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:50:59):**  That data is valuable.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:00):**  It's not necessarily compromising the farmer's integrity in the sense that it's not location-based  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:05):**  and it's not saying this farmer does this, but it's valuable data in the aggregate for  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:10):**  someone somewhere.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:12):**  If this data is going to be valuable in the aggregate, then for me, I think the farmer  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:17):**  should be able to opt in and they should get paid for it, or they should have some sort  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:22):**  of financial remuneration for the fact that they helped collect that data and that it's  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:28):**  providing value elsewhere in this supply chain.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:32):**  That's the position that we've taken, which is that it is the farmer's data.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:39):**  If somehow we come up with some agreement with someone and we're going to do an aggregate  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:44):**  data share or we would like to, then that will be the farmer's choice whether they want  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:47):**  to participate in that.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:49):**  My hope would be that there would be a way of passing... I would make sure that there's  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:51:54):**  a way of compensating throughout back to the farm gate, essentially.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:00):**  Speaking of this, what would you say... Imagine again, we're in a theater, we're doing this  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:06):**  live and the room is full of, let's say, people that consider themselves smart investors that  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:11):**  are hearing this, like, we love the technology approach.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:15):**  Obviously agriculture landscapes have to transition.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:18):**  I've asked this question already to Abby, so I'm going to ask it to Nicole.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:20):**  What would you tell, obviously without giving investment advice, which is not what we're  
**[0:52:23-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:23):**  doing here, but what would you tell them to look at the moment they walk out of the theater  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:29):**  and they are, of course, super inspired.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:30):**  They're going to read the book or they already did.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:32):**  They're going to look at a lot of documentaries.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:33):**  They're going to visit some farms, but then where should they start literally and not  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:38):**  literally digging deeper?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:40):**  What are pieces of this regenerative transition that you're so deep into that really could  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:45):**  use some, say, investor energy or resources or places where... Then I'm going to ask  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:52):**  the question where you would put money to work, but first of all, let's address the  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:55):**  audience.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:56):**  What should they do the moment they walk out of this theater?  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:52:59):**  For me, I think it's very interesting in terms of, I think as human beings, we're attracted  
**[0:53:04-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:04):**  to the big and the shiny and maybe the technology and the, oh, look what I made.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:13):**  Look what I'm doing.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:14):**  And where we really need to be focused in on is how do we really empower people?  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:21):**  How do we really make a difference?  
**[0:53:24-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:24):**  Investing in education, investing in training people to think, to be able to be this creative  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:32):**  space.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:33):**  It's not as sexy, but that's what's truly going to make an impact in the world because  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:37):**  that one person that you've now empowered and they're out in the world, you don't know  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:41):**  what the impact of that person could be.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:43):**  And it could be absolutely massive.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:45):**  I mean, I think just me as one person, I speak to potentially over 10,000 people in a year.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:53):**  I'm working with over 24 million acres with behavior change programs.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:53:59):**  That's what we need to be investing in is not me, although you can, that would be great,  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:04):**  but investing in those people that are really shifting the context, that are really shifting  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:10):**  the paradigms.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:11):**  And perhaps that starts with educational centers.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:15):**  But what I see, like right now there's the carbon smart $1 billion that the American  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:20):**  government is putting out and what they're looking for is products and practices.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:26):**  That is not going to make the difference.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:27):**  If you just invest in a practice, you can make that practice degenerative in a heartbeat.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:32):**  The practice is guided by our philosophy and our principles.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:35):**  We need to be working on those higher philosophies so that it becomes abhorrent to come out and  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:42):**  use Paraquat and 2,4-D and other chemicals to terminate a cover crop.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:47):**  And you go, oh look, I grew a cover crop.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:49):**  I'm regenerative.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:51):**  That's the piece that's really got to shift.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:53):**  So I think for investors to be looking at where are the change agents and how do we  
**[0:54:57-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:54:57):**  get under and make a difference with them?  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:00):**  Because they're the ones making the difference on the ground.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:03):**  And sorry, that's not very sexy.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:06):**  And then let's flip the question to you.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:08):**  So let's say you're an investor and I mean, you knew this question was coming, but you  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:12):**  have a billion dollars to put to work and I'm not looking for exact dollar amounts.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:16):**  I'm looking for what would you prioritize?  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:20):**  How would you put that money to work?  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:22):**  It's as an investment.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:23):**  Definitely, there could be some grants here and there, but predominantly to put it to  
**[0:55:28-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:28):**  work and at some point it should come back ideally.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:32):**  What would you approach first?  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:34):**  What would you do first tomorrow morning if you put on your investor hat?  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:40):**  I think I would really like to invest with some large scale projects that really demonstrate  
**[0:55:45-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:45):**  how we can alter climate.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:49):**  So we're looking at that 100,000 hectare blocks where we can really demonstrate how does this  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:56):**  affect downstream?  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:55:57):**  How is this affecting everybody else?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:01):**  And then the education piece.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:02):**  So there are more and more regenerative ag centers being set up.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:07):**  What I'd like to see, and it's the same with the NRCS here in the US, I want to see them  
**[0:56:11-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:11):**  being trained in the mindset piece.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:13):**  So what does it take to get some of these schools of thought into the people that are  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:18):**  already on the ground?  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:19):**  There's 140,000 people working for the NRCS.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:23):**  If they shifted their context and their mindset, whoa, what would be possible just here in  
**[0:56:28-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:28):**  the US?  
**[0:56:29-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:29):**  So yeah, that's where I would like to be investing.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:33):**  And you're mentioning 100,000 because it's a nice big number or because there's a thought  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:39):**  behind it, like that's the minimum we need to hit to hit the climate.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:44):**  That's the minimum we need to hit to see this engineering of climate.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:49):**  I hate that word engineering.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:50):**  I need a new word.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:51):**  To see this differential start to happen, see cloud formation, see volatile organic  
**[0:56:57-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:56:57):**  compounds, to see that whole surface start to raise water and to change climate.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:05):**  So yeah, there's some pretty good research to show that's the minimum that you need to  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:08):**  be able to start influencing downwind.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:11):**  And how would you approach that then with a billion dollars?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:14):**  I'm imagining from a non-regenerative mindset you wouldn't buy up all the land.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:18):**  How would you do it?  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:20):**  And in case, where would you start?  
**[0:57:21-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:21):**  Do you have an ideal landscape in mind for 100,000 hectares we're talking about or acres?  
**[0:57:27-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:27):**  Hectares.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:29):**  It would have to be absolutely collaborative.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:31):**  It would have to involve justice and equity and indigenous people in this space.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:35):**  So looking at what does it look like to restore these ecosystems.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:39):**  And there's so many partners out there right now that are asking the same question to develop  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:44):**  a collaborative model.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:45):**  So no, this wouldn't be, oh, all this land is owned by some guy who flies to Mars.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:51):**  That's not what we're interested in doing.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:53):**  It's not about the ownership of that land, but the collaboration.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:57:56):**  And we've seen some great projects in New Mexico and in China and Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:04):**  There's projects that are starting to do this, but definitely it has to involve entire communities  
**[0:58:10-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:10):**  and have community buy in.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:13):**  And so we're seeing some interesting stuff here where I am in Big Timber in Montana is  
**[0:58:17-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:17):**  that just through the actions of one producer, we're seeing 50% of the land area in a 10  
**[0:58:24-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:24):**  mile radius changing their management practices and moving towards adaptive grazing management.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:30):**  And we're seeing that resilience now to drought.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:33):**  So last year we had a major drought all through most of the West and to come here and still  
**[0:58:40-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:40):**  see you've got knee to thigh high, green grass, and the ranch is saying, this is not a drought  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:47):**  issue.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:48):**  This is a management issue.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:49):**  And to see that looking over the fence, people are buying in into that and they are the ones  
**[0:58:54-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:54):**  that will be directly remunerated.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:58:57):**  But sometimes there's a fear that I said like debt can be a real barrier.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:01):**  The banks, the accountants can be real barriers.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:04):**  Like I'm interested in how do we pull down some of those barriers that's reducing uptake.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:10):**  And so you could use community scale projects to look at what are the barriers to you to  
**[0:59:15-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:15):**  uptaking this and maybe it requires some financial investment.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:18):**  So the carbon project that started here, producers are being paid for their carbon, but they're  
**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:24):**  not doing it for the carbon.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:25):**  And you ask all of them, they're all talking about ecosystem services, downstream effects,  
**[0:59:29-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:29):**  biodiversity.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:30):**  You know, they're really brought into the whole thing, but that money enabled them to  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:36):**  put in more infrastructure to put in more water.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:40):**  And so we take away your fund, unfortunately, but you have magic power to change one thing,  
**[0:59:47-0:59:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:47):**  to change one thing overnight.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:48):**  And then I have a lot of people and say, yeah, I'm going to do two, which is sort of okay,  
**[0:59:52-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:52):**  but let's try to keep it to one.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:53):**  Like what would you change?  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=0:59:55):**  It could be global consciousness, could be get rid of subsidies, could be anything in  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:00):**  food and ag in this case, obviously, but also even outside that, like what would you do  
**[1:00:05-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:05):**  if you had literally a magic wand to change something overnight?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:09):**  Those things would be awesome.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:11):**  And I think teaching primary school children ecological principles to start some of this  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:19):**  thinking, creative thinking, to change the whole schooling system so that one plus one  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:25):**  doesn't equal two.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:27):**  You know, what is one plus one?  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:29):**  Well, if it's a buck goat and a nanny goat, that could be four.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:33):**  You know, like how do we start to create people that can think outside the box?  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:38):**  Because those are the ones that are going to really be able to deal with a world that  
**[1:00:42-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:42):**  we don't know what it's going to look like, you know, in our lifetime.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:46):**  The uncertainty is we want adaptive thinkers, right?  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:51):**  And I've asked this one already to Abby, but I don't really remember what you said, actually.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:00:56):**  You might have changed it three years down the line.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:00):**  If you could change one thing now with all the experience you have three years further,  
**[1:01:03-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:03):**  what would you change?  
**[1:01:04-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:04):**  What would you address or not address?  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:07):**  What would you use that that wand for?  
**[1:01:10-1:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:10):**  Yeah, it's interesting.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:12):**  I think it's very reflective maybe of just some of the more recent experiences I've had,  
**[1:01:17-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:17):**  but there is something about getting coaching or therapy or something for everyone.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:25):**  Because that feels like if people, it is so, there's so much healing that needs to be done.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:34):**  And that's both of the land, these degraded landscapes, but they're very reflective or  
**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:38):**  like, you know, how we are is so reflected in what we see all around us.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:44):**  And so it is very reflective of the healing that's needed for every one of us human beings  
**[1:01:50-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:50):**  on the planet.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:52):**  And so, yeah, what does that look like and how can that be part of what this journey  
**[1:01:57-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:57):**  is?  
**[1:01:58-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:01:58):**  And I do feel like, you know, as Nicole, you so often are always talking about mindset.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:04):**  It is like, it's what's in our heads.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:07):**  And if we can interact with that and heal, that would be an amazing place to start.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:15):**  If I can add, I was just at the conference on world affairs in Boulder, Colorado.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:21):**  Hundreds of people at that event, 120 speakers and speakers that are on, contributing to  
**[1:02:28-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:28):**  the IPCC report, people talking about justice and equity, really just big topics like what's  
**[1:02:35-1:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:35):**  going to happen with migration and food quality and indigenous rights.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:40):**  And what was absolutely fascinating is at the end of every single panel that I watched,  
**[1:02:45-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:45):**  when people were asked, what do we need to do?  
**[1:02:48-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:48):**  All of them said, connect with your heart.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:52):**  Do the work here first, because then we're in a position, we're not going to be the wounded  
**[1:02:56-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:56):**  healers trying to heal the world.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:02:58):**  We're not going to be those with anger and fear and rage inside of ourselves trying to  
**[1:03:02-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:02):**  create peace.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:04):**  And it was amazing to me that it was scientists saying this, it was activists saying it, it  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:08):**  was philosophers.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:10):**  Everybody had the same message.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:11):**  And I'm like, holy Toledo, this paradigm is shifting so fast.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:15):**  We have no idea.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:17):**  And that really is where the work needs to start is with ourselves and the people around  
**[1:03:22-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:22):**  us and certainly, you know, families and the whole piece.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:25):**  But that's the piece I'm most excited about.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:28):**  I don't think there's a better way to end this one.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:31):**  I have a lot of other questions, but I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:34):**  And I hope it's not the last time I have you both or individually on the podcast so we  
**[1:03:39-1:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:39):**  can dig deeper and deeper.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:41):**  And of course, following your amazing work.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:43):**  So I want to thank you so much for coming back, Abby, and for coming on the podcast  
**[1:03:47-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:47):**  for the first time, Nicole.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:03:48):**  Yes.

**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:04:39):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:04:41):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  
**[1:04:45-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:04:45):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:04:50):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:05:18-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:18):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[1:05:32-1:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:32):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:35):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:38):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[1:05:47-1:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:47):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:05:48-1:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:48):**  No.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:49):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:52):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:05:57):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:01):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:06:06-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:09):**  Thank you.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:10):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:18):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:20):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:25):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:06:30-1:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:30):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:06:35-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:35):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:37):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:06:41-1:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:41):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:45):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:50):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:06:51-1:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:51):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:53):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:06:56-1:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:56):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:06:59):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:07:01):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicole-masters-abby-rose#t=1:07:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

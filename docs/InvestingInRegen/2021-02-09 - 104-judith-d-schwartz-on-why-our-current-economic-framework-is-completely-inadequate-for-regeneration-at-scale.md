### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 17:00:00)
## 104 Judith D Schwartz on why our current economic framework is completely inadequate for regeneration at scale  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:13):**  Our landscapes are a reflection of our consciousness and wealth is functional ecosystems.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:18):**  Judith D. Swartz, writer of How Cows Save the Planet and Water in Plain Sight is back  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:23):**  on the show to discuss her latest book, The Reindeer Chronicles, where she dives deep  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:28):**  into regeneration at scale, very large scale.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:31):**  Looking at examples in Saudi Arabia, Norway, Spain, China and Mexico to document it's  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:36):**  absolutely possible to create abundant landscapes.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:40):**  So why are we not doing it everywhere?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:42):**  Maybe because many of us secretly don't believe or can't imagine that abundance is actually  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:47):**  possible.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:50):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:54):**  the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:00:55):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:00):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:05):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:10):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:12):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:16):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:18):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:23):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:27):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:32):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:35):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:39):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:55):**  Today we have back on the show Judith D. Swartz, the writer of Cow Save the Planet, Water in  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:01:59):**  Plain Sight and a very, very interesting new book, The Reindeer Chronicles.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:04):**  Welcome back, Judith.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:05):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:06):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:07):**  And to start with a question, obviously I will link to the interview we did in 2017,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:12):**  which seems six centuries ago now, which is still one of the most listened episodes we  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:16):**  ever did.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:17):**  I will link it below if you want to know more about those other two books.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:19):**  But as you covered regeneration so much there, what triggered you?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:23):**  What made you want to write another book about regeneration?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:25):**  But this time the scope was just, and the scale was way, way bigger.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:29):**  What triggered you to go back to that subject, but take another look at it?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:33):**  Wow.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:34):**  That's such a funny question as if I have a choice.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:36):**  You could write about anything else.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:38):**  No, right.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:39):**  Well, as a journalist, well, it's what is compelling and the material and the developments  
**[0:02:45-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:45):**  around us and the need for a new story and for understanding where we are just so important.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:54):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:02:55):**  A few things that compelled me to continue in this vein.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:00):**  One was what I felt was a disconnect between all of the news out there about the environment  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:07):**  that is relentlessly and aggressively negative.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:14):**  And that didn't quite square with what I was seeing out in the world.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:20):**  I mean, of course I was seeing a lot of problems, a lot of crises, a lot of very alarming ecological  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:26):**  developments, but I was also seeing incredible work that wasn't being highlighted in the  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:34):**  general public conversation.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:37):**  So that was one thing.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:39):**  And then the other thing was the conversation about climate.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:44):**  What has been screaming to me is the opportunities that we have just kind of left dormant.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:03:53):**  And the main thing is that so far in our conversations about climate, we have neglected the role  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:02):**  of functioning, healthy ecosystems in climate regulation.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:07):**  And why is that?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:08):**  What's the root cause there?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:09):**  We had Walter Yen on the show and I don't know if it's out yet when this will be out.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:13):**  That depends a bit on the schedule, but it's purely CO2.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:18):**  And he discussed that as well.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:20):**  Why is that we're not looking at functioning ecosystems in terms of problems and solutions?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:26):**  Well, Walter, of course, is someone who I've learned an incredible amount from and he's  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:31):**  someone that has really brought to the fore the role of the water cycle in climate.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:37):**  I mean, I'll give your listeners some coming attractions that really what drives climate  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:44):**  is water-based processes.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:48):**  Now taking that a step further is what drives those water processes.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:54):**  And that is life.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:04:57):**  That is the activities and the behaviors of plants, animals, fungi, all of the living  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:06):**  systems.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:08):**  And particularly, I remember when I finished my book about water, what I was left with,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:14):**  which was not what I expected at all, was the sense that plants drive the show.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:20):**  I remember that.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:22):**  I remember we talked about de-vegetation, I think, in the first interview and plants  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:25):**  drive the show.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:26):**  But I'm feeling that there's going to be a follow up on that.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:29):**  So what do you currently see as driving the show?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:32):**  Well, we were talking about why the discussion around climate has stayed so CO2 focused.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:41):**  For this new book, for the Reindeer Chronicles, I spent some time in Spain with a scientist,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:48):**  my goodness, he's a meteorologist, climatologist, an atmospheric physicist named Mian Mian.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:05:56):**  And it's really interesting to talk to people who have been around this realm for a while.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:03):**  So he's in his mid 70s.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:05):**  And he remembers in the 1970s, there was a line of inquiry about changing ecosystems  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:14):**  and the effect on climate, basically changes in land use and climate.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:21):**  In the 70s?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:22):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:23):**  What was really interesting.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:25):**  He directed me to some publications that I'm trying to remember, like, you know, manmade  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:32):**  impacts on climate or inadvertent human impacts on climate.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:37):**  And what was particularly interesting to me is that these publications actually developed  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:43):**  out of a meeting that took place a half an hour away from me at Williams College in Massachusetts  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:49):**  in the US.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:50):**  So Mian was kind of aware of how this conversation just sort of stalled.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:06:59):**  And as he put it, in his cynical way, is that carbon is something that you can talk about  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:05):**  endlessly and never do anything about.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:08):**  But once you bring land into the conversation, then you're dealing with issues like development,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:18):**  purchasing of land, taking marshland and turning it into hotels and bringing highways in and  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:25):**  trade and where people want to live.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:28):**  So it gets much more messy politically.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:32):**  You wouldn't think so because our conversations about carbon have been contentious enough.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:38):**  But when you're in a situation where scientists are saying, no, you can't use that land the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:46):**  way you want to, then that gets very, very intricate and contentious.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:54):**  So land use has been deliberately left out of the conversation because it gets sensitive  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:07:59):**  very, very quickly.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:01):**  And CO2, nobody sees it, nobody smells it.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:04):**  It's already politicized a lot, but way less difficult to handle.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:08):**  Right.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:09):**  So it's partly that, and then it's also that carbon is easier to measure.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:16):**  So when you're looking at water processes, I mean, water is always on the move.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:23):**  It's changing form.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:24):**  You've got water vapor that's invisibly moving across the continent as we talked about being  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:32):**  driven by plants transpiring and the condensation process pulling the moisture down.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:39):**  All these really, really complex and hard to pin down processes.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:47):**  So one of the things that's interesting about Mian's work is that he has been able to directly  
**[0:08:54-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:08:54):**  connect land use changes with a very specific climate development, which is the loss of  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:04):**  the regular summer rains in the Western Mediterranean.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:08):**  So that was really, really interesting.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:11):**  And I was able to have a journey through this region, going up into the hills across the  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:18):**  continental divide above Valencia in Spain.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:23):**  And he would watch the clouds and tell us, tell me and my husband, because we were together,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:30):**  when it's going to rain.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:32):**  And it was uncanny, his accuracy.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:34):**  Can you explain that?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:36):**  Like what's, I mean, I obviously read the book and I think it's one of the first times  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:41):**  you see that so specific, that connection.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:43):**  We've known it.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:44):**  We've heard it before.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:45):**  I mean, indigenous tribes have mentioned forever, I think with this myth in Indonesia has shown  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:51):**  you can create clouds and you can stay, but it's always been a bit unconnected.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:55):**  Like it's the clouds are there and they're not really connected to what we do here on  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:09:59):**  the land.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:00):**  And in this case, you show very, very clearly that connection is there, which means that  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:06):**  whatever we do here influences whatever happens over above us and beyond us as well, especially  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:12):**  in terms of rain, which obviously for agriculture and land use is absolutely crucial.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:17):**  Not too much, not too little, not too often, not in one shot, but there is a very hopeful  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:21):**  message there as well.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:22):**  But can you explain a bit those summer rains in the Western Mediterranean?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:27):**  What has gone wrong there?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:28):**  What has changed there?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:29):**  And so what are also the opportunities to, I'm not saying change it back, but to have  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:32):**  a positive impact there?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:35):**  So over several decades, it was observed that the summer rains were failing.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:40):**  So in the past, near the Mediterranean and inland, every day in the summer, the ground  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:48):**  would heat up, it would become hot and sunny.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:52):**  And then in the afternoon, the clouds would come in and then you'd get a rainfall fairly  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:10:57):**  brief and it would cleanse the air.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:00):**  It would provide rain for farming and the farmers would depend on this rain.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:07):**  So this was the system that people had gotten used to.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:10):**  And then that started to change around, or maybe it was noticed.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:15):**  I think it always starts to change before we notice it, but it was about the 1980s,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:20):**  1990s that it was noticed.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:22):**  And Mian was asked to study this, which he did for a long time.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:26):**  And one other thing about Mian's work is that he has been involved for many decades in developing  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:33):**  different technologies.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:35):**  So for example, he actually invented that machine you walk through that detects metal  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:43):**  at the airport.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:44):**  This was long ago that he did this.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:47):**  He also invented COSPEC.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:49):**  I forget what that stands for, but that is what volcano specialists study to be able  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:11:58):**  to predict when tremors will occur.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:02):**  So he was measuring plumes of industrial pollution.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:06):**  He's been measuring this for a long time.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:08):**  And the reason I point this out is that what he says is that with many reports, scientists  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:16):**  are using models and models are not the same as precise observation and documenting that  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:24):**  observation.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:25):**  Which many farmers would tell you the same that are transitioning to regenerative.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:29):**  It's a very similar point.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:31):**  Like, yeah, but we see something else here and we're observing and reacting to that,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:35):**  although the model tells us something else.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:37):**  Right, right.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:38):**  Not that models aren't useful at all, but it's important to understand that often the  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:43):**  slight differences are averaged out.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:45):**  So anyway, so what he did was he measured the movement of moisture.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:12:51):**  And what he found is that over these decades, when the land was developed, when trees were  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:00):**  cut down, when housing developments went up because these were very desirable areas along  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:07):**  the coast, very beautiful, when marshes were drained for agriculture.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:15):**  So basically there was less plant activity.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:20):**  There was less transpiration.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:22):**  And what he determined was that the moisture rising from the Mediterranean Sea and moving  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:30):**  along the breeze inland, that was never a high enough concentration of moisture to generate  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:38):**  a rainfall.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:39):**  So needed the life on the ground to also be fed.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:42):**  Exactly, was picking up that moisture as the breeze went over the land.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:50):**  And that was enough juice that was a high enough concentration of moisture.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:57):**  To make it rain further.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:13:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:00):**  So the beauty of this is that-  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:03):**  We know what to do about that.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:04):**  Yeah, that's the beauty.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:06):**  I was saying exactly that.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:08):**  So what Mian makes clear is that we can't just put trees in X location and be assured  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:16):**  that we're going to get rain in Y location, but rather in that region, we can help to  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:24):**  reinstate rainfall.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:26):**  The way he puts it is that it may be 70 kilometers downwind or something.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:32):**  And he said, that's of course another challenge.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:34):**  It begs the question, how many trees, what kind of trees or how much life or vegetation  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:40):**  and where exactly?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:41):**  But that's a question to find out and to figure out.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:45):**  But it's a very optimistic question instead of a very, oh, the climate changed and it  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:50):**  stopped raining answer, which sort of finishes the discussion there.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:54):**  Right, right.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:55):**  This actually makes me think of something I haven't thought of in a while.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:14:58):**  I think at different points we've talked about the biotic pump theory.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:02):**  The Russian scientists, Anastasia Makareva, and something that she, I can't remember if  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:09):**  she said this to me or she wrote that at some point she believes that there will be a field  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:14):**  of kind of healing of forests.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:18):**  So it's kind of like medicine for the earth, like a study of where and what kind of trees  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:24):**  might we plant to be able to have the impact that would benefit the larger ecosystem.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:31):**  I don't think we're that far off.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:33):**  I have had those discussions quite a lot the last years.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:38):**  I'm going to say plural, but honestly, mostly the last year.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:41):**  What scale in terms of landscape regeneration, what do you need, what to plant where and  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:46):**  why, what is the technology we need to even start answering that question?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:50):**  What is the indigenous knowledge we need to start answering those questions?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:53):**  Because a tree is not a tree and a tree in a different place or a very nice cover crop  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:15:58):**  field is fundamentally different where it is and how it's composted, which makes it  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:03):**  very, very, very difficult and very context specific, but also very, very interesting  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:07):**  because it depends.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:08):**  It really depends where you're at, but it's super optimistic and very interesting and  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:13):**  very closely to water in plain sight.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:16):**  It was literally in plain sight, but like in a cloud above the terrain.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:21):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:22):**  So that triggered the book to a certain extent.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:26):**  But in the book you cover in general these large, very ambitious, some would call probably  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:32):**  crazy projects that to bring back the reins of the Western Mediterranean and some others.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:37):**  What's the most ambitious or craziest example you want to give out of the book if it's not  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:42):**  this one you just mentioned?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:43):**  And I say crazy in the most lovable way possible because I definitely think we need more crazy  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:49):**  people.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:50):**  Yes, of course.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:51):**  Well, one of the craziest ones is the restoration of the Los Plateau.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:16:56):**  And I don't know whether you've addressed that on this show.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:00):**  It has come up a few times.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:01):**  Yeah, but it's always good to repeat because I think it's such an extraordinary.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:04):**  I will also link the video of John Liu below in the show notes if you're interested.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:08):**  But please, for anybody that is thinking, I heard about it, but I don't really know what  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:13):**  is the Los Plateau and what happened there.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:14):**  Right.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:15):**  So that was another inspiration for this book is that I could not believe that most people  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:20):**  have not heard about this because it's such an extraordinary story that shows the incredible  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:27):**  potential to restore large scale damaged ecosystems.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:31):**  So the story here is that the Los Plateau is a large area in China, and this is where  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:39):**  agriculture was born in China around 10,000 years ago, about the same time period as agriculture  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:46):**  emerged in the Fertile Crescent.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:50):**  So this was the breadbasket of China.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:17:53):**  This was the home of many important global civilizations and all of this.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:05):**  And over time, following a pattern that is common where ecosystems start to decline,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:14):**  the ecosystem started to decline, and this area is marked by a particular kind of soil,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:21):**  low soil, which is high mineral, but very friable, very dusty.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:26):**  So when the land started to erode, it went into the Yellow River and silted up the Yellow  
**[0:18:33-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:33):**  River and that caused all kinds of problems, big deadly floods and inability for navigation,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:42):**  all of these different problems.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:43):**  And in the meantime, as we moved through the 20th century, the land was so degraded that  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:50):**  the millions of people who lived there were struggling to survive.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:18:55):**  So this was an area that was a real, real trouble spot for China.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:02):**  So the Chinese government realized that they could continually try to patch up this problem,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:10):**  or maybe they could step back and see how to restore the ecology of the region.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:18):**  So they gathered together hydrologists, geologists, biologists, economists, and all different  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:25):**  kinds of experts, and they spent years developing plans.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:29):**  And this was in collaboration with the World Bank and an incredibly ambitious task.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:36):**  And what they did was employ some fairly simple practices, but over a large expanse.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:46):**  They hired villagers to do the work of building terraces, because by terracing the hills,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:56):**  the water would slow down.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:19:57):**  It wouldn't just rush off and carry all those nutrients, the topsoil, all that dust down  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:03):**  into the river plain.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:05):**  So they did terracing, they did planting, and they penned the animals because the livestock,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:15):**  the sheep and the goats were being allowed to wander freely and graze at will.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:22):**  So you had a situation where there might be a few scraggly plants on a hillside.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:28):**  Trying to survive.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:30):**  Right.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:31):**  And the animals would be eating them, and so no matter what the people did, the animals  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:36):**  were eating the saplings and all of that and accentuating the ecological damage.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:43):**  So they penned the animals, which in holistic management terms would mean giving the land  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:49):**  a chance to recover.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:51):**  So that's what they did.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:20:55):**  And over 10 to 14 years, the land was transformed.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:02):**  So I really encourage your listeners to have a look at some of John Lu's videos, because  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:07):**  I mean, one that I refer to in the book is four seconds.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:11):**  It's time-lapsed photography where you watch 14 years of change in four seconds and you  
**[0:21:20-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:20):**  watch this landscape go from dry and lifeless to bursting with green and vegetation.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:29):**  Yeah, the before and after is spectacular.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:32):**  You don't see many before and afters like that, I think.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:36):**  And of course it continued.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:37):**  And looking at these gigantic projects or like the landscape regeneration and landscape  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:43):**  restoration seems absolutely and is absolutely possible.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:47):**  What is needed to do it in a thousand landscapes like WWF is saying, or what is missing now  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:53):**  to really get, let's say, to the impact?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:56):**  We need to do it on a lot more landscapes.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:21:57):**  What have you seen with your travels and your research that is clearly missing?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:01):**  Because the tech or the approaches seem to be there and the examples are there, but somehow  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:07):**  we're not all having this discussion.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:08):**  Like how can we regenerate the landscape?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:10):**  I mean now, or how can we, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:12):**  So what's missing?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:13):**  What do you think?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:14):**  Okay.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:15):**  So two basic things are missing.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:17):**  One is that people know that this is even possible because most people don't.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:24):**  You do because you've been having these conversations.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:27):**  But if we read the news, the nature of news seems to be that it's reactive.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:34):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:35):**  That when something is a problem, it's news.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:38):**  And not that that's wrong, but since the news media frames our understanding of the world,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:47):**  the fact that the possibility is missing in the news means that people don't know it's  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:52):**  possible.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:53):**  So one, and the stories that we tell about the environment, I think that people tend  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:22:58):**  to have a sense that landscapes are static unless they decline.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:04):**  They're stuck.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:06):**  They've always been there like that, or they go down.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:07):**  Yeah, that's a good point.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:08):**  We never think that it could be full of life.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:12):**  Right.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:13):**  So that's one reason.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:14):**  And then the other is our larger economic framework.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:20):**  So here we are.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:22):**  We know there's work to be done.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:24):**  We're talking about restoring landscapes, restoring ecosystems.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:28):**  We know that it's possible.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:30):**  We know that there is therefore this huge amount of work to be done.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:36):**  It's hard work sometimes, but it's also joyful work because what can be more rewarding than  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:45):**  watching land heal?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:48):**  We are land-based creatures.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:50):**  We evolved in ecosystems.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:52):**  We evolved in relation to our landscape.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:23:56):**  So there is a part of us that just hums to this kind of work.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:01):**  Have you seen that as well?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:03):**  Like the people you met, you talked to, you interviewed, you spent a lot of time with,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:08):**  do they seem to hum?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:11):**  That's an interesting question.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:12):**  I don't think I've ever asked that before, but in this case it seems appropriate.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:17):**  I don't know.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:18):**  That's kind of a, I hum when I garden.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:20):**  Or do they seem to, like what you described where, this is a different question.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:25):**  Are we made to regenerate?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:26):**  And do you see that when you meet people that are actively doing that today, like seem to  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:32):**  fit or seem to be in the flow?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:34):**  I see absolute joy.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:37):**  I see optimism.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:39):**  I see connection.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:43):**  Sometimes we think what we're looking for is happiness, but what we're really looking  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:46):**  for is a connected engagement with what we're doing.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:24:53):**  I think there's, we as humans have a drive to learn and to grow.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:00):**  And I think that for a lot of people, when you learn about, so I'm thinking, mentally  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:06):**  I'm referring back, I took a permaculture design course myself and it was a very joyful  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:12):**  experience and it was during the pandemic.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:15):**  So what we were able to do was have one day on site, social distanced and masked, and  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:22):**  then two days on Zoom.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:23):**  But that in-person piece was just enough to get a sense of what each of us is experiencing.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:34):**  And so there was learning, but there was also a sense of relearning because as I just said  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:42):**  before, and I don't know how else to put it, we are made for our landscapes.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:46):**  We are designed to be in relation to our landscapes.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:52):**  And during the pandemic, many people, people who are fortunate enough to have access to  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:25:57):**  nature experienced that and felt a shift in themselves.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:03):**  I think we're at a very, I mean, obviously if you had access to that, you really, really  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:09):**  appreciate it.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:10):**  The garden, the park, if you were able to go, the roof garden, the balcony with some  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:16):**  life on it, but it's something we've never looked at so much because we always had the  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:19):**  chance to go somewhere.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:21):**  And obviously, I mean, the farmers, I know many of the farmers I know said, yeah, nothing  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:24):**  really changed because of the farm.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:27):**  I mean, distancing is relatively easy.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:29):**  Our work continued as we are an essential job.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:32):**  Obviously sales, et cetera, completely shifted.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:34):**  But being outside and being in landscapes, we hopefully appreciate a lot more this year  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:40):**  and being in vast landscapes obviously helps.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:42):**  Right.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:43):**  Our economic system does not create the opportunity for people to heal landscapes, at least at  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:51):**  this moment.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:26:52):**  That's a huge, huge disconnect that there's work to be done, people who are underemployed  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:00):**  and unemployed, and yet we can't seem to bring that together.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:05):**  There's more money in the world than ever before, and yet we don't seem to bring that  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:09):**  together.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:10):**  Right.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:11):**  So I think what's interesting about the work of young people, what this pandemic period  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:14):**  is doing to them is sort of telling them that their efforts don't matter because there's  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:21):**  no work for them.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:22):**  But yet there's all this work that needs to be done.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:25):**  So I know that you've spoken to people at Common Land, and in this book, I did visit  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:31):**  the Spanish Altiplano project in Common Land.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:35):**  And I bring that up because what Common Land recognized is that there are places that are  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:42):**  suffering from the lack of people.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:44):**  And so creating the opportunity economically for people to have viable work in those places.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:27:53):**  I know colleagues that are doing that similar work in the United States, in Kansas, for  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:00):**  example, which is suffering, I drove around Kansas after a conference after Gale Fuller's  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:06):**  field school in Kansas.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:08):**  And we were going through town after town that had nothing.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:13):**  Oh, you're the same in Europe, many inland places.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:17):**  And if you describe Spain, Italy, France, like the depopulation of the countryside,  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:23):**  Eastern Europe has been happening for a long time.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:27):**  And it's, let's say, not very helpful for regeneration because you need people on the  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:31):**  land, you need people observing, you need hands, you need a lot of life to create life.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:36):**  And if there's only one guy or girl, mostly a guy with a tractor, that's doing I don't  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:41):**  know, many thousands acres, just not going to work.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:44):**  And that's, yeah, we need life too.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:46):**  But hopefully with this year or the year just past, we start to appreciate the city for  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:52):**  what it is, but also the countryside and hopefully, obviously not the super dry, very depressing  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:28:58):**  and very empty lifeless countryside, but start to see like, there's something we can create  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:03):**  there and there's good life there.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:04):**  And if it is dry and lifeless, we can create something there.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:09):**  We know that's possible.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:10):**  So I'll mention another amazing story from the book, because, I mean, one of the things  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:17):**  that does make me feel really hopeful is that some of the most dramatic examples of ecological  
**[0:29:24-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:24):**  restoration occur in some of the most extreme situations where you would have to be crazy  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:33):**  to think that you could create a functioning ecosystem in this landscape.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:37):**  So I'm thinking about Neil Spackman's work in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:43):**  So Neil is an American and he happened to study the Arabic language in university.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:29:52):**  So he had that skill and someone was looking for someone to manage a project working with  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:03):**  the Bedouin in Saudi Arabia in a particular place.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:07):**  Now the Bedouin, of course, are people who have always moved around with their animals,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:15):**  but the land had become so degraded that they were now living in cinder blocks and living  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:21):**  in dire poverty.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:24):**  So Neil took the job and said that he would like to add an ecological component.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:33):**  So he did a kind of fast track permaculture study with Jeff Lawton in Jordan and Lawton  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:42):**  came up to Saudi Arabia and they picked a site.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:45):**  So Neil had a team of the local people there and this is a place where it may go a few  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:54):**  years without rain and it gets really, really hot.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:30:59):**  So hot that often they only do their work at night.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:03):**  So the goal was to create a functioning ecosystem and to do so, you need to have water, but  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:11):**  water doesn't always arrive.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:15):**  Actually I think, so this was the epitome of desert, but what's really interesting  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:19):**  to me is how Neil defines a desert.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:23):**  You know that we kind of think we know what a desert is?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:25):**  A lot of sand, yeah.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:27):**  We think that there's some sort of threshold of if there's more than this amount of rain,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:32):**  it's not a desert.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:33):**  If there's less, it is a desert.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:35):**  Neil says that a desert is a place where when it rains, it floods because when it rains  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:44):**  and it doesn't flood, that means that the land is able to hold onto that rain and then  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:48):**  by definition, it is no longer desert.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:51):**  So in short, I'm leaping ahead, but that's what he was able to create.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:31:55):**  So what they did was they built a variety of water harvesting little components and  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:01):**  they put in swales of the water, would stay on the landscape, little earthen dams and  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:08):**  then when it rained, the water would be held and then they could start to plant.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:14):**  So they planted out from where they were able to hold the rain and they were able to plant  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:21):**  trees and they planted grasses and the trees grew and then here's where the story gets  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:28):**  really amazing.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:30):**  In 2016, the project ran out of funding so they could no longer do the irrigation.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:37):**  They turned the irrigation system off.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:39):**  Now when they were irrigating, it was only from the water that they captured and held.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:43):**  They did not go into fossil water because as Neil says, you need to stay within your  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:48):**  water budget and the rain created their water budget.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:52):**  I love that piece of the book.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:53):**  Like the water budget discussion is absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:32:57):**  So they turned off the irrigation and then two years later, Neil went and visited again  
**[0:33:05-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:05):**  and 80% of those trees survived without irrigation because through holding onto the water, which  
**[0:33:15-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:15):**  allowed the conditions for the soil to stay moist, for the microbial life to survive,  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:23):**  for the trees to get established so that they were able to create their fungal networks,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:29):**  which would extend their ability to reach further away for moisture.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:35):**  Those systems were created and were robust enough that the trees survived.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:40):**  And did the rain come at some point?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:43):**  Like did it, since 2016, did the water harvesting, swales, et cetera, were tested again?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:51):**  So during that time, I think there was about a two year period that they didn't get any  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:33:56):**  rain, but then when they did get water, it was held in the landscape.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:02):**  So the other thing is of course that moisture creates more moisture.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:09):**  So when you have the trees that are established, those trees are creating moisture through  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:15):**  the transpiration, through the small water cycle.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:18):**  So you're creating the conditions for more life and for more circulating moisture.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:25):**  I think I've seen a video about this project.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:27):**  I'll try to find it and put it in the show notes.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:30):**  But looking at all of these projects, what would you like investors to take away from  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:38):**  it?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:39):**  What would you like if they read the book, if they listen to this, if they see other  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:42):**  interviews with you, if they see these amazing examples, what would you hope that the main  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:46):**  message is that investors that are investing their own money or other people's money that  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:51):**  are managing capital take away from the reindeer chronicles?  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:34:56):**  That wealth is in functioning ecosystems, wealth and resilience, climate resilience,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:05):**  amidst weather extremes, social resilience, that we can bring resilience back to our communities.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:15):**  And that landscapes that we think of as wastelands are opportunities because they are.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:25):**  And then flipping the question, what if you wake up tomorrow morning and you turned into  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:30):**  an investor and you manage a crazy amount of money, let's say a billion, a billion dollars,  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:36):**  and you have complete freedom to invest it in whatever you feel has most impact or whatever  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:41):**  you feel fits best.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:43):**  It's not a grant facility, so it has to come back at some point.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:47):**  But it could be a very, very, very long time.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:48):**  It could be without any return.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:49):**  It could be just a principle.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:51):**  But if you would be managing a billion dollar investment fund, what would you focus on?  
**[0:35:56-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:35:56):**  I would look for where these disconnects are and try to address them.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:04):**  So for example, work that needs to be done, connecting that with people who need work,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:11):**  because these are opportunities just waiting to happen.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:16):**  And we know that's possible.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:17):**  We know, for example, during the New Deal in the United States that unemployed people  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:24):**  were given work opportunities.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:27):**  And some of those work opportunities were not merely creating projects, but regenerating  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:35):**  culture.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:36):**  So the cultural piece is so important.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:40):**  And that is one of the things that I was most impressed with about Common Land's programs  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:45):**  with the four returns.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:47):**  So usually in business, we're trained to look at one return as if life were of one dimension,  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:57):**  and that's the financial return.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:36:59):**  So looking at the return of nature and ecosystem function, that is huge and essential.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:08):**  And then the return of social capital, of the revival of communities, that's huge.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:16):**  The extra piece that Common Land has focused on is the return of inspiration, which I see  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:24):**  really connected to, well, connected to all of it actually, but very connected to the  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:28):**  social capital.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:29):**  I mean, how many people all over the world just feel that their communities have been  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:37):**  left behind?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:38):**  I mean, that's a backstory.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:39):**  I don't want to get into US politics, but it's one of the backstories of US politics  
**[0:37:45-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:45):**  right now, and I also can say that with some understanding, living in a rural area myself.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:53):**  In many cases, it has been left behind.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:37:56):**  In the news, in everything in culture and politics has been focused on cities, and only  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:03):**  the big ones even.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:04):**  And the rest is sort of considered, yeah, once every four years or five years when you  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:08):**  need to vote and suddenly it becomes important, and in between it doesn't.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:12):**  Which of course, if you look at climate, if you look at food, if you look at ecosystem  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:16):**  services, it's not happening in the cities, it's happening out there.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:20):**  Right.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:21):**  And those are all opportunities.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:23):**  And you know, when I think of here in Southwestern Vermont, people feeling disconnected from  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:29):**  the landscape and feeling that the landscape can't provide for us, that life is elsewhere,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:35):**  you know, that's tragic and it wouldn't take much.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:39):**  So what would you do then?  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:40):**  Let's say you would be limiting yourself to investing where you're based and doing a place-based  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:47):**  focus.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:48):**  What would you focus on in your area if you had that fund upon you?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:52):**  Okay, well, I'm smiling partly because a colleague of mine is actually doing something like that,  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:38:57):**  creating a regenerative food network here.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:01):**  It will be around New England, but based in Southwestern Vermont, because that's where  
**[0:39:06-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:06):**  he is.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:07):**  This is Jesse McDougall of Studio Hill Farm.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:10):**  They've already bought a meat processing facility, which will mean that farmers no longer have  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:16):**  to travel several states away to get USDA approved.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:21):**  Approved, slaughtered.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:23):**  Exactly.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:24):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:25):**  So what would I do?  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:26):**  We are so wealthy here in terms of land and the potential of our land and the biodiversity  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:34):**  of our land.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:35):**  So I would just help people rally around our landscapes and start food programs, permaculture  
**[0:39:50-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:39:50):**  sites and food forests and creating the opportunities for people to celebrate what we have rather  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:00):**  than focusing and lamenting what we lack.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:04):**  There's a lot that we lack right now.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:06):**  This is an area where several colleges have closed in the last few years.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:13):**  And so those colleges could be centers for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:19):**  So you would focus on seeding a lot, planting a lot of different seeds and see what comes  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:24):**  up, which is a very regenerative agriculture approach to seeing what emerges.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:31):**  And then also, and this is something that came up again and again with the people that  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:35):**  I interviewed in this book, the focus on abundance rather than scarcity.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:40):**  Can you go into that a bit?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:42):**  Because I had a lot of those conversations actually the past week, somehow it constantly  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:47):**  was about abundance versus scarcity.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:50):**  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:51):**  It's a worldview and a lot of indigenous cultures focused on abundance rather than scarcity.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:40:59):**  So I don't know whether many of your listeners have read the book Braiding Sweetgrass by  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:04):**  Robin Wall Kimmerer.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:06):**  Throughout the book are examples of the abundance mindset.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:11):**  So when you give, you're creating a relationship with who you're giving to, you're creating  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:19):**  a relationship with, let's say she opens the book with strawberries.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:24):**  So you're giving to the strawberries through your appreciation.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:29):**  And if you're just dividing out, like, well, I need to save this and not give any away  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:36):**  with a scarcity mindset, you're actually depriving yourself of the opportunities to give and  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:42):**  to share, and that diminishes your experience.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:47):**  So what's interesting now is we are seeing a kind of like end point of the scarcity mentality  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:58):**  in all the hoarding.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:41:59):**  So in the United States, we're seeing billionaires, like their wealth is growing dramatically,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:08):**  even as the ordinary person is struggling more and more by the month.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:16):**  So this is sort of what I see as the end point of the scarcity mindset.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:22):**  I need to keep accumulating because this is scarce.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:27):**  Wealth is scarce.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:28):**  And if I don't build my wealth, someone else will.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:32):**  Yeah, it's a zero sum game mindset.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:36):**  But I think it comes back from another point you made before that we see landscapes degraded  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:43):**  or stuck, but not the potential that it could be full of life.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:46):**  We see a lot of things like to see the abundance, you also need to see the possibility of regeneration,  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:52):**  specifically in food, but also in wealth.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:53):**  If you see an incredibly degraded landscape, you almost automatically start hoarding water  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:42:59):**  and fuel and food because if you cannot see the potential of that landscape, and what  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:05):**  you see in the book is the potential of those landscapes is actually way more than we could  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:08):**  ever imagine, and actually relatively fast as well, which sort of automatically gets  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:13):**  you to like, wow, actually, you can grow way more than we ever imagined.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:17):**  Like the growing of food is not the issue.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:19):**  It's the distribution.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:20):**  And it's potentially not even the money is the issue, but it's a distribution.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:23):**  But it's a very tricky mindset because it's very, I wouldn't say natural, but very easy  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:27):**  to go back into the scarcity.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:29):**  Like I need to take this because there's not enough or there won't be enough.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:33):**  That's how we're trained.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:34):**  And what I'm learning more and more is that not all cultures began that way.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:41):**  And the scarcity mindset has, I guess we could say, served us in that fear or that competitiveness  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:51):**  has led to advances.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:54):**  But I think we can broaden things out and ask, is it serving us now?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:43:59):**  There would be competitive in abundance and see in terms of creating life instead of hoarding  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:04):**  billions.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:05):**  That would be very interesting.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:07):**  Right.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:08):**  Sometimes I thought that if biodiversity was a status symbol, creating biodiversity, so  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:15):**  let's say wealthy people on their estates or whatever, that it would be seen as cool  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:20):**  rather than having the biggest house or the fanciest car to have the most life naturally  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:27):**  emerging.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:28):**  Would that prompt a shift?  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:29):**  I don't know.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:30):**  I'm thinking of a scarcity mindset there too of status.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:35):**  But just wondering, just thinking about the drivers of people's behavior and wondering  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:39):**  if that would make a difference.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:41):**  But yeah, to the point of when you see a degraded landscape, one automatically thinks about  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:47):**  scarcity and hoarding and keeping what I have and making sure that there's enough that what  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:53):**  John Liu, and just to clarify, we've mentioned John Liu that he documented in film the restoration  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:44:59):**  of the Los Plateau.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:00):**  And that's what allowed us to see in such fabulous detail how this project succeeded.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:07):**  Which is something that doesn't happen often.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:09):**  Like a lot of these projects, you never see that before or the jury.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:13):**  Like it's very rare that somebody in this case, luckily he was I think hired by the  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:17):**  World Bank or something, but luckily there was somebody there that is a great documentary  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:21):**  maker that actually documented this.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:24):**  Otherwise your four seconds of time lapse wouldn't have been there.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:26):**  Would have been one second at the end, but would be way less powerful.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:29):**  Right.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:30):**  No, that is so important and it's so fortunate.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:33):**  What he says, our landscapes are a reflection of our consciousness, which I think is a really  
**[0:45:40-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:40):**  powerful understanding.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:42):**  And so when you have a degraded landscape, we can't help but feel a sense of scarcity,  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:51):**  of lack.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:45:53):**  Whereas if we're in a flourishing landscape, we're more likely to feel a sense of peace,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:00):**  a sense of balance, a sense of connection with our surroundings and vice versa.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:07):**  So if our consciousness is organized around what will I have, what can I gain, how can  
**[0:46:16-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:16):**  I compete as opposed to how can I share, who might I cooperate with, what can I be in relationship  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:25):**  to, that might generate something different.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:29):**  Anyway, it's just an interesting thing to think about.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:32):**  I think it's a very, very powerful message to end this conversation.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:36):**  I want to thank you so much for writing the books you do, the research you do, the storytelling  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:41):**  you do because it's fundamental.

**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:46:53):**  I don't think so either.

**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:15):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:19):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:23):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:25):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:29):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:34):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:39):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:41):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:57):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:48:59):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:02):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:07):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food

**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:16):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:19):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:22):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:26):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:31):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:32):**  No.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:33):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:36):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:41):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:45):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:50):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:54):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:49:55-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:49:55):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:02):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:04):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:14):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:19):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:20):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:25):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:29):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:35):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:37):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:39):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:45):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/judith-d-schwartz-2/#t=0:50:50):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

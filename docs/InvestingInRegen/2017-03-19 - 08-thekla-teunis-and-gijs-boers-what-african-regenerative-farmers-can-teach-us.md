## 08 Thekla Teunis and Gijs Boers, what African regenerative farmers can teach us  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:10):**  or in the links below. Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:13):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Tekla Teunis and Gijsboers of Grounded.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:17):**  We're going to talk about the challenges you face when you work with large groups of farmers,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:22):**  but also the enormous opportunities this brings. And how to work with business cases that come out  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:27):**  of the work with farmers instead of very strict 10-year planning. The huge opportunities that you  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:33):**  have at the moment in local processing in Africa and what these opportunities mean for impact  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:38):**  investors. It really means that you'll be able to pay farmers for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:45):**  Doing this, it's essential to find the right local crop mix. And to find this mix, you need to listen  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:51):**  to farmers. They know what could work well on their land, even if they're not growing that at  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:00:56):**  the moment because they are in a much more short-term mindset. If you get them to think  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:02):**  long-term and you get them the incentives to do that, you will lock a huge opportunity locally  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:07):**  to introduce and maintain regenerative agriculture. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:13):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture. Investing as if the  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:18):**  planet mattered. Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:23):**  space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities,  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:29):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return. Why am I focused on soil and  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:35):**  regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:39):**  treat our land, grow our food, and what we eat. And it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:44):**  and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:50):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:01:55):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month. But at the same time I would love to take  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:00):**  this further, share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:04):**  regenerative food and agriculture. More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:09):**  series. So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:15):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to support me  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:20):**  and make this happen. For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the  
**[0:02:25-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:25):**  description below. And now without further ado, the interview. Enjoy! Welcome to investing in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:33):**  regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered. I'm Koen van Zijen, the host of  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:38):**  today. In the podcast today I'm talking to Tecla Teunis and Gijs Boers, co-founders of Grounded.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:43):**  An organization working with large groups of farmers in southern Africa to develop business  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:47):**  cases to bring agriculture back into balance. And of course we're going to ask what balance means.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:02:53):**  Welcome Tecla and Gijs. Yeah thank you Koen. Thanks Koen. So to dive in with it immediately,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:00):**  why are you doing what you're doing? Yeah I guess that's probably a personal story for both of us.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:06):**  For me, I have been working in corporate strategy for a couple of years and at some point I went on  
**[0:03:15-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:15):**  a cycling trip in Asia. So I cycled through China and Laos and Vietnam. And if you're on your bicycle,  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:24):**  most of the time you're cycling either through nature or through agricultural land. And it  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:29):**  struck me to see that a lot of these agricultural systems that I've been involved in, they're  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:35):**  systems that I saw even though I didn't know much about agriculture, seem to be either really  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:41):**  extractive, so not very sustainable in the long run, or underperforming. So it seemed like they  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:48):**  could actually up their production quite a bit in the case of a lot of smallholder farmers. So then  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:54):**  I actually couldn't sleep for a couple of nights because I thought there has to be a business  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:03:59):**  opportunity in this where you can make the land more healthy and also turn it into more profit for  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:08):**  the farmers. So that is when I decided to go into this field and try to find people who actually  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:15):**  knew something about agriculture and ecosystems, which I then did. And it led to ultimately the  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:23):**  establishment of this company. But I think Gijs has also probably a very interesting story to tell.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:31):**  Well, when I was a child, I always say, you know, once I get successful, I want to have a farm,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:38):**  because as a child, I always did some side jobs on farms and farms in the neighborhood where I was  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:43):**  born. Neither my parents or grandparents from both sides were farmers. So I have no idea where it  
**[0:04:50-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:50):**  comes from. But I always somehow like their mentality and their internal, everlasting optimism.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:04:59):**  So I studied finance. And after my first job, I got the luxury to do something that I wanted and  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:06):**  to do some traveling. So I decided to visit farms all around the world because I thought, yeah,  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:11):**  why wait until I'm done working? Why not make it my profession? So I started visiting farms in  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:18):**  Brazil, US, Eastern Europe. It's very easy because all around the world are Dutch farmers, and quite  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:25):**  successful farmers. So slowly, I began to learn more and more about agriculture. And one day,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:32):**  I found myself working in Zambia for an organization that said, Gijs, could you go check  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:38):**  out there? There's a lot of farmers there. We had some successful programs. And they went, they did  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:46):**  do some maize farming. And they do that better now. But we believe there's more to it. And we want to  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:51):**  do, we want to invest in those farmers. And so I'm walking to the Zambian forests. And that's where  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:05:58):**  I meet Tekla. And we started discussions together. And from one day to another, I find myself working  
**[0:06:05-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:05):**  with Tekla on the grounded. And I think our visions were quite similar at the time. And so by pursuing the things that I want, I finally  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:20):**  will have my agricultural job, some sort of say.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:25):**  You finally ended up on a farm. And what is grounded? I think it's the name is relatively new.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:31):**  Can you tell a bit more about the background, the vision, the theory of change? And why this name?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah, why this name is because we really focus on partnering with farmers. We believe that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:49):**  the problem of degraded land is caused primarily by, that's not a belief, it's actually a fact,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:06:58):**  is primarily caused by unsustainable farming practices. And we don't think that that is something  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:05):**  which you can necessarily blame the farmers for. So we shouldn't see them as a problem. We should  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:11):**  see the farmers actually as part of the solution. So what we do is we build very strong partnerships  
**[0:07:18-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:18):**  with farmers and develop businesses together with them. So we can help them to farm more profitably  
**[0:07:27-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:27):**  and more sustainably and in doing so regenerate degraded land. And because we work in Sub-Saharan  
**[0:07:36-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:36):**  Africa, it's actually quite difficult to invest in large scale in land. So because that would be a  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:46):**  model to do this, right? If you wanted to restore degraded land, you can just buy large pieces of  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:52):**  land and then control everything yourself. But we think that in this particular context,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:07:57):**  that's probably not the best intervention model. And so we have been looking for something which  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:04):**  on the one hand allows us to get to scale and on the other hand creates an impact. And that is why  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:11):**  we focus on the establishment of processing companies, which enable us to process high value  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:18):**  crops that we produce together with the farmers on the landscape, thereby allowing the farmers to  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:25):**  capture more value in the value chain. And at the same time create something which is investable,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:33):**  also for larger impact investors, which are interested in this space. And that also, of course,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:41):**  allows us to get to scale because these processing companies then process crops which are produced in  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:47):**  a sustainable and regenerative manner. And when you look at a concrete example of this,  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:08:54):**  which one would you pick from your fast growing portfolio as a perfect example or almost perfect  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:01):**  example of this method and this theory of change? For instance, the first project which we did was  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:10):**  actually in collaboration with Common Land, a big landscape restoration NGO and Living Lands,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:17):**  a South African NGO and a group of farmers in the Baviaanskloof in South Africa, which is a very  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:22):**  remote area where the big problem was overgrazing because of decades of goat farming. So the farmers  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:31):**  used to have goats, but the goats have eaten most of the natural vegetation in that area. So the  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:36):**  productivity of the land is going down while their input costs are increasing. So together with the  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:44):**  farmers and with our partner organization, we started on a journey to identify alternative  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:09:52):**  ways of farming. And eventually that has led to the establishment of an essential oils company.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:00):**  So we're currently growing herbs like lavender and rosemary, and we're starting to add some  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:07):**  indigenous herbs as well. And then we established a processing company in the area together with the  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:13):**  farmers that's processing the herbs into oils. And those oils are of course very durable. They're  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:20):**  super high value. They're compact, so it's easy to transport them out of a remote area and they're  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:26):**  sold into the cosmetics industry. And the farmers who sign up to this company also commit to a  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:33):**  holistic management plan for their farm, which means that they will reduce the number of goats  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:39):**  on their lands to make it more sustainable. So it's no longer further degrading the land. And  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:45):**  instead actually they make land available for restoration. So we've also formed a partnership  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:52):**  with a large beverage company who was active downstream to actually plant a lot of trees  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:10:59):**  on these degraded hillsides now that the farmers are taking off their goats. So I think that is  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:04):**  a really tangible example of how this model could work. And we're now busy in other areas as well.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:13):**  We're working in Zambia, Madagascar and another area in South Africa to see if we can replicate  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:21):**  this model, albeit in a different form, because every landscape is different of course.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:27):**  And that's what you mean when you say bringing agriculture back into balance?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:37):**  Yeah, what we mean by that is that it's actually, I think it's two things. It's on the one hand  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:45):**  on the ground, bringing agricultural practices back into balance with nature. So instead of  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:52):**  kind of literally slashing all the nature out of an area and making it into a complete controlled  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:11:59):**  environment, which is also sometimes less resilient to change. And in particular in the areas where we  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:06):**  work, which are very sensitive to, for instance, climate change, we don't think that that is  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:11):**  necessarily always the best model. So bringing agriculture in balance with nature rather than  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:17):**  fighting against it. And at the same time, bringing the agricultural value chain back into balance.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:25):**  So sharing more of the value which gets captured up in the value chain, for instance, in processing  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:32):**  and marketing with the farmers. So the farmers also get a much higher percentage of the final  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:39):**  end product than they do typically. And we believe if you do that, then you also enable the farmers to  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:45):**  actually make the changes which are needed on their land. Because if they are absolutely cash  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:49):**  stripped, which is often the case with the farmers we work with, they sometimes say to us like, yeah,  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:12:55):**  we understand that this is not the best way. And it's also not good for our children. But what do  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:01):**  we do? There's no other way, because we just have to survive from today until tomorrow. So if we can  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:10):**  create a little bit more space in the system, we can actually enable people to be like proper  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:18):**  custodians of the land and make it better for their children than it is now. And if you look  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:24):**  at your your daily practice, basically, I mean, you just changed the name of the company. But of  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:30):**  course, you've been doing this for a while. If you look back one year ago, so that will be February  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:36):**  or the end of January 2016. Until now, what has changed in the company and in your immediate  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:44):**  surrounding when you look at regenerative agriculture? Yeah, so a lot has changed in our  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:13:54):**  company. Although we're still running around. So I guess that's the that's the constant factor.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:00):**  But a year ago from now, we were just establishing the first lavender crops with the farmers in the  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:09):**  Baviaanskloof. We were just establishing the company together with them. Everything was new.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:15):**  And also, it was basically just me in the company. And where we've come now is we've grown the team  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:27):**  the team quite a bit. We have people working in all these different projects, as I mentioned.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:34):**  And in our first company that we established, the one in the Baviaanskloof, we've actually  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:39):**  produced the first oil, which was, of course, a really nice moment actually just recently in  
**[0:14:45-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:45):**  January. So it smells really nice now. The lavender flowers. And yeah, I think also a big change there  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:14:55):**  is that the farmers are now really taking ownership of this company and working really hard together  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:02):**  with us to make it into a success. So we've formed a real team, I think, together with the farmers.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:09):**  And that is what we're working to establish now in other projects as well. So I think it's super  
**[0:15:14-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:14):**  exciting. And I think I now hear six months and what's really difficult is if you want to do  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:24):**  sustainable farming and regenerative farming, it changes from place to place and from location to  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:32):**  location. The context differs a lot throughout even within nations in Africa. The differences are huge.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:42):**  And what we have developed last year, especially last half year, is to find a way to come into an  
**[0:15:51-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:15:51):**  area and to try to start from scratch and to go as efficiently as possible through different  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:00):**  steps, through a different approach, to end up with a totally new strategy and a way of working  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:07):**  that's specifically suited for that area. And that's one of the main challenges. But we believe  
**[0:16:14-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:14):**  that by going through a process and doing a specific approach and working together with  
**[0:16:23-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:23):**  farmers, really looking into the agronomic or the natural boundaries and maybe even more  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:32):**  important, the social boundaries of a project, that going through that phase, we can end up  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:38):**  in every place with a good strategy. Almost like a number of impact investors who do place-based  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:45):**  investing, meaning that they mostly invest in their region, which of course is different in every  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:50):**  region because it depends what the necessities are and what is necessary to do in that region.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:16:56):**  And you're saying almost it's place-based agriculture, really looking at what the landscape  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:04):**  can handle, what it needs, and both the landscape itself, meaning the soil, the waterways, the  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:11):**  ecosystems, etc. And of course, the people working, living and owning the land on top of that.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, exactly. And so that is also why it's so important to work really closely together with  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:22):**  the farmers, because often they have a lot of knowledge about what can grow there and what  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:29):**  could be successful crops, even though they're sometimes not growing them at the moment for  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:35):**  several reasons, because they don't have the capital to establish them or they don't have the  
**[0:17:39-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:39):**  markets. And yeah, we believe that if we can partner with them to find the right crops, which  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:48):**  are suitable for the climate, you can create a much more resilient system. Yeah, I would even say  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:17:55):**  anti-fragile, actually. Probably you create an agriculture system that is sometimes, especially  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:03):**  if you look at other systems, like neighbouring systems, is probably when there are climate shocks,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:09):**  it's suffering the least or maybe even benefiting because you are building such a strong soil  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:15):**  perspective. It's a very interesting perspective compared to an earlier interview we did with Tony  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:22):**  Lovell of SLM in Australia, where of course you have the opportunity to buy enormous pieces of  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:27):**  land from one owner and basically can do whatever you want on that, or you can build your whole  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:33):**  system exactly as you want it. But of course, in many places or most places in the world,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:38):**  there are many small farmers, smaller farmers, many people that own different pieces of land  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:44):**  and you need a social system to bring them all together under one shared future, because otherwise  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:50):**  it's bound to fail from the beginning. Yeah, exactly. And I think you also need an economic  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:18:58):**  trigger and that is what we try to create by focusing on these high value crops that we  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:04):**  process on the landscape. So it becomes really attractive for the farmers or it should become  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:11):**  really attractive for the farmers to participate in these companies because it allows them to create  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:18):**  more value from their land on an annual basis. So it decreases their risk and it increases their  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:25):**  profits. And when you look at this specific project in South Africa and the Bavian's Clove,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:31):**  can you share a bit of a few numbers? Like how many farms and farmers are we talking about? How  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:37):**  many hectares? What's the number of goats that's going down? How much lavender are you actually  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:44):**  able to produce and how much oil does come out of that? Just to have a bit of a feel about the  
**[0:19:48-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:48):**  scale we're talking about. Yeah, so we're working there. We started with only four farmers  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:19:58):**  and these are very large farms because it's extensive goat farming that they're doing there.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:04):**  So the average farm size is about 4000 hectare in that area, most of which is not arable, most of  
**[0:20:13-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:13):**  which is mountain land which is grazed by these goats. And so the total area that we're bringing  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:23):**  under improved management currently is around 28,000 hectare and the total area which we're  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:30):**  actively restoring by planting trees is around one and a half thousand hectares. So those are  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:37):**  millions of trees which are being brought back into the natural land where the goats have been  
**[0:20:44-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:44):**  removed. And then in terms of how many herbs we're establishing, we're almost finished planting 100  
**[0:20:53-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:20:53):**  hectare of essential oil crops, so that's both lavender and rosemary. And we think we have the  
**[0:21:03-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:03):**  potential to expand to about 250 hectare still, but already with this size we are one of the  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:12):**  biggest producers of these essential oils in South Africa. So the size of the project is considerable.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:23):**  Extremely interesting. And if you look one year from now, what would have changed or what do you  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:30):**  think has changed? Of course it's difficult to look in the future and for sure also a year from  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:36):**  now, but what are you working on that you think will have changed if we talk again February next  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:41):**  year? Yeah, so it's different for all of our projects. So in general we hope to have made a  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:48):**  lot of progress on all the projects that we're working in. For the Baviaanskloof area specifically,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:21:56):**  what we're currently busy with is to see how we can grow the company and in particular how we can  
**[0:22:01-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:01):**  also bring the bigger communities into the company. So this is the area in South Africa  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:10):**  where there's a lot of so-called historically disadvantaged South Africans. So we're currently  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:15):**  busy implementing a large-scale empowerment plan to get all of them involved, or not all of them,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:23):**  the ones who are interested, involved in becoming producers into the company as well.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:30):**  And I guess for the other projects Gijs can also explain a little bit. The goal for this year is to  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:36):**  again set up some small value chains. In Zambia we start this year with 20 farmers that were  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:46):**  locally selected by a local trainer. So you always need some pioneering farmers because it's very  
**[0:22:54-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:22:54):**  important to be successful in the beginning to attract more farmers later on. So we want to  
**[0:23:02-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:02):**  successfully plant some new crops and create a mixture of crops that we can grow, that we can  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:11):**  grow in a sustainable regenerative way and that we can sell. So there's a lot of steps to be done  
**[0:23:18-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:18):**  and of course process as well. We have agronomists on the team and we are quite sure we have, we're  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:27):**  very close to having a good mixture there. So next week we sit together with the farmers and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:34):**  we discuss some potential challenges etc. and from there on we start the process. So we start  
**[0:23:39-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:39):**  planting this year and we're making a processing facility this year. Another project as well in  
**[0:23:47-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:47):**  the Langkloof where we have a fine ball species that can promote or restore degraded fine balls.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:23:56):**  It's a natural vegetation in a large part of the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:01):**  And we can use that tree actually to restore land. It's a native tree and it's a very high  
**[0:24:09-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:09):**  value tree. It's called honey bush produced, used to produce honey bush tea which is healthy,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:18):**  nutritious and now completely harvested in the wild. And a lot of it is illegally harvested,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:26):**  and a lot of it is illegally harvested, poached in an unsustainable way. And we have a lot of  
**[0:24:33-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:33):**  farmers there that are really interested to grow it and learn to grow it and also to set up these  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:41):**  value chains because now a lot of the value sticks with middle man and stick in between.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:48):**  If you can do the processing yourself and only buy sustainable and sell to the end consumer,  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:24:54):**  you'll be able to give the farmers a fair share. And even in this specific scenario,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:00):**  you can give them such a high share that the very sustainable practices like bringing back  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:06):**  fine balls look very attractive at this point where we are now in the project.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:11):**  For those two projects, we really believe that this year we can set up those value chains.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:18):**  Also because we've done it before and we have quite fur down the line with, and that's always  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:26):**  something that you should not underestimate. For us it's very important to get that relation with  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:31):**  the farmers and that's something in the beginning that takes a lot of time. And that now goes very  
**[0:25:37-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:37):**  well in that project. So that's why we believe for this year on those very specific projects,  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:45):**  that's where we will be at the end of this year.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:48):**  And when you look at, you just mentioned and touched upon working with farmers,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:53):**  what do you see as what you've noticed in your experience as the biggest challenges  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:25:58):**  and also the biggest opportunities of working with farmers, especially in degraded land?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:03):**  Well, the thing is, Tekla already mentioned it a bit as well. It starts with listening very well.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:10):**  Farmers have a lot of local knowledge and one of the strange thing for me as a European,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:18):**  for example, to understand is that in Zambia, there are very good markets for a lot of crops.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:26):**  Almost everything is imported. I coming from a finance angle, always thought, okay, we need to  
**[0:26:32-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:32):**  sell to Europe, high value markets, easy to sell, we know a lot of people there. But it turned out  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:40):**  and the farmers pointed me to that, that the local markets are huge and the local prices  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:46):**  are often better than in Europe. And that is something that you only learn by listening to  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:26:54):**  farmers. And now it's just us doing a lot of talking, but most of our job is just to be very  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:02):**  sensitive to what they say. And later on, you can see, for example, Bill Gates once mentioned,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:09):**  if I would have been a farmer, I would have do chicken farming in Africa because the average  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:13):**  price of a chicken is $5. Who would believe that? And actually, it is like that because one of the  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:21):**  people I've met there does chicken farming himself and he sells his chicken for $4 or $5.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:26):**  So there's something strange going on that you have very good local prices and local markets.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:33):**  But it is just one out of many examples. And often, the second is maybe also very interesting.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:41):**  A lot of the farmers indicated in Zambia that their stable crop used to be sorghum and that they  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:47):**  stopped with that because the government promoted maize. So they gave cheap maize seeds and they  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:52):**  bought maize. But after years of drought and the drought has been going on for three years in a  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:27:58):**  row now, the older people were saying, you know, back in the days, the sorghum never let us down.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:05):**  So last year, we handed out sorghum seeds to 200 farmers and we wanted to make some micro  
**[0:28:12-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:12):**  finance scheme of it. So they needed to pay us back in bags of sorghum. However, the drought  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:21):**  was so enormous that all the maize failed and the only crop survived was the sorghum crop.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:27):**  So it was actually I didn't do anything than just following their advice. So I got to the  
**[0:28:36-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:36):**  donors of the project. I said, can you give me $6,000 or $7,000 to get the seeds to the farmers?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:44):**  And that was the only crop that returned something to them. So in the end, the donors decided to not  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:50):**  get back the sorghum from the farmers because it was the only thing they had. And it was not  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:28:55):**  my knowledge, not agronomic knowledge. It was just the older people who said that it was sorghum  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:01):**  that was the main crop until 20 years ago. And you see that just a small mixture, so doing  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:07):**  and maize and sorghum, which is far from the regenerative ideal scenario, but can also has a  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:14):**  big impact. And I think maybe if I can add to that in terms of like to go back to your question,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:22):**  Koen, on what are some of the challenges we're facing. So obviously, one of the biggest  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:31):**  challenges for us is that a lot of the farmers we work with, like I already mentioned earlier,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:37):**  are under severe cash flow pressures or financial pressure in general. So it means that  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:45):**  if they make a change in their current system, they're also taking a risk. So if it fails,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:29:52):**  then they have an even bigger problem than they have now. So that puts quite a lot of pressure  
**[0:30:00-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:00):**  on us as well as the farmers to make these things work. And I think in addition, a big challenge is,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:10):**  I think in any agricultural system, but what we're seeing here now, especially with, for instance,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:16):**  in this time period with El Nino and climate change having devastating effects this part of  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:24):**  the world, there's like the worst drought in South Africa in I think since they started recording,  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:30):**  is just the climate conditions that we need to work with, which put a lot of extra pressure on  
**[0:30:36-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:36):**  the farmers as well as on our systems. Yeah, sure. No, I think that the shocks from climate become  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:45):**  even worse. And for sure, I mean, in Europe, we notice it, but it's very different if your land  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:52):**  is already degraded and you're already suffering from a few degrees rise in temperature. Of course,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:30:58):**  you're much more vulnerable to even the smallest shock in the system. And I think that's a big  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:05):**  challenge for the agricultural system. And if you look at what have you been working on in the last  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:11):**  few months that really got you up at night because it was tricky or difficult or very exciting? I  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:19):**  mean, I think you already mentioned it a bit, maybe you can tell a bit more about the first  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:24):**  harvest and the first oil you made. How does that work and how did it make you feel after many years  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:29):**  of starting this project and working with these farmers and not knowing that you were going to  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:34):**  be able to do that? Yeah, that's a good question. Indeed, if you would have told me four years ago  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:40):**  that I would be involved in a lavender company, I would have probably laughed. But indeed,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:47):**  yeah, it was exciting. Of course, we had a lot of challenges in the beginning, right,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:51):**  because this was a new crop. And we're also doing it organic. And none of the farmers have been  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:31:58):**  before. So to transition from a conventional to an organic system is quite a challenge because  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:05):**  there's a lot of things that you actually need to have in place to make an organic system resilient,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:11):**  such as cover crops and things like that. And all of these were new to the farmers that we  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:18):**  were working with. Plus, it was a new crop. So some of the plants that we planted died,  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:25):**  then we had an outbreak of a pest on one of the farms where none of the experts that we spoke  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:31):**  with in the industry or in South Africa had ever seen this particular pest attacking rosemary  
**[0:32:37-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:37):**  plants, but it did. So that was a massive setback. But in the end, we actually managed to get quite  
**[0:32:48-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:48):**  an okay harvest and indeed to process it into oil. So the processing facility is now almost  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:32:57):**  finished, but we managed to improvise something in the meantime while it was not finished yet.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:04):**  So a lot of it is just like on the spot improvisation. And that is also something  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:10):**  which the farmers are really good at. So they actually took complete lead on this process.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:16):**  And yeah, it's just really nice to have the first oil. And now people are also starting to think  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:23):**  about what they can make with the oil. And because of course, you can make soap or shampoo or like  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:31):**  air spray or whatever. So we're starting to experiment a little bit with that. And yeah,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:37):**  I guess it was a massive inspiration for the entire project to be able to produce this first  
**[0:33:44-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:44):**  oil because it's actually giving us hope that this can actually work, even though we have still a lot  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:33:53):**  to learn. Yeah. Yeah, we believe the answer lie in looking for the correct crop in the correct  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:00):**  environment, you know, and a lot of people would say, no, well stick to the mace, stick to the  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:06):**  stick to the to the goat stick, be no David the familiar with it and use something straightforward.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:12):**  And then we also try to process it. You know, well, why would you process it? And I think  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:18):**  everybody is also looking, you know, the bigger the bigger the scale, the more profit you make,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:23):**  whereas actually, a lot of the lot of the products that come out of the land, you can process them  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:29):**  on a very small scale quite efficiently. And especially in Africa, where production, sorry,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:35):**  transportation costs are so high. Processing things locally really, really adds up. In addition,  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:45):**  you know, all the produce in Zambia, the prices are so high. So, but it's on all these different  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:51):**  things, you know, we work with farmers in Africa, we involve them. We work with large groups and on  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:34:58):**  every of these topics, you have to convince everybody and nobody, you know, agrees. So  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:04):**  wherever you come, it's it's it's a lot of explaining and with new partners, you know,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:10):**  we try to involve everybody, we try to bring everybody together. And that means to communicate  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:19):**  that throughout all the different stakeholders and partners that's that often requires a lot of work  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:26):**  and some restless sleeps in during the night. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, but I think maybe if  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:33):**  I can add something positive also on the result of following that strategy is, for instance, now I  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:39):**  already told you that we're in a very hectic drought in South Africa. The farmers in the  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:45):**  Bavianskove are saying that they've never experienced something like this before. But with  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:50):**  the new system that we've introduced, they are actually using more than 10,000 different  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:35:55):**  methods. They are actually using more than 10 times less water than they did before. And some  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:01):**  of the farmers even say that they think that if they would have been in their old system still,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:07):**  they would not have been able to continue running their farm. But because the crops we established  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:13):**  are really drought tolerant, it actually works for them. So I think it actually shows that there's  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:21):**  a lot of work in choosing the right crops which are suitable for the environment. Yeah, no,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:27):**  definitely. I think it came at the right time for some or hopefully many of these farmers.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:33):**  And when you look at because you mentioned at the beginning, these processing companies or the local  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:40):**  processing companies could be interesting or are interesting actually to impact investors. How are  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:46):**  you looking at that? And what stage do you think these companies become interesting for impact  
**[0:36:52-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:36:52):**  investors and how should they get involved in this process? Well, actually, you see that now  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:01):**  I'm generalizing, but there's a lot of processing capacity lacking throughout maybe entire Africa,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:10):**  but especially Sub Sahara Africa, everything is imported, as said before. So there's a huge  
**[0:37:15-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:15):**  potential for that. I think, and we believe that what you should do and what our approach is,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:27):**  is to try and start as quick as possible and try to start as a small scale. And from there on,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:35):**  learn your lessons, quickly adapt to situations and scale from up there. So even though the best  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:42):**  business cases on paper are to build up a bit processing facility, things are not as easy as  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:48):**  they may seem, especially not in these areas. It's hard to make sure you get a constant supply  
**[0:37:54-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:37:54):**  of inputs through your processing line and to get it to the market. However, if you want you,  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:03):**  you can prove you got something and you got something running and people see it, farmers  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:08):**  see it and experience it, then you have a totally new vibe of things. And then, you know, once it  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:14):**  starts working, everybody, more and more people want to join. And it's, if you want to have an  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:21):**  impact in Africa, you can, and you do the processing, you can compensate farms or give  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:26):**  them good prices for crops they grow in a sustainable way. And that link, I think, is crucial  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:33):**  because now a lot of the inefficiencies are in that value chain. And by taking control of that  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:40):**  value chain, as an impact investor, you can really have an impact on the farmers themselves. And I  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:47):**  think what we are doing is, you know, we see the cultivation side and the processing side as almost  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:38:54):**  as one organization. On paper, they might be apart, but if you can connect those two links,  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:01):**  your impact is huge. You know, the farmers know they have a market and the thing is about getting  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:07):**  the risk out of the farming system. And by getting farmers a good price and lowering the risk, they,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:15):**  for the first time, are enabled to make long-term decisions. And we believe that the regenerative  
**[0:39:21-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:21):**  agriculture is all about long-term. And the short-term vision that sometimes farmers are  
**[0:39:29-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:29):**  forced to have, that is where a lot goes wrong. So if you want to have both an impact and a good  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:37):**  financial return, because if you look to the value chain, a lot of the value is created within that  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:43):**  processing, I think processing offers a huge opportunity to both financial returns and impact  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:51):**  returns. I don't think there's a better way to end this interview than with that statement. I'm  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:39:57):**  very thankful for sharing this knowledge. I think it's very interesting to see almost an emerging  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:05):**  structure, a structure of seeing which business cases come out and being very  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:12):**  lean and looking at minimum viable products and modular, which we always do, of course,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:17):**  in software, but seeing that into the old field of agriculture, it makes it very interesting. And I  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:23):**  think it's the only way of seeing if something sticks and expanding on that instead of a very  
**[0:40:30-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:30):**  strict plan, 10-year plans, we're going to do this, this and this, because at the end,  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:34):**  nature always comes and, for instance, does climate change and they all new year together.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:39):**  So thank you both for your time here. And I'm pretty sure this is not the last time we'll be  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:44):**  checking in with your progress and your processes. A lot of good luck in the next months and  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:51):**  hopefully there will be many more products you didn't expect coming out of these processes,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:40:57):**  but that provide a good return to the farmers and restore a lot of land.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:41:02):**  Yeah, thank you very much, Koen. It's nice to talk to you. Thanks a lot.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/#t=0:41:07):**  You just listened to an interview with Gijsboers and Teklatoenus of Grounded. We talked about the

**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:14):**  What do you really know about soils?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:15):**  I can promise you, probably not nearly enough.

**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:25):**  soils don't need rotations, how plants actually feed themselves, and why you don't need expensive  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:31):**  chemical inputs that just benefit the input companies.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:41):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:45):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:50):**  people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:56):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food, and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:01:10):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:02):**  Thank you very much, Kon.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:03):**  Glad to be here.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:04):**  And a shout out to Francisco Telles, who introduced us and got you on the show.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:09):**  And I want to ask you a personal question.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:11):**  What got you into soil?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:12):**  What got you into regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:14):**  From all the other career paths you could have chosen, you chose this one.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:18):**  Yeah, it's kind of a long story because there were steps along the way.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:23):**  When I was a child, my father was a professor at the University of Minnesota, and he would  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:30):**  bring me into the laboratory.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:32):**  And my memory is that about six years old, my dad sat me down at a microscope because  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:38):**  he didn't want me wandering through the laboratory touching and getting all messy.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:42):**  So sit down here, kid, and here's how you use this microscope.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:45):**  And now I want you to count all the E. coli in all these samples.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:50):**  And I had the greatest time.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:51):**  That was so much fun.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:52):**  I'm not sure that I gave him any statistically significant data, but it kept me out of trouble.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:02:59):**  And I loved it.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:00):**  And he used to take me out on farm with him when he went to look at dairy herds.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:05):**  And he would send me out into the fields to look for poisonous plants.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:12):**  And did the farmer in their fields have adequate food for the cows to eat?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:20):**  Or was this person feeding his cows with just Purina cow chow, stuff out of a bag, which  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:28):**  is extremely high in salt, had high levels of lead, had all kinds of other problems.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:33):**  And so he wanted to know what was the condition of the pasture, which kind of introduced me  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:39):**  to soils that were really horrific and would grow nothing but weeds versus other farmers  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:46):**  that really were doing a good job.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:48):**  And I didn't think about these things in a scientific manner yet, but that question of  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:03:54):**  why is one person's field gorgeous and beautiful and the grasses, all kinds of forbs and herbs  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:02):**  and wonderful things and the cows are fat and happy versus right next door, there's  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:06):**  this other field that's nothing but weeds.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:09):**  What's going on here?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:10):**  So as I went through college, my parents both pushed me very strongly to go to medical school.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:18):**  So I had submitted my applications and I was going to go to medical school in the fall,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:24):**  but I happened to take microbiology in the last quarter of my senior year of college  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:30):**  and decided that I liked microbiology way more than I liked being a medical doctor.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:37):**  So I'm not comfortable really with telling other people what they should be doing to  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:44):**  fix their health, although of course I am now doing that sort of thing because what's  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:50):**  in your soil is what has to get into your digestive system and it's got to, the biology  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:04:57):**  is what determines the nutrients that are in your foods.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:00):**  So yeah, kind of the back doorway to help people become healthy.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:06):**  So I worked in a heart hospital then during the summer of my senior year in college and  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:13):**  many of the professors that I was working in their labs, I was the dishwasher and I  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:19):**  kind of got to see all the nastiness that actually happens in those laboratory situations  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:26):**  and I did not like the people who were going to be my professors in the fall.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:33):**  And so I decided not to go to medical school, sorry, I'm not interested, applied to graduate  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:40):**  school and so I headed down to Texas A&M the next fall and started graduate school at Texas  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:48):**  A&M in marine microbiology.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:51):**  But it did introduce me to the fact that the methodology that most soil scientists use,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:05:58):**  that even marine scientists use to measure bacteria or fungi or protozoa or nematodes  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:06):**  in their systems are completely inappropriate.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:10):**  You can't make the interpretations using plate counts about the total set of microorganisms  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:18):**  in an oyster's digestive system or in the soil or on surfaces of leaves.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:25):**  It's incorrect.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:26):**  And why is that?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:27):**  Because it's not the whole picture of why is that so incorrect for anybody that hasn't  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:32):**  looked in a microscope for a long time and isn't studying soil or oyster digestive systems.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:38):**  I'm going to answer that with a little bit of an explanation of the experiment that you  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:42):**  do to figure this one out.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:45):**  So the classic method for doing total bacterial or fungal numbers in soil or in any environmental  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:06:54):**  sample would be to take a particular petri dish filled with a particular kind of medium.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:03):**  And the medium typically used for bacteria is tryptone soil agar and the medium used  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:10):**  for fungi.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:12):**  It's a particular medium with a very limited set of food resources in it.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:17):**  So you plate your sample that may in fact have somewhere as high as 75,000 species being  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:28):**  spread on that plate.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:30):**  But the only things that grows are those things that can utilize that particular food resource.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:39):**  But remember also that you're incubating that plate at one temperature and that is unnatural.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:46):**  There is no place on the planet that you go where you have the same temperature all day  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:51):**  long and all night long.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:54):**  They're used to a fluctuation.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:07:57):**  So what you see when you do that is you're going to see a completely distorted, very  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:01):**  narrow part of reality of what's out there.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:05):**  And typically you get one or two different species growing on that plate.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:10):**  From the 75,000 you just mentioned.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:14):**  And so for fungi it's not quite as bad.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:16):**  Out of the 25,000 species of fungi you spread on that potato dextrose agar there.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:21):**  I remember the name.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:22):**  Oh, it's only one third.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:25):**  So only potato.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:27):**  What's the food resource when we make potatoes, mashed potatoes?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:31):**  Well it's one particular kind of food resource.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:34):**  And then you have the dextrose, which is one particular form of one of the millions of  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:41):**  different sugars that are out there on this planet.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:44):**  And so of course you're restricting the growth of who actually grows.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:48):**  So this is by no means a total community of bacteria or fungi that they were looking at.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:08:55):**  They were looking at something that really comes out about 0.000000001% of the actual  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:06):**  community of microorganisms.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:09):**  And that was the case when you started studying?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:11):**  Is that still the case?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:13):**  Many people still do the same.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:16):**  Exactly that.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:17):**  Soil scientists who haven't read a book since they left graduate school, they're still mired  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:24):**  back in this inappropriate understanding of what's actually going on in soil.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:30):**  They have no clue.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:32):**  When I started my PhD work at Colorado State University in soil, my major professor told  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:39):**  me to go and talk to all of the other professors in the university that dealt with soil.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:45):**  So go talk to those soil scientists, go talk to the agronomists, go talk to the hydroponics  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:52):**  people, go talk to crop scientists, go and spend some time.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:57):**  And I did that.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:09:59):**  And when I asked those people this thing that I'm going to work on the bacteria and the  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:07):**  fungi in soil, what's their purpose in soil?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:10):**  What do the bacteria and fungi do?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:12):**  How important are the bacteria and fungi for plant growth, for production, agriculture?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:20):**  And to a man, they said, oh, they don't really do anything.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:24):**  They're unimportant.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:26):**  You should not do a PhD on this subject because there's no future in it.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:33):**  Boy, they were wrong.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:35):**  Oh, man.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:36):**  But they were so blinded by the methodology that they'd been taught, none of them had  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:42):**  thought about this.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:44):**  This doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:46):**  If you take a drop of liquid from someplace, from your soil or from your oyster's digestive  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:10:52):**  system, and you plate it on that plate, you get one or two different species of bacteria  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:00):**  or fungi.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:01):**  But when you take a drop of that same material, put a drop on the microscope slide, cover  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:07):**  that with a cover slip, and you look in just one field of view, and there are approximately  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:15):**  2,300 fields of view in that drop under that microscope.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:22):**  What's a field of view?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:23):**  When you look through the microscope and you're seeing that round circle of light, and you  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:28):**  can see what's going on in that field of view, and there are 2,300 fields of view as you  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:35):**  go through that whole cover slip.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:38):**  Literally, this petri dish, it's so big.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:42):**  You zoom, and then you can zoom even further, but you have, wow.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:46):**  How many do you see?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:47):**  Because I interrupted you.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:48):**  Well, this is actually when, on the petri dish, I take a drop of the solution and put  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:53):**  it on there.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:54):**  Then I can take a drop of the same solution and put it on a microscope slide.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:11:58):**  And then I'll cover, I'll put a glass slide on that drop so that you have a uniform depth  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:05):**  of that liquid that you're looking at.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:07):**  And then you can count the number of bacteria in each field of view.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:12):**  And each field of view would have somewhere around 15 to 16 different species of bacteria  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:21):**  that I could see the differences in their morphology.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:24):**  So I knew I had at least 15 to 16 different species of bacteria and maybe a couple different  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:31):**  species of fungi.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:33):**  Multiply that by the 2,300 fields of view, and you can see where we get up to this massive  
**[0:12:40-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:40):**  number of species and individuals pretty rapidly, which is completely the opposite of what you're  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:49):**  getting from those plate counts.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:51):**  So nobody ever put a liquid from the soil under a microscope.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:12:56):**  That's what we're, or did it, and then sort of didn't believe it, and then went back to  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:01):**  growing medium and okay, let's see what we get there.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:03):**  Yeah, they never questioned the discrepancy between what the microscope was telling them  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:10):**  and what plate counts were telling them.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:12):**  Yeah, just completely right over the top of their head.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:16):**  And so you saw that, and then what?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:18):**  So what I did was I worked on methods of assessing total fungi and bacteria in soil and a method  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:27):**  for determining whether they were active in soil.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:32):**  So we could differentiate those organisms who were awake and functioning from the rest  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:37):**  of the organisms that were hanging out, waiting for the right conditions to become active  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:43):**  and start helping your plant.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:45):**  So once I finished my PhD, I worked with a group at the Natural Resource Ecology Lab  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:52):**  at Colorado State University headed up by Dave Coleman, who wanted to know what were  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:58):**  the functions.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:13:59):**  You can tell that these guys are all active, but what are they actually doing?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:05):**  They are doing something.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:07):**  What's the something that they're doing?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:10):**  And so my husband, who is a nematologist, he works in soil.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:15):**  He works with the critters that eat my critters.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:19):**  So yeah, we have interesting dinner time conversation.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:23):**  That's a fun relationship.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:26):**  Both my kids went into the world of entertainment because my husband and I, I think, bored them  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:31):**  silly by constantly having these conversations about bacteria and fungi and who's eating  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:37):**  them and which nematode and how do you identify that.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:40):**  But we worked out his PhD work was to take soil and sterilize it and then start adding  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:48):**  in each organism group to that sterile soil, seeing what effect it had on the plant.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:14:56):**  And when all you do is put in one kind of group of organisms, the plants die.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:02):**  If you put in predators and prey such that the exudates coming out of the root system  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:10):**  of the plant, feeding the bacteria or feeding the fungi, getting those bacteria and fungi  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:17):**  to make the enzymes, to pull the nutrients out of the sand, the silt, the clay, the rocks,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:24):**  the pebbles in your soil, storing those nutrients in their bodies so nothing leeches, nothing's  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:31):**  lost when water moves through the system.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:34):**  When the predators come along, they eat those bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:38):**  And because the nutrient concentration that the predators have is so much lower than what's  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:45):**  in the bacteria and fungi, those predators are forced to release the nutrients in a plant  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:53):**  available form.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:15:56):**  So there's how nature actually converts the total nutrients in your soils.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:04):**  There is no soil on this planet that lacks the nutrients to grow plants.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:09):**  It is these biological interactions that release those nutrients in a plant available form  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:15):**  so your plant says, thank you, thank you, thanks for putting all the nutrients I need  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:21):**  right outside my root hair and takes it up.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:26):**  Like being in a supermarket, but all the shelves are covered up.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:31):**  I mean, let's say a good supermarket with good food, let's not take the average one,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:35):**  but all the shelves are covered with plastic.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:38):**  You can see it, but you cannot touch it.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:40):**  But all this life in the soil makes it accessible.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:44):**  It's actually probably a worst case scenario.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:47):**  It's as if all of the food in all of those shelves were encased in stone.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:52):**  Who's going to be able to, you know, a human being could reach between the plastic pretty  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:57):**  easily and get the food they want.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:16:59):**  But if it's encased in stone, what, you got to go to the supermarket with your pickaxe  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:03):**  and, you know, stand there and chisel?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:06):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:08):**  Let something else, let the bacteria and fungi do that work for you.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:12):**  When the protozoa nematodes eat those bacteria and fungi, here's the foods coming from that  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:18):**  interaction that you as a human being could pick up very easily.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:23):**  You don't have to do any work at all.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:25):**  So we don't need to set up diffusion gradients.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:28):**  We don't need all these explanations that soil scientists are talking about.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:33):**  Your plant has to pull the nutrients into its root system from a meter, three meters  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:40):**  away.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:41):**  That's just ridiculous.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:44):**  Let that plant have the food handed to it.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:47):**  And my favorite example of this is to look at this nutrient cycling system in the soil  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:53):**  kind of like the pizza delivery guy.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:17:57):**  The plant calls up the pizza parlor.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:00):**  So here's the exudates.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:01):**  Here's the message going to the pizza parlor saying, here's what I need you to do.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:07):**  And the guys at the pizza parlor say, oh yeah, sure, you want cheese with bacon or you want  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:12):**  pepperoni and sausage or you want extra cheese, whatever.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:16):**  They make exactly what the plant wants.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:20):**  And so that's the function and the role of the bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:23):**  They're making the pizzas with the proper kinds of foods in that pizza.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:28):**  Well then you hand that pizza off to the pizza delivery guy.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:32):**  That's the predator.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:34):**  That's the nematode or the protozoan or the earthworm or the micro arthropod.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:38):**  And that pizza delivery guy delivers exactly the nutrients that your plant wants to the  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:45):**  doorstep.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:46):**  And hopefully it's still warm.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:48):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:49):**  Hopefully it's still warm.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:50):**  Well, you know, your plant would go, no, I don't want that.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:53):**  It's not warm enough.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:54):**  You know, it could be.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:55):**  And send it back.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:18:58):**  Because they're getting everything they want.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:01):**  So you discovered this, which is a huge discovery.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:05):**  You could have spent the rest of your life in academia looking into this, but you decided  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:10):**  to set up a company working with farmers out there and not just in the university, let's  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:15):**  say experimental farm.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:17):**  What was the process like?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:19):**  Well for me, it was in academia finding these things.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:23):**  And that's not the only benefit we found for plants because if we get the right sets of  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:29):**  biology in the soil, they will physically cover the surfaces, both below ground and  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:34):**  above ground and prevent any diseases from being able to attack your plant.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:40):**  So not only are we improving plant resistance to disease by making certain that plant's  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:47):**  getting all the nutrients it wants in the correct balances because it's the exudate  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:19:54):**  the plant's putting out that tells which bacteria and which fungus to go and get which nutrient.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:00):**  And so the plant's going to get the nutrients it wants.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:03):**  Its health is increased by 90%.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:07):**  And then we're going to make certain that the surfaces above and below ground, the fruit,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:11):**  the seed, the leaves, the bark, the roots, everything are protected from disease and  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:16):**  pest attack by getting the covering of these organisms back into the system.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:22):**  The organisms build structure in the soil.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:25):**  So you will never have this situation of a compaction layer ever again.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:30):**  Your root systems won't be limited in their ability to grow down into the soil and get  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:36):**  all the water they need from the water that should be stored in the structure of that  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:41):**  soil.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:42):**  So there's all these benefits.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:44):**  And yet when I started wanting to have field trials done to do work out at the farms, the  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:54):**  university farm, the responses I got were, well, you're going to have to go out and find  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:20:59):**  funding.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:00):**  We don't have any money to put towards your research because we don't think your research  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:06):**  is really all that important.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:08):**  If microorganisms did all these wonderful things for the plant, then why hasn't somebody  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:13):**  else already found that out?  
**[0:21:15-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:15):**  Well, because what we've done in agriculture starting back in the late 1800s with the mechanical  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:25):**  plow where people could go out and plow 10, 20, 50, 100 acres on a daily basis.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:33):**  It's so easy to go out and do that plowing, get rid of the weeds, well, but for only about  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:38):**  two weeks to get rid of the compaction layers, but then you've killed, you've sliced, you've  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:43):**  diced all the organisms that do the job of rebuilding that structure.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:50):**  So your soil compacts worse than it ever did before.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:53):**  You get compaction layers at the surface where salts are left behind as water evaporates.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:21:59):**  Well, where did those salts come from?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:01):**  It came from the inorganic fertilizers that you were told that you have to use in order  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:06):**  to be able to grow these plants.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:08):**  Why would you possibly need inorganic fertilizer inputs into your soil where you have literally  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:15):**  thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years worth of nutrients already present in  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:22):**  that soil?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:24):**  Why do you have to add more?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:25):**  Well, it's present in the wrong form.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:29):**  Those nutrients are in the soil in a not leachable, not plant available form.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:34):**  You have to have the microorganisms do the conversion.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:37):**  Well, if you just sliced and diced and crushed all of those organisms by tilling two to 14  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:44):**  times through a growing season, and then if you're putting out inorganic fertilizers,  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:49):**  which are all salts, which will kill the organisms in the soil.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:22:54):**  So if we didn't kill you with the plow, we will kill you with the high concentrations  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:00):**  of salts that are going out.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:02):**  And if we didn't kill you using those two methods, then we're going to kill you when  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:06):**  we put out fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, miticides, herbicides.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:13):**  And so most of soils that we see when we go out and look for the biology in the soil is  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:18):**  there is nothing beneficial to your plant.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:21):**  Empty.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:22):**  Empty.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:23):**  You might find some bacteria, but they're not good bacteria.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:26):**  They're the disease causing bacteria.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:29):**  So you're putting your seed into a substrate that is chock full of things just waiting  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:36):**  to attack and consume.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:38):**  So they're not going to get the right nutrients.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:40):**  They're going to be stressed from day one when they germinate and start to grow.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:46):**  So trying to figure out why people were so negative about, but wait a minute, this is  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:52):**  the way nature works.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:23:54):**  This is how nature has been feeding plants for the last, well, how long have plants existed  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:00):**  on this planet?  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:01):**  A million years.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:04):**  Nature's been at this for a billion years.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:06):**  Do you think maybe she's had the time to figure things out?  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:10):**  And human beings in our arrogance think that we figured it all out in the last hundred  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:15):**  years.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:18):**  And I realized then that the reason none of these soils people, the agronomists, the plant  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:26):**  biologists, the botanists, all of those people, the reason they weren't interested is there  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:31):**  was no source of money for them to switch to understanding nature.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:36):**  There was no company that would give them the grants that would give them the funding.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:42):**  Whereas as things were, all these chemical companies are out there and for example, Monsanto  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:49):**  at Oregon State University, it was $75 million a year that was coming just from Monsanto.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:24:56):**  No wonder they weren't looking beyond the few bacteria that grew.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:01):**  They don't want to bite the hand that feeds them.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:04):**  They don't want to destroy the cash cow.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:07):**  And so they didn't want to hear this.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:11):**  So I was kind of relegated to the back row, not getting any financial support, not getting  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:19):**  any ability to get a plot on the research farm.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:22):**  The answer always was, well, there's a waiting list of 35 other people waiting for plots  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:30):**  on the research farm.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:31):**  I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait your turn.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:34):**  And yet I'd go out to the research farm because I would get involved in other people's research  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:38):**  and there were all kinds of fields that there was no crop.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:42):**  There was nobody doing anything with them.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:44):**  Why couldn't I have used that wheat field?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:47):**  And excuse after excuse after excuse.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:49):**  And it became very apparent, especially when I kind of butted heads with Monsanto over  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:25:56):**  genetically engineered organisms that academia was not the place for me.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:03):**  Academia is not what it's touted to be.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:08):**  I like to think of back in the day when I was in this situation back in the early 1990s,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:15):**  associate professor at Oregon State University, trying to get my research done, trying to  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:20):**  find funding, having a hard time getting that because the research funding was shrinking  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:27):**  by massive amounts on an annual basis.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:31):**  I finally really considered my goals.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:34):**  And I really didn't want to be fighting the academic world for the rest of my life because  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:40):**  clearly that was the road.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:43):**  Yeah, the people who weren't interested in learning anything new were never going to  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:49):**  listen to me.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:50):**  So where is my effort really being directed?  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:55):**  It's at growers.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:26:57):**  I need to be talking to growers and quite a few growers were working with me.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:03):**  And we were having really good results.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:05):**  So the demonstration plots were out there.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:09):**  It just happened to be on people's private land where I could go out and I could teach  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:14):**  them how to make compost so that they would have all these really good sets of organisms.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:20):**  And today we call that bio complete compost where you've got all the organisms to do the  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:28):**  changes, get them into the soil.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:31):**  And we started to realize with time that if you're trying to grow weeds, you want this  
**[0:27:37-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:37):**  kind of food web, this group in these concentrations with this much species diversity.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:47):**  If what you want to grow weeds, if that's what you want to grow, then great.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:51):**  These are going to be your friends.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:53):**  This is what you want to be putting in there.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:55):**  Well, most people don't want to grow weeds.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:27:57):**  So now if I want to grow asparagus, you better put in a different composition of those microorganisms.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:04):**  And it's just balanced between the bacteria and fungi, protozoa and nematodes.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:08):**  Well, if you want to grow corn, you need this.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:11):**  You need an equal balance of fungi and bacteria.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:14):**  But if you want to grow blueberries, you need twice as much fungal biomass as you do bacterial.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:19):**  And it's got to be all good guys, not bad guys.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:22):**  So we teach people how to grow the good guys just by controlling the conditions in your  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:30):**  compost pile, the initial starting materials that you put into that compost pile.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:36):**  Compost is not made by throwing a bunch of organic matter together in a pile and leaving  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:41):**  it for a while.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:43):**  If you really want compost that's got all these organisms and the organisms you want,  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:48):**  you've got to put in the correct recipe that will select for the growth of what you need.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:54):**  What do you have to put back into your soil?  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:56):**  What's missing in your soil?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:28:59):**  And we can help you, first of all, assay what is in your soil.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:04):**  So we teach people how to use microscopes or you send samples into a lab where somebody's  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:10):**  learned how to do these assessments and they can give you the data back.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:14):**  So you can see immediately, well, I want to grow really top-notch corn, but my soil has  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:21):**  no fungi in it.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:22):**  I've been tilling too much.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:24):**  I've been putting on fungicide.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:25):**  Guess what?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:26):**  If you put a fungicide on, you kill the good guys faster than you kill the bad guys.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:32):**  Bad guys have gotten resistant.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:33):**  The good guys haven't.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:36):**  So we've got to make certain all that fungicide is gone.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:41):**  It's all decomposed.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:42):**  It's taken care of.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:43):**  So you can have, we increase yields easily by more than 20 to 30% in the first growing  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:51):**  season.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:52):**  We reduce disease so that you don't need any pesticides.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:29:57):**  When you get the balance of bacteria and fungi right, when you have more ammonium than you  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:02):**  do nitrate in your soil, your weeds can't grow.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:07):**  So you don't have to be using herbicides.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:09):**  Your root systems are going deeper into the soil.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:12):**  Your soil is holding water better.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:14):**  All that organic matter that's being produced by the actions of the microbes.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:19):**  There's no downside to getting this biology.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:23):**  Except for the input guys, obviously.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:25):**  Yeah, well I don't.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:26):**  But yeah, let's not feel sorry for them.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:28):**  And so when you say we, who is we?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:31):**  Because you build a company around helping growers and farmers to do this and to put  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:36):**  this into practice, to put us into the field basically.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:38):**  Can you describe we for a second?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:41):**  So we is the Soil Food Web School where we've put together the online courses that people  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:48):**  can take at their own speed.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:50):**  We don't care if it takes you six months or a year or even two years to get all the way  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:55):**  through the course.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:30:56):**  But of course, if you want to be able to do agriculture the way I'm talking about, you  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:03):**  do want to get through those online courses.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:06):**  There have been people who've gotten through the online courses in three days.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:11):**  So it's possible.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:13):**  This was all before COVID.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:15):**  Just to be clear, you've built this online way before we all got online basically.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:20):**  And that has given you an enormous reach obviously and enormous flexibility for growers to follow  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:26):**  this, to learn wherever they are, as long as there's an internet connection.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:31):**  You don't have to go to university.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:32):**  You don't have to go to a class and arrive every night for weeks on end.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:38):**  You just turn your computer on and you start watching where you left off.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:42):**  We then have advanced courses.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:44):**  So if somebody wants to become a microscope technician, we have another eight hours that  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:51):**  we put on the end of the foundation courses.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:31:55):**  The foundation courses are the basic sets where we teach you all the information.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:02):**  We teach you how nature works, and then you can get a little bit more experience on identifying  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:08):**  all these organisms and become confident that you know what you're identifying.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:13):**  And then if you really like all of that, you can move on and become a consultant.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:19):**  Consultants typically take a full year, maybe two years to get through that consulting course,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:26):**  because we want them to show us that they took dirt, which has no organisms and no organic  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:34):**  matter, has plenty of minerals.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:36):**  It's got the sand, soil, clay, rocks, and pebbles.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:38):**  So you've got all the nutrients you could ever want, but you're lacking the biology.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:43):**  So how do you get those organisms back into the soil?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:46):**  We're going to convert your dirt back into soil.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:50):**  And so that typically takes people a growing season to go through that and become a consultant.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:57):**  And how many people have done that so far?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:32:59):**  Right now we're probably up around 15 to 20 consultants that have gotten all the way through  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:05):**  because it does take time.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:06):**  And they're globally, I'm imagining.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:08):**  Right, all over the world.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:10):**  The only place we don't have a consultant on the continent is the Antarctic.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:17):**  How many crops grown in the Antarctic, so I think we're okay.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:21):**  So there are people everywhere that are certainly close enough to anybody that they can do that  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:29):**  consulting, that they should be able to get out to your farm with a little bit of travel.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:34):**  Of course, that's not going to probably happen right now with the COVID virus.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:39):**  But as soon as the vaccination is-  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:42):**  Somebody within a day can come and visit.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:44):**  And how many farmers have gone through or are going through, which are going through  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:48):**  the process until the consultant?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:50):**  Like, are there hundreds or thousands?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:53):**  What's the-  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:54):**  In the foundation courses, there's over a thousand.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:33:56):**  I think we're probably up around more around 1500 students going through the foundation  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:02):**  courses who have gone through the foundation courses this year.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:07):**  But then there's probably another 60 to 70 people that are doing the microscope training  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:15):**  to be able to do samples for people.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:18):**  And then we have 120 students going through the consulting course to become consultants.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:27):**  So in a year or two, there will be a big group of those 120, for sure, not all, but will  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:32):**  be consultants, which grows your group of consultants massively, basically, from 20  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:37):**  to that.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:38):**  It's a lot.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah, it makes it a lot.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:41):**  And that will give you a good global lead.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:43):**  It gives us the probability that a consultant will be physically much closer to any client  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:50):**  that wants to sign up.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:53):**  And then because you've made a very conscious decision to do all of this online, do you  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:34:58):**  remember when that happened or how that happened, because for many, they may be thinking it  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:03):**  now as we're in COVID.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:04):**  But you did that way before that happened.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:07):**  What was the process there that you saw the potential of the Internet and saw the potential  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:12):**  of video courses or courses in general?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:13):**  Do you remember?  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:14):**  I first started recording my lectures back when I was at Oregon State University.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:21):**  So back in the late 1980s, I started recording so that people could buy the tapes.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:32):**  So they were on that old, the tapes originally, and then we went to CDs and expanded it from  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:39):**  three lectures to six lectures, because there were so many questions coming from people  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:46):**  about, well, but how do I do it under these situations?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:49):**  What happens?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:50):**  What did you mean when you said and how long does it have to be at that temperature?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:55):**  And when I added into the, all those questions.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:35:58):**  So we started expanding the number of lectures.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:02):**  So then in 2010 to 2011, started converting everything to online courses.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:11):**  So with a fair amount of help to get the computer part of the system to do that, we started  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:19):**  selling the online courses.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:21):**  Back then that was with a different group called the ECI, and I don't work with them  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:26):**  anymore at all.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:28):**  And so we started the Soil Food Web School in 2018, or I think January of 2019 is when  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:37):**  we started the Soil Food Web School, went through and completely redid all of the online  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:44):**  videos, all that explanation, because so many improvements had happened in the last four  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:51):**  to five years.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:52):**  It's, well, you know, the regenerative people, you know, work, the connection between regenerative  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:36:59):**  agriculture and biological, they really go very much hand in hand.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:04):**  So we don't teach a lot of the regenerative methods because you guys do, those folks do  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:11):**  a great job at that.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:13):**  So we work together, you really need to understand both to be highly successful, and then you've  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:20):**  got quite a community of people behind you to answer any question that you have.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:27):**  So we have several different forums that if you're taking the foundation classes, there's  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:32):**  at least three different forums where we answer questions and as the students learn, they  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:38):**  start to answer the questions.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:41):**  We're viewed by myself and a couple of helpers to make sure that the correct information  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:47):**  is going out.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:48):**  But we recognize that everybody has specific questions to what they're doing and they would  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:55):**  like to have those answered as rapidly as possible.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:37:59):**  So we try for a one day turnaround, not always successful.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:04):**  No, I can imagine.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:05):**  Like just this week.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:06):**  Of course.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:08):**  So I think for a lot of listeners on the podcast, it's absolutely fascinating to hear more about  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:14):**  soil, but they're also wondering and they're also wondering about, okay, I'm investing  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:19):**  in this space.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:20):**  I would love to invest in this space.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:21):**  So they get very enthusiastic from what you've seen working with thousands of farmers visited.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:26):**  I don't know how many farms have seen this change from a lifeless soil to a soil full  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:31):**  of life.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:32):**  And you seeing now, I think the interest in regenerative agriculture is growing, the interest  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:36):**  in soil is growing.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:37):**  If you would be an investor, what would be the questions you ask or what would be the  
**[0:38:41-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:41):**  things to look out for?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:42):**  What's the most exciting thesis, like what you've seen in this agriculture movement that's  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:47):**  really starting to bubble, which means there's a lot of noise as well.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:51):**  And I think for a lot of investors that didn't study soil science, how do I filter the noise  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:56):**  from the real interesting things?  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:38:58):**  Or how do I assess a farmer that's doing like, what should I ask and what should I look for?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:03):**  Well, it is kind of classic measures of plant health.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:08):**  Is there a lot of disease?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:10):**  This property that says that they're going to sustainable methods.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:15):**  You can't be sustainable if you're constantly battling pests and disease fungi and root  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:22):**  knot nematodes and all the bad guys.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:25):**  That's not sustainable.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:27):**  So you can't be sustainable if you've got a lot of weeds that come up every year.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:33):**  That's just, you're not paying attention to the messages that mother nature is sending  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:37):**  them.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:39):**  So kind of classical assessments of products.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:42):**  Observing.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:45):**  And we usually increase yields by at least 20%.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:51):**  So if they're doing things right, if the farmer is doing things correctly, they're seeing  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:39:55):**  those increases in yields and they're not having to pay for the pesticides, the herbicides,  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:01):**  the inorganic fertilizers, they don't need to be tilling their property every year.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:07):**  So this is very much a no-till proposition.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:10):**  And there are a couple of different ways to do no-tills.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:13):**  So we work with the farmer to figure out what they're most comfortable with.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:18):**  What do they have the equipment for?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:20):**  I don't want to be telling them that they have to buy massive amounts of new equipment.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:26):**  We can modify their existing equipment to be able to do the biological approach.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:34):**  So listening to mother nature and doing the biological approach, it sounds like a new  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:38):**  dance, doesn't it?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:40):**  So it's the same kinds of criteria if you're an investor, but you want to make sure that  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:45):**  there is no tillage happening.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:48):**  Every time you till 50% of the carbon in your soil is going to be blown off as CO2.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:53):**  So how can you be sustainable if you're tilling?  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:40:58):**  The farmer has to figure out the way to go no-till and we can do it with every crop,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:03):**  honest to God, come take the foundation courses and you'll learn that.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:08):**  So I don't have to explain all that.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:11):**  No, no.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:12):**  I think it's for anybody interested in this space, go and talk to farmers, go and really  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:17):**  experience this and go and do courses, read books.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:21):**  But at the end of the day, you need to see this, feel it, touch it, understand it, the  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:25):**  difficulties, the challenges, the opportunities, the enormous pieces we don't know yet and  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:29):**  the enormous pieces we do know yet.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:31):**  And I mean, let's hope that the balance...  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:34):**  And making sure that you have the right ones.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:36):**  You've got to make certain you have the right ones.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:39):**  And as you just said, the balance has to be there.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:43):**  It's all about the conditions in your soil that select for the beneficials.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:49):**  And then once you're working on getting the conditions right, you should be inoculating  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:41:55):**  those microorganisms that will help your plants.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:01):**  You shouldn't, however, have to be applying that inoculum of beneficial organisms every  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:08):**  month or every week or next year.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:12):**  Once you get them established, they have to be sustainable.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:15):**  And if you don't have the conditions right-  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:17):**  They have to stay.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:19):**  If you keep losing them, then this isn't sustainable.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:23):**  You've got to figure out what you're doing wrong.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:26):**  And we certainly can help people figure out what they're doing wrong so that you apply  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:31):**  the biology, you can document that they're there, and that's where we need people using  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:36):**  the microscope so that you don't have to keep adding them.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:40):**  I mean, all my least favorite companies on the planet, they're all trying to get in on  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:46):**  the biology thing where they offer jugs of microbes.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:53):**  Bugs in a jug is what we call them.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:42:56):**  And you're supposed to be putting these bugs in a jug out every month.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:01):**  You're going to have to go and reinoculate them.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:02):**  You're going to have to put them out.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:04):**  Geez.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:05):**  If you fall for that line, I guess you deserve to fork out.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:10):**  It's a business model.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:12):**  But-  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:13):**  You're going to lose a lot of money.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:15):**  And that's a good bridge to a question I love to ask, especially to people who are not in  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:19):**  the investment space.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:21):**  What would you do if you would wake up tomorrow or today?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:23):**  I mean, it's still morning where you are, and you are in charge of a $1 billion investment  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:28):**  fund.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:29):**  So you have all the flexibility, meaning you can choose the time horizon you want it back,  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:34):**  but it has to come back.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:35):**  It's an investment.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:36):**  You might lose some, which obviously is fine.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:38):**  We hope not.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:39):**  But what would you...  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:40):**  I ask this question because I want to know what people would focus on.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:44):**  What would they invest in?  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:45):**  What is underrepresented, neglected in this space that other people, because I love to  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:49):**  ask it to experts in their field, that say, but actually I would love to focus on XYZ  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:54):**  because that's what nobody's doing and it's super important.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:43:56):**  In this case, what would you invest this $1 billion into?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:00):**  I'd want to try to develop demonstration farms in every part of the world, as many as we  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:08):**  possibly can.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:10):**  And we know that when we develop these demo farms, they're going to make money.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:16):**  And so with that one time billion dollar input into the system and we could set up...  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:23):**  How would they make money?  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:24):**  What would be the model for the farm, for the demo farm?  
**[0:44:27-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:27):**  When you start making the compost, it's very easy to make excess and you start selling  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:34):**  that.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:35):**  And where we have farms out there that are already doing this, when they first get started,  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:42):**  the reputation of compost is so bad because it's the reduced waste people that have been  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:47):**  calling the yuck that they produce compost.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:51):**  And it's stinky, it's smelly, it's black, it'll kill your plants, it's just chock full  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:56):**  of pathogens.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:44:57):**  That is not compost.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:00):**  So when we first start out, people have this bad opinion of compost, so we're only going  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:05):**  to be selling that for $75 per cubic yard.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:09):**  But pretty soon the reputation gets out into the neighborhood of, yeah, buy their compost  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:15):**  because I increased my yields by 50%.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:20):**  Can you believe that?  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:21):**  They only promised 20%, but I got...  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:25):**  It starts spreading.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:27):**  And so word of mouth over the backyard fence, how come I didn't see you down at the fertilizer  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:33):**  store buying your fertilizer for this year?  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:36):**  Because I got this little bit of compost and I spread it out and I don't have to keep putting  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:40):**  it on.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:41):**  So the word gets out.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:43):**  So like with the folks up in Northern California, they started out selling their product for  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:49):**  $75 per cubic yard and pretty soon they were completely sold out.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:54):**  So as they made their next batches, they upped the price.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:45:58):**  So then it got to $150 and then $300 and then $600.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:03):**  And right now they're selling their compost for $750 per cubic yard.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:10):**  Wow.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:11):**  10 times basically from when they started.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:13):**  10 times, right.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:14):**  And they still have a waiting list of people wanting to buy their compost.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:19):**  They constantly run out even though they're expanding significantly.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:26):**  But teaching the people in that area, we've made it really clear to them that they don't  
**[0:46:31-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:31):**  accept the compost if they can't show that the organisms that they need are present in  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:40):**  that compost.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:41):**  That's the consumer's way of determining whether this compost is worth paying $75 for.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:49):**  But stuff coming out of the reduced waste municipal composting operations typically isn't  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:46:55):**  even worth 75 cents a cubic yard.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:00):**  So we've got to have this way of proving to everybody.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:04):**  There's an opportunity there.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:06):**  And regional ones.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:07):**  I mean, that's like you said, as many places as possible.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:10):**  So we're not trucking around or shipping around large quantities of stuff.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:15):**  But because the organisms that live in Northern California are inappropriate for Arizona.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:23):**  Those organisms from Northern California are used to be conditions that are nice and wet  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:30):**  in the springtime that are cool.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:32):**  They don't have the heat until later on in the summer as opposed to Arizona where the  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:39):**  rains come in October.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:41):**  They have to be appropriate.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:44):**  So we've set up bio regions and you really shouldn't be buying compost from outside your  
**[0:47:51-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:51):**  bio region.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:53):**  So how do you know if the organisms in the compost that you're buying are the ones that  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:47:58):**  work in your conditions?  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:01):**  You buy locally.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:03):**  So we want lots and lots and lots of farms.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:06):**  Every county ought to have its bio complete compost facility.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:14):**  So their starting materials are all from the local area with the local organisms on it.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:21):**  And all the proper conditions are maintained during that composting process so that you're  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:26):**  selecting for just the beneficials and not the bad guys.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:31):**  So that's kind of our intellectual property.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:34):**  I've gone over all over the world.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:36):**  There is no continent on this planet that I have not been on except for the Antarctic  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:43):**  now and Greenland.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:44):**  I guess I haven't been there either if you count that a continent.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:47):**  But otherwise every place we grow plants.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:49):**  The name suggests that we could do something there but I don't know if we want to in terms  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:53):**  of climate change.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:55):**  I think they were referring to the green and algae.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:48:59):**  That's what they grow in Greenland.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:02):**  So you would invest in demo farms but demo as in composting local bio regional high quality  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:11):**  useful appropriate compost made on farms sold to other, sold to the neighboring, sold to  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:17):**  the area.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:18):**  That's one aspect of what they're doing.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:21):**  But then they're also making liquid forms of that compost and applying it on that farm.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:30):**  So we would have as many example plant plots like here's the corn field.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:37):**  So we've got 10 acres of corn.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:40):**  And we will keep corn there for now until forever.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:45):**  When you're replenishing the biology by bringing in that really good bio complete compost,  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:52):**  there is no need to rotate your crops.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:49:56):**  Sorry but the organic world did not understand biology in the soils.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:02):**  So they got it wrong.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:04):**  If you get the right biology in there, there's absolutely no reason to rotate to a different  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:10):**  crop.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:11):**  Grow your cash crop because every year we're putting in all those organisms that are going  
**[0:50:16-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:16):**  to prevent any of the diseases of being able to attack your crop.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:23):**  If you've got all the organisms in there, then you don't have to keep adding every year,  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:26):**  but check it.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:27):**  Make sure you do have the biology.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:30):**  Just so I got it correct, you are saying and actually answering a question I usually ask  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:34):**  at the end.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:35):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative or biological agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:40):**  And you're saying rotation isn't necessary if you have the right life in your soil appropriate  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:45):**  to the crop you're growing.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:47):**  Yep.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:48):**  Absolutely no reason.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:50):**  Disease factors is one reason for why you have to rotate.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:54):**  And so if you've got a lot of diseases happening, it's kind of like mother nature trying to  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:50:58):**  tell you that you don't have your food web in place yet.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:02):**  You don't have the microorganisms present in your soil.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:06):**  So get busy and fix that so you don't have to do a rotation.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:10):**  The other thing that we're told we have to rotate is because your plant sucks all of  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:16):**  one kind of nutrient out of the soil.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:20):**  And now there isn't enough of that kind of nutrient.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:23):**  Well go back to my explanation of how nutrient cycling actually works in soil and you see  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:30):**  just how ridiculous that argument for rotation is.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:35):**  Because they're there for that corn crop and they should be there the year after when you're  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:39):**  growing that corn.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:40):**  Your plant is going to put out the food, the exudate from the plant that tells those bacteria  
**[0:51:46-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:46):**  and fungi that do the job of pulling the one nutrient that your plant requires or maybe  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:51:54):**  the 10 nutrients out of the sand, the silt, the clay, the rocks, the pebbles, your parent  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:00):**  material and oh yeah, organic matter too.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:03):**  So there is no way in a good healthy soil that you don't have all the nutrients.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:08):**  It always kind of drives me crazy when somebody says, well, but you don't have enough nutrients  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:14):**  in your soil to support the growth of your plant.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:18):**  Well how much is your organic matter in the soil?  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:20):**  If you're over 3% organic matter, you've got all the nutrients your crop of anything should  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:27):**  require just if the only thing your plants had was organic matter, they've got more than  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:32):**  enough of that nutrient, whatever it is.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:35):**  Because how could that organic matter have lived, grown, reproduced if it didn't have  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:41):**  all the nutrients that plants require?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:45):**  So the nutrients are there.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:46):**  You've just got to get the bacteria and fungi to do their job, the protozoa and nematodes  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:51):**  to do their job and your plant has every single nutrient it needs in the proper balance.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:56):**  I think a few people are going to be shocked at this piece, which is great because that's  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:52:59):**  why we're asking the questions because it's such a crucial part, such a part of that little  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:04):**  list of the principles of regenerative agriculture a lot of people refer to, but it's very interesting  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:09):**  to hear the many examples, actually the explanation of why that shouldn't be the case.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:15):**  So we want to have farms that we are working on.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:19):**  We want farms that are going to be operating for decades, for a thousand years.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:27):**  So we can show people that you shouldn't put on inorganic fertilizers because you're going  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:33):**  to kill the organisms that do the work you want done.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:38):**  If you kill those organisms, then you have to do their work and human beings are abysmally  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:44):**  bad at figuring out what nutrient your plant needs right now.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:49):**  So think of all your plants.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:50):**  Yeah, we don't have a good reputation on that.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:53):**  Not at all.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:53:55):**  When you think about how fast that cycling goes in the soil, and most people just have  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:00):**  no grasp at how rapidly this is all happening down in the soil, the nutrient that was limiting  
**[0:54:05-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:05):**  the growth of your plant at an hour ago is no longer the nutrient that should be limiting  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:12):**  your plant right now.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:14):**  Within less than about 15 minutes, your plant wants to get all of whatever nutrient is lacking,  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:21):**  and now it's going to tell those bacteria and fungi to go start on something else because  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:26):**  this is the nutrient that's limiting your plant's growth.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:30):**  It needs to be on time, otherwise I'm no longer hungry for that specific pizza.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:35):**  So the system should be responding on time.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:38):**  Yeah, your plant should have gotten all of that nutrient that it needs.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:43):**  So now it can go on to the next one.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:45):**  And it's like, how much into the future do plants look?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:49):**  Here's an interesting question.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:51):**  Oh, I'm running out of zinc over here.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:55):**  I'm running out of coal.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:56):**  How much do they plan?  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:58):**  How fast?  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:54:59):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:00):**  I think there's so much.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:02):**  It's funny that we say how much plan and think, which is language that maybe 10 years ago,  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:07):**  nobody would have used in terms of plants, but we're now getting comfortable with in  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:10):**  certain circles.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:11):**  I'm not saying everywhere.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:13):**  Looking at time, I want to be conscious of yours as well.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:15):**  And I want to end with a final question.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:18):**  What would be one thing?  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:19):**  So we take away, unfortunately, no longer in charge of the big investment fund, but  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:23):**  you have a magic power.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:25):**  You can change one thing in agriculture and food.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:27):**  What would that be with waving your magic wand?  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:30):**  What would you change tomorrow morning, this morning, today, now, whatever you prefer?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:35):**  And for me, it's probably education.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:37):**  If I could wave my magic wand and have this knowledge about the soil food web transferred  
**[0:55:43-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:43):**  into everybody's mind.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:45):**  So everyone understood this.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:48):**  And that's really my goal, probably impossible to reach in a single lifetime.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:55:54):**  But it's my goal to try to train everybody on the planet about biology in the soil and  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:00):**  how they make it work for them.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:02):**  So they can grow the most productive, healthiest plants that will feed human beings all of  
**[0:56:09-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:09):**  the nutrients that the human beings need.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:12):**  And where people understand that the outside surfaces of every bit of that plant needs  
**[0:56:18-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:18):**  to have the organisms that will benefit your human gut microbiome.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:25):**  We need to be replenishing that.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:27):**  So we're back to the doctor.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:29):**  There is seed.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:30):**  Here's the connection.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:31):**  We've gone full circle.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:32):**  There was the seed planted there for a while.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:34):**  And I think the food medicine, food as medicine, the healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:40):**  gut system, healthy people, and then healthy ecosystem, which is a circle, is one of the  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:45):**  most exciting pieces I think we've maybe ever come across, but at least in our lifetimes.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:51):**  And we're going to see a lot of that.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:52):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:54):**  And thank you so much for your time, for explaining.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:57):**  We're going to share a lot of links.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:56:58):**  You can definitely go one more.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:00):**  We're going to share a lot of links below in the show notes.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:03):**  And please tell me what you want to add.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:06):**  It's, when you think about the chemical world and they're developing these inocula of one  
**[0:57:12-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:12):**  or two bacteria that you spend thousands of dollars to put out, it's kind of exactly like  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:20):**  all these pills that you're supposed to take with one or two kinds of bacteria that's supposed  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:25):**  to replenish all your gut microbiome.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:28):**  That's pure, almost pure nonsense.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:31):**  Yes, if you don't actually have those two or three species in your digestive system,  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:35):**  you should only have to take one pill to reestablish it.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:39):**  And yet we get put on these, you've got to take one every day for the rest of your life.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:47):**  That's not what you should be doing.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:49):**  It's not a coincidence.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:50):**  They're often the same company.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:53):**  The medicine and the input company selling to the farmer are often very close or even  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:57:58):**  the same, which I think shows us their worldview, their way of their business models, a way  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:03):**  of approaching life and should make us very, very, I think, very wary about it.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:09):**  How do you avoid?  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:10):**  Well, take a look at who's actually making the pill, who's actually doing that work.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:16):**  And you should be able to take one or two bites out of a really healthy, good piece  
**[0:58:21-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:21):**  of fruit or leafy green vegetables and replenish all the gut microbiome organisms that you're  
**[0:58:30-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:30):**  missing.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:31):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:32):**  Eat healthy food and you're going to get all those organisms as an additional benefit.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:39):**  So yeah, I did want to mention that we have a lot of success stories and we're constantly  
**[0:58:45-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:45):**  building the success stories on the website, soilfoodweb.com.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:51):**  So if you're interested.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:53):**  So I will definitely link everything below to make sure it's easily findable.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:58:57):**  And I want to thank you so much for diving into us, showing us and taking us on a tour  
**[0:59:03-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:03):**  deep down into the soil and also answering a number of questions on investing, which  
**[0:59:07-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:07):**  are not normally part of your courses, et cetera.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:10):**  But that's why I'm interested in your answers, because you're such an expert on this topic.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:14):**  Well, thank you for having me on the interview.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:18):**  I enjoyed them.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:19):**  We had a lot of fun.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:21):**  And remember, we only covered the very tiniest tip of this iceberg.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:26):**  We just scratched the surface, which I usually have the feeling in the interviews that we  
**[0:59:30-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:30):**  get an hour in and we could spend another four.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:32):**  But that means we can come back and record another one, which is the beauty of the of  
**[0:59:36-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:36):**  the Internet and the podcast world.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:38):**  Yep, exactly.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:39):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:40):**  Thank you, Con.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:41):**  If you found the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast valuable, there  
**[0:59:45-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:45):**  are a few simple ways you can use to support it.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=0:59:47):**  Number one, rate and review the podcast on your podcast app.

**[1:02:21-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:21):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[1:02:36-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:36):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:38):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:02:43-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:43):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:47):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:52):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:02:53-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:53):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:55):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:02:57):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:03:01):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/04/elaine-ingham#t=1:03:03):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

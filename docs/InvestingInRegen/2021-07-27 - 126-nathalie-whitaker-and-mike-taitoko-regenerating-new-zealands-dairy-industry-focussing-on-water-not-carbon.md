### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 17:00:00)
## 126 Nathalie Whitaker and Mike Taitoko, regenerating New Zealandâ€™s dairy industry focussing on water not carbon  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:00):**  New Zealand's dairy industry has intensified tremendously over the last 20 years and has  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:05):**  to change if it doesn't want to lose its social license to operate.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:09):**  Consumers and governments are putting enormous pressure to clean up the heavily polluted  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:12):**  waterways, restore biodiversity and store a lot of carbon.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:16):**  But how and what role does data play and why should we start with water and not with carbon?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:24):**  Tempering climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:28):**  of nutrient-dense food.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:29):**  The promises of Regen-ac often sound straight out of a science fiction book.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:34):**  And for these promises to be met, we need to significantly scale regeneration to a landscape  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:40):**  scale within this decade.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:42):**  Welcome to a new series where we look into the technologies needed to bring regeneration  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:47):**  to a landscape scale.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:48):**  In this series, we'll look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:53):**  mechanisms etc. that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:00:58):**  Technologies which put significantly more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:01):**  and land stewards who are regenerating their and our soils so they can go faster.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:07):**  And we'll ask the question, what is missing?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:09):**  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:13):**  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust,

**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome to another episode today with two of the three co-founders of Toha and Come  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:01:57):**  the Farm, which is accelerating the global transition to regenerative agriculture starting  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:01):**  in New Zealand.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:02):**  So welcome, Mike and Natalie.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:04):**  Kia ora, Colin.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:05):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:06):**  Kia ora, Colin.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:08):**  And starting with a personal question, how did you end up in soil?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:12):**  Obviously both of you, but let's start with Mike.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:13):**  And how did you end up working on regenerative agriculture, the investment realm around it  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:18):**  and transitioning or trying to transition the agriculture system of New Zealand to start  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:22):**  with?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:23):**  Thanks, Colin.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:24):**  Nat and I both had windy routes to get to where we are with being right in the middle  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:29):**  of the Regen-Ag movement today in Aotearoa, New Zealand.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:33):**  For me, my pathway was really coming out of the engineering space and then to ended up  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:41):**  at Deloitte as running the strategy work there in Wellington.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:46):**  And I left Deloitte to set up my own consulting company, which became a consulting and law  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:51):**  firm, ran that for a few years.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:54):**  And during that time, we got involved in setting up building digital platforms to be able to  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:02:59):**  pull data from government and regional councils and authorities, regulators and industry.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:05):**  And one of the areas we found ourselves working quite heavily and was looking at things like  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:09):**  land use and land impacts on freshwater, freshwater quality, amongst other things, including things  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:15):**  like population health.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:17):**  During that journey, we got involved working with the Ministry for the Environment, trying  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:23):**  to look at how the dairy industry in New Zealand can move to a lighter environmental footprint.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:29):**  What are the barriers and what are the opportunities, what are the risks?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:33):**  And there was a huge learning curve for us.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:35):**  And I think the Ministry, we saw a dairy sector that was under huge stress, high intensive,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:40):**  high production, business model, and under huge pressure socially from communities and  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:47):**  from politicians and all sorts of different angles, really, the industry was under attack  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:03:55):**  and many farmers felt like they were losing or had lost their social license to operate.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:01):**  During that work, we got introduced to farmers that were carrying out regenerative and biological  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:06):**  farming practices.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:08):**  And we got to see the difference was night and day.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:12):**  We saw stress, we saw depression and anxiety, worry about the future of agriculture being  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:18):**  put into the emission trading scheme here, growing compliance costs for farmers for freshwater  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:24):**  impacts from overuse of nitrogen, all sorts of things.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:29):**  But then we're standing in paddocks with farmers who are carrying out these biological and  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:32):**  regenerative practices.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:34):**  And we saw joy, we saw profitability back again, we saw succession plans starting to  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:42):**  take care of themselves because now the kids want to stay on the farm and be the fifth  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:45):**  generation farmer versus the children coming through the intensive conventional model.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:52):**  I mean, we all know it's a major problem globally is succession.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:55):**  So that was the real illuminating piece for me.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:04:59):**  At the same time I got introduced to Natalie, the digital platform I had, my team had been  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:05):**  working on and we built that to demonstrate and prove impact.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:11):**  Where are the most impactful investments, investment decisions, activities, projects  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:17):**  and initiatives?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:18):**  Where are they and how do we turn the curve on some of our biggest environmental and climate  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:21):**  related issues?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:23):**  What I didn't have at that point, whilst we could start to see and show and prove impact  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:28):**  and demonstrate what good looks like, we had no way of funding that because now we're relying  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:33):**  on industry and government and others to fund the change.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:37):**  And we all know how challenging that is, which is what gets us into the financial piece of  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:41):**  this whole journey.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:42):**  And that's when I got introduced to Nat.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:45):**  Nat's one of New Zealand's leading experts in the field of crowdfunding.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:50):**  She built New Zealand's largest crowdfunding platform called Give a Little amongst a number  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:05:56):**  of other platforms and Nat will talk about that.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:00):**  But by bringing our kind of tech background and our careers together, we can start to  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:06):**  see, ask ourselves questions.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:09):**  If we can see and prove what good looks like with regard, particularly with regard to climate  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:14):**  and environment, then maybe we can start to unlock some of the capital that the world's  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:18):**  awash with, particularly around ESG and sustainability and now regenerative, kind of the growth of  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:25):**  the idea of regenerative economics and financial models.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:29):**  Then maybe there's something in there for us to have a serious look at.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:32):**  That was three years ago and the last three years has been the best three years of my  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:35):**  journey.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:36):**  It's just been amazing.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:37):**  Innovation, designs, huge pressure.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:41):**  We've got amazing investors backing us and that got us to soil.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:46):**  And I've said, found myself saying on a number of occasions recently that I think this is  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:52):**  me for the rest of my life.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:06:54):**  I love it and it's a big, we think it's a big important job to help to support the role  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:01):**  that agriculture must play in addressing the huge climate challenge and crisis we have  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:08):**  on our store steps right now and the urgency around that.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:12):**  Unlocking the financial and capital markets and other forms of funding are going to be  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:17):**  critical if we're going to speed this thing up.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:19):**  Thank you so much for that, Mike.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:20):**  So much to unpack there, but let's go to Natalie before we unpack a lot of that.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:24):**  How did you come from crowdfunding to soil?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:27):**  I guess the crowdfunding piece for me was a real gift, but also a bit of a curse.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:32):**  Having built New Zealand's largest crowdfunding platform, the kind of the GoFundMe for New  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:39):**  Zealand, it meant that I had visibility to a lot of the things that actually go wrong  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:44):**  in the New Zealand market and where people have to go and ask for help when they've run  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:50):**  out of options.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:52):**  And I think after eight years of running that platform and seeing all the data about everything  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:07:56):**  that goes wrong, I became obsessed with getting back to root causes and solving things before  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:03):**  they go bad.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:04):**  And so for me, that pretty much led me all the way back from social problems to environmental  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:09):**  challenges to trees.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:12):**  And then Mike convinced me to look at soil and I realized that actually this pretty much  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:17):**  comes all the way back to soil if we want to solve all of our problems, we have to start  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:21):**  at the soil.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:22):**  I think it's very interesting.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:23):**  I don't know who wants to talk about that, but to paint a bit of the picture, I mean,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:27):**  Mike highlighted some of that with this, the work on water, but of the current agriculture  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:31):**  industry in the current state in New Zealand, for anybody that doesn't live there, I think  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:36):**  we get a very pretty picture ranging from the images we see on TV or in the promotion  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:42):**  material.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:43):**  But as you already highlighted, there's enormous pressure losing social licenses, especially  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:47):**  around water, if I understand well.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:49):**  So in a nutshell, what's the current state of, especially the dairy industry, and why  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:53):**  is it such a perfect storm for the general agriculture?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:08:56):**  Yeah, I mean, that's a huge and a great question, Colin, in New Zealand.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:01):**  We do have this clean green image mostly around the world, but you don't have to dig very  
**[0:09:06-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:06):**  deep on social and to see that New Zealand has some pretty serious challenges with regard  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:15):**  to freshwater quality, the nutrification of our lakes and rivers has meant that we have  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:20):**  a very high percentage, around 70% and over.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:24):**  Our rivers are at risk of swimming in, and some are unswimmable at certain times of the  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:29):**  year.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:30):**  Some of our lakes, the signs go up, we can't swim in them due to the toxicity and the algal  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:36):**  blooms within the waterways and water bodies.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:41):**  And as it became more intensified over the last 20 years, as the amount of nitrogen and  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:47):**  phosphorus and other synthetics and chemicals started being applied to the farms, those  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:52):**  were obviously like a lot of places around the world finding their way into the waterways.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:09:57):**  You can really see that because you have following, especially with the technology you've built,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:01):**  like you could see that the last 20 years, that water quality, the watershed's basically  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:06):**  going tipping downwards in terms of quality in life?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:09):**  Totally.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:10):**  I don't know if we get to the bottom of this stat, but I saw something recently that said  
**[0:10:13-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:13):**  that we've had a 650% increase in synthetic nitrogen use since 1995 in New Zealand.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:22):**  So the intensification has been very serious and the impacts are now seen in our environment.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:28):**  And do you see water as then being, I wouldn't say a bigger issue, but maybe a more tangible  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:32):**  issue than carbon?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:34):**  As the carbon markets are taking off and people are talking a lot about it, but I always feel  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:37):**  maybe water is closer or there is more happening there or more potential.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:42):**  Totally.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:43):**  Colin, we've chosen to, I mean, we all know what the markets are doing with regard to  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:48):**  carbon and why there's such a strong emphasis on that, rightly or wrongly.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:10:53):**  We're baselining soil organic carbon, we're baselining a whole bunch of things on farms,  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:00):**  but we've chosen to focus on water for a lot of reasons.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:04):**  Our science team at Toha has been working on this, looking at soil moisture content,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:11):**  a whole lot of areas around irrigation or non-irrigation.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:17):**  New Zealand has a hugely diverse geology and for the size of our footprint, we've got probably  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:27):**  one of the most diverse landscapes in the world.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:30):**  So it means we can test and see what's going on across these different geological and topographical  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:36):**  footprints.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:41):**  We've got a huge amount of water bodies and lakes within the country, obviously, that's  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:46):**  surrounded or is in real close proximity to a lot of our most intensive agriculture sectors.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:53):**  Dairy is the industry in New Zealand that's created the biggest challenge, mostly because  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:11:59):**  of the intensification of the dairy sector.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:02):**  And so we can see the data that our regulators and regional councils have been collecting  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:07):**  over 20 years, you can actually see the decline in the regions where we've had the highest  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:12):**  intensification of dairy farming.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:13):**  So it's really easy to see what the cause and effect are.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:18):**  It's not so easy to work out how to slow that down.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:21):**  I think the other thing that's great about focusing on water and there are benefits for  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:26):**  carbon is that we know that this climate challenge is going to take cooperation, it's going to  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:32):**  take everybody doing their bit.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:34):**  But when you talk about carbon, it's really hard to kind of get that tangibly how everybody  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:39):**  needs to contribute and do something.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:42):**  With water, it's a lot more physical because you're talking about waterways where many,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:48):**  many farms border a single waterway, or you're talking about a watershed or a catchment.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:53):**  And the need for cooperation is so physical and tangible.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:12:58):**  And so I think that whole idea of placing water at the heart of what we're doing has  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:02):**  really helped us zero in, particularly from a technology perspective, on just how important  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:07):**  the mechanics are for incentivizing cooperation.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:11):**  The other piece to that too, Cohen, is that in designing out the financial infrastructure  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:17):**  where we need to get the scaled finance down to the frontline, we've chosen to start at  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:22):**  the frontline first.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:23):**  We need to understand as deeply as we can the psychology of the farmer, what the farm  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:29):**  environment looks like, what the sector is that the farmer is operating in.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:33):**  If we understand that, then we start to understand what the critical success factors are that  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:38):**  are going to lead that farmer and those farms, whether it's a fifth generation family farm  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:42):**  or a corporate farm, to start to take action in a way that's going to lead to a lighter  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:46):**  environmental and climate footprint, but at the same time, at least be more profitable  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:52):**  if not as profitable as what they were when they started.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:55):**  So understanding that psychology has been really important for us.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:13:59):**  And then we can start to build up from there.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:02):**  So let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:03):**  What is the technology piece of Toha?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:06):**  And then, I mean, it's clear why you chose Regenative Agriculture, but it still would  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:10):**  be good to dive a bit into that and unpack why it's such a perfect fit in New Zealand  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:14):**  and RegenAg for the technology piece that you have been building over the last years.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:19):**  I think for us, this comes down to trust, and we wanted to build a platform that helped  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:23):**  everybody lean back in, in situations where everybody throws their hands up in the air  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:28):**  and says, it's not my problem.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:31):**  We wanted to build a platform that was centered almost 100% around trust.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:35):**  So for us, the technology starts with this concept of a pledge, a contract, a commitment.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:42):**  We don't, I guess it is a few hundreds of years ago that we actually used to talk about,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:49):**  you know, giving an oath, giving your word, saying, doing what you say you're going to  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:55):**  do and being trustworthy.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:14:59):**  And so for us, we put this pledge, this contract, commitment to take action to reduce your impacts  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:07):**  on the environment, to make a transition to Regenerative Agriculture at the sort of start  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:13):**  of the technology.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:16):**  And then for us, the data piece is the really important bit because it allows us to take  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:22):**  measurement data that proves that you are doing what you said you'd do and that that  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:28):**  change is having the impact that everybody hopes that you'll have and...  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:34):**  Sort of enforce trust.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:35):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:36):**  But verify.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:38):**  And that's what we think is really important and needed right now is this idea that we  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:43):**  can come back to the table, we can cooperate and we can trust one another to do what's  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:48):**  needed to actually build back out of these challenges that we have.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:52):**  So how does it work practically?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:54):**  Let's say I'm a farmer in one of the catchment areas you're working in or you're looking  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:15:57):**  at or, and I really want to take a pledge of starting at least a transition towards  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:03):**  applying more regenerative practices, what would a concrete pledge look like and what  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:08):**  would it mean for me in next season or this season to take the first steps in terms of  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:13):**  support because we all know the first steps are the most difficult ones.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:17):**  So just kind of following on from what I was saying before about understanding the behavior  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:20):**  of the farmer and tying this question into the last one around carbon.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:24):**  If we ask ourselves, in order for a farmer to succeed day in, day out, they get up at  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:29):**  four o'clock in the morning, they look outside.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:32):**  It's not carbon they're looking for, it's water.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:34):**  And so hence why we're saying, well, if we know what water is, what that looks like on  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:40):**  the farm, what it means to the farmer, what it means to success, then that's our starting  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:44):**  point for the things that we need to start measuring and monitoring.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:48):**  Carbon is almost not a byproduct of that, but the relationship's critical as you know.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:53):**  So we'll measure that secondarily.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:55):**  And water is much more certain, right?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:16:57):**  Water is much more easy, at least runoff is easy to measure, chemical use is relatively  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:02):**  easy to measure, and then it's much more concrete and we've been doing it for much longer compared  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:07):**  to carbon.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:08):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:09):**  So we know what the inputs are, we know what that looks like, volumes and where they're  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:13):**  going.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:14):**  So farmers are collecting that data every day and putting sensors in the rivers now.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:18):**  I mean, attribution's still not perfect, but we can still get a really good view on what  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:23):**  the impacts of inputs and the farming practices look like.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:27):**  So what a pledge looks like, and remember we're focusing on dairy in the first instance,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:31):**  we do have some sheep and beef farms in play at the moment, but we've been focusing all  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:36):**  of our work and research and design around dairy.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:40):**  So we've had some of our team out working with dairy farmers, writing pledges, getting  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:44):**  the pledge finance up and running.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:46):**  So what a pledge looks like to get started is we want to know three or four key things  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:50):**  at a high level.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:52):**  We want to know that in order...  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:53):**  And these are based on our research around what a successful transition looks like within  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:57):**  year one.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:17:58):**  So we've got farmers we call pathfinders that we've been working with, dairy farmers who  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:02):**  have been in the transition program for anywhere between two years and seven years, eight years.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:10):**  So we've been collecting the data across those transitions, focusing on things like animal  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:15):**  health and wellbeing, the species, the plant species that have been put into the pastures,  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:22):**  milk solids, how much milk is being produced, and also the financials.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:28):**  And so we've got a really good line of sight across that.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:30):**  So when we look at the measures of success for dairy farming in New Zealand, we know  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:34):**  that when you go from a monocultural system from say ryegrass and clovers up to a more  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:42):**  diverse system of anything from nine to 30 different types of plant species, straight  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:50):**  away we know that by going to that mixed multi-species pasture, the biodiversity just in the plants  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:18:58):**  alone is enough to kickstart the biodiversity that occurs below the ground on the soil,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:02):**  but above the ground with insects and birdlife and everything starts to come back to life  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:06):**  again.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:07):**  Which is something I can do in the first year, basically.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:10):**  Changing my cover crop mix is, I wouldn't say easy and might be expensive because it  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:14):**  depends on how many hectares or acres I manage, but it is something I don't need to wait for  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:17):**  the tree to grow.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:18):**  That's right.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:19):**  And it is more expensive than just planting, continuing to plant your monocultural, you  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:23):**  know, put those seeds down every year, two years, three years, whatever it looks like.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:28):**  But in this process, remember, we're dropping out all the synthetic and chemical inputs  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:33):**  right at the start.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:34):**  And so you kind of offset some of those costs, some costs with other new ones.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:39):**  So we want to see the diversity of those plant species going.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:43):**  And the farmers, I mean, that's part of the change program.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:45):**  They sign up for that really easily.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:46):**  They just want to know what types of seeds they need to get down.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:49):**  And that might vary a little bit, but mostly it's reasonably generic across the system.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:54):**  We want to see that the stock rotation rates grow.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:19:56):**  I mean, typically you'll see anything between 12 days and 25 days before the cows are allowed  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:02):**  back in the same paddock again.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:04):**  We've got to go to at least 30 days before the cows are allowed back in that paddock  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:07):**  again.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:08):**  So at least a 30-day minimum stock rotation rate.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:12):**  If you can get up to 40 or 50, which some farmers are doing that reasonably well now,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:18):**  we know that those pastures are going to get the chance to bounce back and the biological  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:23):**  process, nature is going to really kick in and do its thing.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:27):**  And so those are two really key indicators that we look at for the pledges to get started.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:34):**  The other one is to get the synthetic nitrogen start to back that down.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:37):**  We don't specify what that needs to drop to.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:40):**  We just need the data to be provided to show that it's dropping.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:44):**  We can say now that best practice is to get it to zero and you can do that pretty quickly.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:48):**  You might need to apply a bit of urea every now and then if you need to do a bit of, I  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:52):**  think you need to do a bit of catch up.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:54):**  But we're seeing farmers go through year one now starting zero nitrogen, synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:20:58):**  inputs from day one and they're doing really well.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:01):**  And we want to see a reduction in chemicals.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:04):**  And this is all geared around what are those things that these guys need to do in order  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:08):**  to get the biological function and activity and well-being and wellness back into the  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:12):**  pastures which flows almost immediately back into the animals.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:16):**  We're seeing production curves drop off slightly but then come bounce back up again within  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:22):**  the second half of the year they start to come back again, obviously adjusting for seasons.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:26):**  Do you see quality changes as well in the milk?  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:28):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:29):**  So one of the key metrics there is, I mean, in order to make the data collection part  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:34):**  as easy as possible, low cost as possible, high quality, high volume data, in order to  
**[0:21:40-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:40):**  run a low transaction cost right across and data acquisition cost across the platform,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:49):**  the easiest thing we can do is take data that's been collected every day, if not every week  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:52):**  off the farm.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:53):**  And so things like somatic cell counts and milk urea levels are collected every time  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:57):**  the milk leaves the farm.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:21:58):**  It's all automated.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:00):**  Now we can see that data.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:01):**  What we can see is that within the first three to six months, indicators like somatic cell  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:06):**  counts and milk urea levels start to drop away.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:10):**  And they drop away at about the same rate as the vet costs start to drop away.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:15):**  And so now you're starting to see these indicators of that represent what the well-being of the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:20):**  animals.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:21):**  The milk urea also represents the quality of the milk because once you get over a certain  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:25):**  level the milk company won't take or leave your milk behind, they won't pick it up.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:29):**  And so because it degrades the quality of the product.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:34):**  So we can talk about the importance of focusing on carbon because the markets want us to focus  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:40):**  on it.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:41):**  But if we're not focusing on things like the quality of the product, the well-being of  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:45):**  the animals, therefore the production, the productivity of the animals, the well-being  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:51):**  of the pastures, then we're going to miss the point for the farmers.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:22:55):**  And if we miss the point for the farmers, we're not going to get the accelerated scale  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:00):**  actions on the ground that we need in order for us to really start solving this kind of  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:05):**  crisis that we're in right now around climate.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:08):**  So the farmer makes the pledge, like I'm starting the transition, I have this amount of acres,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:13):**  this amount of heads of cattle.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:15):**  And then how does this connect to, first of all, the platform, you're collecting a lot  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:19):**  of data as you mentioned, but then how does it connect to the financial world as well?  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:23):**  Like where does the investor or investors coming into this picture?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:27):**  Well, I think that this part is really potentially how we differ from a lot of the great work  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:32):**  that we're seeing happening all over the world.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:35):**  But for us, this pledge is a data asset.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:38):**  It's a legal agreement, but it's also an asset in that it sets up the rights to reuse the  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:46):**  measurement data that's being captured on the farm.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:50):**  Once you're starting to think about data as an asset because of the value that can be  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:23:58):**  attracted from reusing the data, so whether that's to prove the benefits of what's happening  
**[0:24:06-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:06):**  on farm through to consumers or through to regulators or back into the bank who is supporting  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:16):**  or has the mortgage over the farm, you're actually in a position where the measurement  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:23):**  data is able to earn revenue, new revenue for the farmer.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:30):**  But because we are treating this pledge as an asset, we're also able to do a second thing,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:35):**  which is to offer pledge finance.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:38):**  And pledge finance is debt to help accelerate the transition, and it really has to be tailored  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:48):**  to the individual farmer's needs.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:51):**  Every farmer is different, comes into the process with different levels of existing  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:24:57):**  debt or different challenges to face in terms of their farming system.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:04):**  But pledge finance is designed to cover either the real or perceived risk of embarking on  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:12):**  the transition.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:13):**  So we often hear a lot of pushback around, or misconceptions around the shift to either  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:22):**  organics or regen as being a serious dip for a number of years.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:29):**  And whilst we have the data to prove that that isn't the case, the pledge finance is  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:35):**  really there to help give the farmer confidence to lean into those very first steps.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:42):**  And we know that particularly in dairy there, because of the intensification and the increasing  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:49):**  demand for inputs into the dairy system, that those debt levels continue to get higher and  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:56):**  higher.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:25:57):**  So providing additional debt is not something that we are really excited about, but we know  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:06):**  that there is a job for it, and it could be that it's swapping out higher cost capital  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:14):**  in the business.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:17):**  We've had a very interesting dynamic in the New Zealand market, and I don't know how unique  
**[0:26:23-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:23):**  this is to our situation, but from a banking perspective, nitrogen application rates have  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:31):**  been used in the banking system as a proxy for farm valuation in the credit assessment  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:38):**  process.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:39):**  So for very many years, you would see farmers attempt to make transitions to regenerative  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:45):**  agriculture and actually be penalized with higher interest rates by their banks.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:51):**  Just to get that straight, the higher my rate of nitrogen, the lower my cost of capital  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:57):**  until now.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:26:58):**  So basically the reduction in nitrogen and the reduction in stocking rates was seen as  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:04):**  a loss in your productive capacity, and therefore it throws out your dynamics of your P&Ls and  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:10):**  ultimately your balance sheet.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:13):**  And so when the whole industry is geared around high production, higher input, high output,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:19):**  and everyone in the supply chain, including the banks, is making money from that except  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:24):**  for the farmers nowadays, and the consumers are paying too much for food.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:29):**  Then we've got this supply chain, and we could call it a value chain, except we think there's  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:36):**  too much value destruction going on rather than accretion.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:40):**  You start to get these dynamics that attempt to hold it there.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:43):**  Well, that's not helping the farmers by any stretch.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:46):**  And so now we've been working with the banks to start to provide that data and to show  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:51):**  that the debt risk can start to come down.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:27:54):**  We can back off this idea that reducing, backing off the intensive model and taking the lid  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:02):**  off the pressure cooker, it actually strengthens the P&Ls and balance sheets in a reasonably  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:08):**  short period of time.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:10):**  Therefore, interest rates should reflect that.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:12):**  Rather than penalizing them, it should be rewarding them.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:14):**  And just to be clear, who's financing currently these pledges?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:18):**  We have a pretty interesting dynamic around finance as well.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:21):**  With our Pledge Finance product, we're able to blend different types of capital.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:25):**  So we take grants and philanthropy, apply it to certain milestones in the pledge as  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:32):**  well as debt and equity as well.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:36):**  And so what we try and do is blend the investment interest depending on who's got what objectives  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:43):**  in terms of engaging with the farmer.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:45):**  And what that does is create a package of funding for the pledge that is really get  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:51):**  around the farmer's success.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:53):**  So we've designed the Pledge Finance product to make sure that we can engage with central  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:28:59):**  and regional governments.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:01):**  There's quite significant grant funding programs that don't always necessarily show up the  
**[0:29:09-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:09):**  proof of good use of funds, and then obviously there's the debt and equity interest and the  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:18):**  value of the region transition.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:20):**  But I just wanted to pick up on what Mike was saying around the banks.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:25):**  The other thing that we have in the New Zealand market, which we think is happening earlier  
**[0:29:31-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:31):**  in New Zealand than it is in the rest of the world, and is helping us design with maybe  
**[0:29:39-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:39):**  a few extra levers, is the requirements for banks and public investment bodies in the  
**[0:29:50-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:50):**  New Zealand market to disclose publicly their climate risk in their financial offerings.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:29:59):**  And so TCFD, the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and what that means  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:07):**  is that the banks are now really interested in understanding the climate risk that sits  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:13):**  within their agricultural lending, which creates a perfect opportunity for region farmers to  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:21):**  demonstrate that they're actually able to be more climate resilient because they are  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:29):**  able to hold more moisture in the soil and protect the soils and stay greener for longer.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:35):**  So when it comes to droughts and floods, they're in a good position.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:41):**  So making sure that the pledge is able to offer the data that proves that the risk at  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:50):**  the farm level is changing is a really big part of the work that we're doing to support  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:30:56):**  the banks to have what they need, as well as the farmers to get what they need.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:02):**  On the piece you mentioned before, where basically the data becomes an asset, and you mentioned  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:06):**  a few potential clients like banks, regulators, but also consumer brands, are banks in this  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:12):**  case paying for having that data and monitoring, and thus it becomes valuable for the farmer?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:18):**  And if not, how would it work with other potential customers like a milk brand or like the end  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:23):**  user or the processor at the end of the product?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:26):**  Do you see there's their interest in having verifiable different type of milk, or is everything  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:31):**  just being blended in one big jar?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:33):**  Do you have the same issues that we see in some renewable energy project or the energy  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:37):**  sectors as a whole?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:38):**  How does that data become super valuable, but how does it actually become valuable as  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:43):**  in money flowing to the farm?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:44):**  I think this comes back to that idea of trust.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:47):**  We're building Toha basically on the belief that verifiable proof of impact is going to  
**[0:31:54-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:31:54):**  be really important in the markets globally over the next decade as everybody rushes to  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:03):**  make really big commitments, but doesn't necessarily provide proof that they're meeting them.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:09):**  And so our technology is all designed to make it really easy to track the provenance of  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:17):**  data from farm scale and then make sure it's really easy to packet it up as claims to go  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:24):**  into all of those different market opportunities that you described, whether that's premium  
**[0:32:30-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:30):**  carbon offsets or water investment products or grant programs back to regulators or back  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:41):**  to government or proving things to regulators.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:45):**  These claims or these bundles of the data from the pledge basically create verifiable  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:51):**  proof of the actions that have happened on farm.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:32:56):**  And so the technology is designed to basically attribute the value that's exchanged when  
**[0:33:02-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:02):**  those claims are purchased back to the investors and the farmers who have been working together  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:11):**  on the transition.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:13):**  And where do you see that market take off first?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:17):**  Obviously it's a bit of a guess that the next 10 years a lot of these things are going to  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:20):**  happen.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:21):**  But where do you see the most interest at the moment as you've been working on this  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:24):**  for a while?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:25):**  Where are the first bites being taken into this data model?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:29):**  Is that the banks that you just mentioned because of disclosures?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:31):**  Is it a food brand?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:33):**  What has been the most exciting moves on getting their hands on this data and thus money flowing  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:39):**  towards farmers and investors?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:40):**  I think it's definitely the two that you've highlighted.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:43):**  So it's the disclosure piece, but we also think that there's going to be an enormous  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:49):**  amount of innovation in the insurance space, which is going to create critical demand for  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:54):**  this data as well.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:33:56):**  We are very excited about the shifts we see in consumer brands.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:02):**  And we know that a lot of the big producers in New Zealand are gearing up with programs  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:07):**  within their supply chains to actually prove the value of what's happening on farms and  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:15):**  make sure that we can showcase regenerative New Zealand made products to the world.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:21):**  But we also know that the world is changing and that New Zealand as an export nation,  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:29):**  we are sending a lot of our food offshore.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:34):**  And we know that the regulatory environments for those trade arrangements are changing  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:41):**  all the time.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:42):**  And so just making sure that this data about the environmental performance of New Zealand  
**[0:34:48-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:48):**  farms is available back through those supply chains all the way to the ports of those export  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:34:56):**  markets is going to be really, really important over the next few years.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:01):**  And how significant could, I mean, this is predicting a market, which is impossible,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:05):**  but how significant are these potential flows for a farmer?  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:10):**  Is it a nice extra to have potentially, or do you see, as I'm asking the question, I'm  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:15):**  realizing we're also predict carbon prices, which is impossible, but how significant do  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:20):**  you think it could be for farmers?  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:22):**  Apart from obviously the P&L, which gets better from the practices, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:26):**  how significant could this data play in the best use of the word?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:30):**  Well, we think it's going to be sharpened two ways.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:33):**  We think the value of the data will attract new revenue streams from the reuse of that  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:39):**  data, but we also think that it's going to help in avoiding future costs as well.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:45):**  So what we can say is that when we talk to the banks in the New Zealand market, they're  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:52):**  talking about instead of penalizing farmers for removing synthetic nitrogen, we're now  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:35:57):**  talking about interest rate rebates for the farmers who can demonstrate that they're actually  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:04):**  addressing the climate risk on their farm and making themselves more resilient.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:08):**  And so you don't need to be talking about too significant interest rate rebate on a  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:15):**  really highly leveraged dairy farm for too many months before that starts to really look  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:21):**  significant in terms of the business that's operating.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:27):**  But there is a really important dynamic.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:32):**  Agriculture in New Zealand has been outside of our emissions trading scheme, and that's  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:38):**  going to be a future cost wherever that lands in terms of farmers.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:43):**  And so we think that this data that the pledge holders have is going to be really important  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:50):**  in both the emissions trading scheme and the freshwater regulations to be able to demonstrate  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:36:56):**  that regenerative farmers are not contributing as much to these problems that the regulators  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:02):**  are seeking with sticks and quite heavy handed approaches, that they're not contributing  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:09):**  to those problems.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:10):**  And hopefully they're contributing to the solution.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:12):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:13):**  And how does this connect to the larger financial?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:17):**  Because you mentioned the beginning, Mike, as well.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:19):**  There's so much money available looking for impact investments.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:22):**  ESG has come through the roof in the last year.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:26):**  And we can all ask the questions about that, obviously.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:27):**  But there's money looking for investment opportunities with not just financial benefits, but impact  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:32):**  benefits as well.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:33):**  How does that tie into how do you see foreign investors becoming active in this?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:38):**  Or how do you see large institutional investors potentially, or the crowd, obviously, very  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:43):**  important as retail investors, as myself would love to be part of things like this as well.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:46):**  How do you see this playing out over the next years as a lot of money is needed to finance  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:51):**  pledges potentially around the world?  
**[0:37:53-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:37:53):**  Well, we've been really excited to be in several kind of validation partnerships with asset  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:00):**  managers and testing these pledges out with institutional investors.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:06):**  As financial products, the pledge finance agreements that we've designed, the debt securities,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:12):**  so the pledge is a data asset, the pledge finance agreement is a debt security.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:16):**  It doesn't take too much of an imagination to imagine what many pledges refinanced as  
**[0:38:22-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:22):**  green bonds, what that looks like, or how cool it will be to be able to invest in portfolios  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:31):**  where a big slice of your investment is going into direct farm investments.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:40):**  We've just got to do the really important work at Grassroots right now to get it really  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:47):**  easy to create and build these pledges on our technology platform, support the advisors  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:52):**  who do the really important work with farmers in the real world, giving context to this  
**[0:38:58-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:38:58):**  digital process and making sure that we are able to blend the early finance that comes  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:06):**  in, the grant and impact capital that comes in to get these transitions rolling.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:13):**  Once that's underway, then everybody's in partnership with the farmer and wants to see  
**[0:39:19-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:19):**  that refinancing or securitization event actually happen because it validates the early work  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:28):**  that is being done.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:31):**  We see a huge future for pledges, but also for claims as well.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:36):**  The other part of our platform, which is the reuse of the data, claims as options over  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:44):**  multiple reports from the system, whether that is for carbon or for water, there's going  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:51):**  to be great markets for those products too.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:39:57):**  It's all ahead of us right now, a lot to prove.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:00):**  We try not to crystal ball gaze too much, just keep our family planted on the ground  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:05):**  and just keep focused on farmers and building pledges.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:09):**  Just to get a bit of the size, it's a bit of a crystal ball, but let's say the dairy  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:13):**  industry in New Zealand, how much would be needed more or less to get most of them on  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:18):**  the journey?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:19):**  Look, there's 12,000 or so dairy farms in New Zealand, Cohen.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:24):**  Most of those farmers are brought into the high intensive, high production model.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:29):**  The psyche around that and the behaviors across the industry norms are still sticking to that,  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:35):**  but you're starting to see a shift now, both in the one end of the bell curve starting  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:40):**  to actually make the move and some have been there for a long time.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:43):**  They are now showing they can get through the transition in year one without needing  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:47):**  any additional funding.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:48):**  There's a really diverse range of needs across those farmers that are making the transition.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:54):**  Some don't need any, others need to put new infrastructure in place and might need two,  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:58):**  $300,000.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:40:59):**  We're seeing what that continuum looks like.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:03):**  At the same time, we're seeing large industry players and brands starting to say out loud  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:09):**  that they've now spent the last 12 months rewriting their strategies.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:14):**  They've got regenerative futures.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:16):**  They're talking about changing the way that they supply their producers farms so that  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:21):**  they can get their produce to market in a completely different way or type of product.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:27):**  Whilst the government's moving really slowly in this space and it's not real clear how  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:34):**  the money markets are going to respond to this just yet, although we can see what it  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:39):**  looks like in terms of the engagement we've been having at a smaller scale, it's actually  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:43):**  the middle of the industry now, some of the processes and brands that are starting to  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:47):**  put a stake in the ground.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:49):**  That's going to start driving a more accelerated shift into the dairy sector at that end of  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:54):**  the bell curve.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:41:55):**  In terms of the size of that, look, if we can get to 25% of the dairy sector within  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:01):**  the next five years, it could be seen as ambitious.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:05):**  We think that that could be conservative and what we think will change that is the success  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:10):**  of the pledge finance and the claims revenue that are generated out of this.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:15):**  Nothing will change this transition faster or more powerfully than evidence that the  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:20):**  financial upside for farmers is real through both business as usual changes and benefits  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:26):**  to the P&Ls and the additionality of the revenue streams that can flow from claims through  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:32):**  the data provided through the pledge agreement.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:38):**  We're optimistic that we can see a reasonably large scale transition as long as we can get  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:42):**  those mechanics around that right and at the moment we've got every reason to believe that  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:46):**  we can.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:47):**  And as it always feels we're early and at the same time, many have been through this  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:52):**  transition, this is a long journey and many people have been in the region, biodynamic,  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:42:58):**  organic space and the pioneers have been here for a long time but at the same time we feel  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:02):**  like we're entering a new era or a new phase.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:05):**  For investors, without giving investment advice, which we obviously don't do here, but what  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:09):**  would you tell them, where would you focus their attention when they get interested in  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:15):**  the space?  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:16):**  They're listening maybe to this podcast, they read the books, they visit some farms, they  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:20):**  saw some documentaries, what would you tell them as an entry point when they say, okay,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:24):**  I want to become active?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:25):**  Maybe they're not located in New Zealand so it's not so easy to visit you and spend some  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:28):**  time with their farms and transition, but what would be your next step if you would  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:33):**  be in their shoes?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:34):**  Yeah, awesome question, Cohen.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:35):**  I think, look, we've seen the capital stack arrive when we put it out there, what we're  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:41):**  doing, we did a soft launch, went to the media, we got picked up by a whole bunch of different  
**[0:43:47-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:47):**  publications, social, industry, government, we were kind of bombarded in a really good  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:54):**  way.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:55):**  We saw the capital stack turn up pretty quickly, but we also saw the diversity across the farmer  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:43:59):**  needs turned up pretty quickly.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:01):**  The market essentially showed itself within two or three weeks.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:04):**  And so what would I say to investors?  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:06):**  Well, now I can say, well, it depends which investor you are inside of that stack and  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:10):**  it depends what opportunity on the other side, the cost of diversity of needs there are.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:15):**  Now to work that out, if you don't know what regenerative ag, how it works, not just how  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:20):**  it works, but how it works really, really well, my advice would be go to those organizations  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:25):**  that have already put the hard work in to understand the sector and understand how,  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:31):**  where the investment needs to go to do two things.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:34):**  One, in order for the investor to get whatever the return is that they're looking for on  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:39):**  their money.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:40):**  And two, that where they're putting their money is actually going to make a positive  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:43):**  impact of contribution to the asset or the farmer or whatever it is that applying it  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:48):**  to there on the other side.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:49):**  Now, when you look at who those organizations are, you know most of them, you probably know  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:54):**  all of them.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:44:55):**  It's the Mad Ags, it's the Regen Networks, it's the Ory Co-op in Australia, it's what  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:00):**  we're trying to do.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:02):**  It's the Road Hours and Savories and Land to Market programs.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:06):**  The entities exist and those entities have the, that's replant capital, Robin O'Brien  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:12):**  and her team doing amazing stuff.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:15):**  Go there.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:17):**  They've done the heavy lifting, that's the funnel that the investment needs to go through.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:23):**  The investment's going to be much safer, at least more de-risked out the other side because  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:29):**  these guys have all done the hard work, both for the farmers but also for the investors.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:35):**  And Natalie, what do you see as a role, I don't know now, maybe it will take a bit of  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:40):**  time, but for the crowd, for the retail investors, for the normal people that are buying the  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:44):**  milk every day in the supermarket, apart from being a consumer, or maybe even becoming a  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:49):**  consumer again because they were switching to plant-based and coming back to some kind  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:52):**  of regenerative produce, but apart from being a consumer, do you see a role for the retail  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:45:58):**  investor or has it go, do we have to go first through the institutional part, the green  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:02):**  bonds, et cetera, before the normal people in the street can also participate in this?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:06):**  No, I think one of the most interesting things from my perspective last year in 2020 was  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:13):**  the GameStop carnage that we saw in the stock market.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:17):**  I think we have to really recognise that we're going to see activist retail investors looking  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:25):**  for opportunities to go right into the middle of investment opportunities that are being  
**[0:46:32-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:32):**  ignored by other investors and really starting to crowd in and bring some might and some  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:40):**  visibility to areas particularly that are neglected by government or neglected by big  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:46):**  corporates in terms of their obligations.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:50):**  And I think that that's really exciting.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:53):**  So from a retail investor perspective, I'd just be like, don't just watch the Netflix  
**[0:46:59-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:46:59):**  documentary, like, Google the names, find the organisations, get directly involved, get  
**[0:47:08-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:08):**  on the mailing lists, that every single Regen AG team like our Calm the Farm team globally  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:18):**  right now is looking for funding innovations, looking for new markets and looking to bring  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:25):**  new products.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:27):**  And they're not going to be all just for the wholesale and wholesale markets and large  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:33):**  institutional investors.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:34):**  They're going to find ways to actually bring really innovative high value investment products  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:40):**  direct to consumers.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:43):**  You just need to be looking out for them.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:45):**  And when they turn up, obviously you only ever invest what you're prepared to lose when  
**[0:47:51-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:51):**  you're playing in that game.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:47:53):**  But follow, do the head and the heart thing and you'll get great results.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:00):**  Thank you so much for that.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:01):**  And I think we're going to have, I hope to have more discussions on the retail side of  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:05):**  things.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:06):**  I keep bringing it up and up and it comes back and I think it's coming, but it does  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:09):**  feel, I have said it many times in the podcast, renewable energy space obviously has a few  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:13):**  more years under their belt.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:15):**  Not if you consider the early organics and biodynamics, but especially on the round of  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:18):**  financing they do.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:20):**  And there it is much easier in many countries, not in all, to get involved with a few hundred  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:24):**  or a few thousand dollars in euros.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:26):**  To have a few final questions to wrap this up, won't be the last time we're talking,  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:30):**  there's so much to unpack here, but where do you find yourself contrarian?  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:35):**  Where do you think differently than most other people in the region ag space?  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:38):**  Definitely inspired by a question that John Kemp always asks, but where are you contrarian?  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:42):**  And I would love to ask those of you.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:43):**  What do you see differently than most people if you go to a conference?  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:47):**  When we went to conferences before.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:49):**  I mean, I met you at a RFCFI conference a couple of years ago up in Oakland, Cohen and  
**[0:48:55-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:48:55):**  got to see then the investor space and market coming into regenerative ag setting to talk  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:04):**  about how to invest.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:06):**  And I did feel like an oddball.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:08):**  I mean, one of the reasons I was up in the US at that time was I'd said to Nat, I'm going  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:12):**  up to the US, I went to Socap, went to RFCFI.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:17):**  I was looking for the innovation and the investor space into this area.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:22):**  And I was phoning Nat every day saying, I haven't found it yet.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:25):**  I haven't found it yet.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:26):**  I saw your presentation.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:28):**  I love the kind of what you were starting to angle at, but I certainly didn't see it  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:32):**  from anyone who was speaking about this from the markets or from the bond space.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:36):**  There's some traditional mindsets talking about going into a new sector, but there wasn't  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:42):**  a traditional mindset talking about a new innovation as a financial product.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:48):**  And we kind of, I felt like a bit of a fish out of water when I was there.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:52):**  We still do.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:49:53):**  The area we want to crack is the financial markets, capital markets, moving into tokens.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:01):**  How do we bridge that gap from traditional into what the future is going to be?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:07):**  But where we differ is whilst that's almost our endpoint, our boots are on the ground  
**[0:50:14-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:14):**  as much as humanly possible every day of the week with the farmer.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:18):**  And I know there's a whole ton of region advisors and farmers out there.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:23):**  That's how they make a living.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:25):**  That's not where we come from, but man, we've spent so much time out on kitchens and with  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:30):**  farms saying we're talking to investment bankers.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:32):**  We're talking to all sorts of investors, retail bank, whatever.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:37):**  But man, we aren't budgeting until we understand as deeply as humanly possible what's going  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:41):**  to make you guys succeed and when we're not going to solve carbon if these guys aren't  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:46):**  going to be at the forefront of driving the change.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:48):**  And so that's where we found ourselves a little bit different.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:51):**  Regen network are there as well.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:50:54):**  But it's an area I think that we've spent a huge amount of effort, time and energy and  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:00):**  investment in really deeply understanding.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:04):**  And then just to round that out, what that's meant is that that's how we got to saying,  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:08):**  okay, carbon is a thing.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:09):**  We get that.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:10):**  But that's not where we're going to spend most of our time to try and understand and  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:13):**  look at what the new market opportunities need to be, which is why we landed on water.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:18):**  Personally, for me, I think the most contrarian thing that I'm confronted with personally  
**[0:51:24-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:24):**  is that I went vegan for the environment, you know, five years ago and I developed a  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:31):**  view of agriculture and of particularly of dairy.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:36):**  And I just find myself humbled every day by the enormous impact, positive impact that  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:43):**  agriculture done right can have for the future.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:48):**  And I just feel really grateful for the opportunity to be working alongside farmers because the  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:52):**  reality was that being a vegan and sitting back and passing judgment, you know, obviously  
**[0:51:58-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:51:58):**  working hard to make conscious choices in terms of how, what I was buying, but really  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:04):**  I wasn't doing anything material in terms of, you know, putting more carbon back into  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:11):**  the soil or actively planting trees or getting out there and regenerating our indigenous  
**[0:52:17-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:17):**  biodiversity.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:18):**  And so I take my hat off to farmers and I've pretty much dedicated myself to making sure  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:24):**  that they've got everything that they need to do the work that a lot of us town folk  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:28):**  can't do sitting behind our computers.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:31):**  And do you remember if it was a moment like you visited a farm, was it a gradual process  
**[0:52:35-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:35):**  where you saw the potential of agriculture beyond the judgment of if everybody goes vegan  
**[0:52:42-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:42):**  and we should, we're okay.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:44):**  And actually the truth is a bit more complex than that.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:46):**  What was that a moment of one farm visit?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:48):**  I'm always interested in these, these light bulb moments or light bulb continuum, like  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:53):**  light bulb journeys, but do you remember that or was it a longer process?  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:52:57):**  It was a longer process, but I think for me it came down to compassion, right?  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:01):**  So there's a whole lot of really difficult change that we face with climate change and  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:06):**  everybody needs to give up some things that we've got used to in order to have a chance  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:11):**  for living regeneratively on this planet again.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:14):**  But for me it was recognizing that there was more positive benefits to be had by actually  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:24):**  working with farmers than disengaging.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:28):**  So yeah, it was a tough learning and I'll probably be kicked out of a few vegan Facebook  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:38):**  groups after this podcast.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:41):**  But that's kind of where I got to personally was recognizing that yeah, there was more  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:46):**  work to be done than just fighting.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:49):**  I think it's a very interesting point.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:50):**  We had a vegan cheese maker, Willie Croft, which I'll definitely put the link below on  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:54):**  the podcast that had that realization as well when they did an LCA and noticed that the  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:53:59):**  cashew nuts they were using for their vegan cheese were definitely a step up from industrial  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:04):**  dairy, but absolutely not as clean and as environmentally friendly as they hoped they  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:08):**  would be as they were shipped around the world.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:11):**  They were dried using natural and obviously extractive fossil fuel gas.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:15):**  And so they switched their whole process to beans and to other, but it was a very painful  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:19):**  transition or very painful realization to see like we're actually not as far as we hoped  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:24):**  we would have been.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:25):**  But I think it's necessary.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:26):**  We need the whole movement here to push on ag and to pull on ag at the same time.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:31):**  And to end with a final question for both of you, but let's start with Natalie.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:34):**  If there's one thing you could change, you have a magic wand, there's one thing you can  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:37):**  change in the food and ag industry or sector or whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:42):**  What would that be?  
**[0:54:43-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:43):**  I think it would be the inability for us to get over where we've come from and the knowledge  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:52):**  that we've used in the past.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:53):**  And it's really the open mindset piece.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:54:55):**  I think we just, what I've observed over the last couple of years is we're either looking  
**[0:55:00-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:00):**  at science gaps or we're looking at problems with products and things like that.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:07):**  I think the reality is that it's time for everybody to be open to new ideas.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:12):**  And I think it's just more openness and more sharing of information.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:20):**  I would love to see more open data and more knowledge sharing, particularly within the  
**[0:55:26-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:26):**  corporate environments and less locking people out of the knowledge that they need to change  
**[0:55:34-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:34):**  quickly.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:35):**  Adding on to that, for me, it's about, I think I'd like to see much shorter supply chains  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:40):**  with friendlier capital coming into the industry.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:46):**  Every farmer we've met who's made the change to regenerative agriculture, the number one  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:49):**  driver has been to improve the economics.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:52):**  The environmental, climate and biodiversity outcomes have been important to them, but  
**[0:55:56-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:56):**  that hasn't been the primary driver.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:55:58):**  So how do we make the economics around this much more friendly?  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:02):**  By shortening that supply chain, we say to farmers now, man, looking in from the outside,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:07):**  if there's one thing you guys have got really good at, it's writing checks out for everybody  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:11):**  else in your supply chain and getting as much money off your farm as quickly as you possibly  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:15):**  can, how do we turn that around?  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:17):**  So getting a lot of that, like we talked about the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, you start  
**[0:56:23-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:23):**  to see that drop to zero.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:24):**  There's a massive cost drops out of the supply chain.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:27):**  Sure, someone in that supply chain is going to lose out ultimately, but the benefit comes  
**[0:56:31-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:31):**  back to the growers and the consumers.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:33):**  And at the end of the day, that's where all the feedback that we're getting is telling  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:37):**  us this is where we need that value to flow to.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:39):**  So that would be my magic wand moment.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:42):**  I think it's a perfect answer.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:45):**  By the time this is up, I don't know if the interview.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:47):**  I just recorded will be up already, but we're, we recorded an interview with one of the largest  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:51):**  biodynamic farms in Europe, over 2000 hectares and selling everything and always for the  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:57):**  last 40 years directly to consumers.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:56:59):**  And you can see the wealth that has created the wealth in terms of biodiversity.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:03):**  Obviously now they're profitable.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:04):**  It wasn't easy in the beginning, but, and you see the intimate relationship they have  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:08):**  great with their customers.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:09):**  And of course that's easier in wine and certain other products.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:12):**  So direct to consumer, I would say director to consumer.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:15):**  They took a very extreme route, but have been not consciously actually it was more an accident  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:19):**  at the beginning, but now definitely it's turned into one of their great strengths because  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:23):**  they own the relationship with their consumer and the consumer owns them in a certain extent  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:27):**  as well.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:28):**  Totally.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:29):**  It's a perfect end to not easy in a New Zealand context where a lot of the consumers are very  
**[0:57:33-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:33):**  far away, but also there, I think there's a transition to be made.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:36):**  So I want to thank you so much for your time today.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:39):**  Very exciting times ahead.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:40):**  I hope we'll be checking in not too far away, not in the too distant future to see how all  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nathalie-whitaker-mike-taitoko#t=0:57:45):**  the pledges are going, technology platform and a lot more work you have been doing.

### Regenerative by Design  (2022-11-25)  
### Author(s): Joni Kindwall-Moore & Liz Ward  

**[0:00:00-0:00:26](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everyone. You are listening to the Regenerative by Design podcast, where we will be getting to the root of health, climate, economics, and food.  I am your host, Joni Kinwall-Moore. I'm an RN, an ethnobotanist, and the founder of Snacktivist Foods.  Join me on this journey as we explore the ideas, stories, and personalities behind the regenerative food system movement.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:52](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:00:26):**  Food is the connection between people and planet. In a world where pandemics, climate change, and war have made us feel so disconnected and vulnerable,  regenerative agriculture has become a powerful force for positive transformation and hope.  Here, regenerative thought leaders share how agriculture and food design can create a more resilient system.  
**[0:00:52-0:01:21](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:00:52):**  Okay, welcome everybody. Thank you for joining us on the Regenerative by Design podcast. I am Joni, your host, and today we have Liz Ward from Bumble Bar and Clean Toe Pack joining us.  And we're going to talk about a topic that is really near and dear to my heart because as someone who's worked in food systems for quite some time,  I feel like the middle ground of what happens when the food leaves the field and then finds its way to your plate is the most neglected part of the food system that  
**[0:01:21-0:01:39](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:01:21):**  A. is hidden and we want to illuminate that. We want to tell the story. And B. it's where a lot of the quality is either preserved or lost.  It's all in that processing. So Liz is going to tell us about her story and welcome Liz. We're so happy to have you today.  Well Joni, I'm happy to be here. Thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:01:39-0:02:07](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:01:39):**  You're welcome. You're welcome. So you and Glenn, who is not with us today, unfortunately, because Glenn is a fantastic character and full of a lot of cool wisdom and anecdotes as well and great humor.  But you guys have had quite an incredible journey. And I'm going to just bring our listeners a little bit into the fold.  But back in the 90s, I started a little cookie company in Missoula, Montana called Kineta Cookies and they were vegan protein cookies.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:34](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:02:07):**  And we were way ahead of the curve, apparently. We should have probably stuck with it. But I ended up reaching out to Glenn and Liz back at that time and asking them about co-packing.  Because we couldn't scale without a co-packer. And Glenn and Liz had a fantastic brand called Bumble Bar and they were making bars.  And that's when I first met them. Granted, it was like we weren't like keeping in touch, but they've been on my radar like 30 years later, pretty much.  
**[0:02:34-0:03:07](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:02:34):**  So Liz, tell us about that story. Like what prompted you guys to start that? Where did you come from? How did you get together? And how did this all start?  Well, it started in the Midwest, strangely enough for both of us. Glenn and I were actually born about a couple hours away from each other back in Michigan.  And then I grew up in Michigan and Wisconsin and moved out west, as they say in the Midwest, to the Pacific Northwest when I was 18 years old.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:03:07):**  And I had never actually been out there, but I knew it was super beautiful and I knew it was more progressive.  And there were some school programs I was interested in. And within the first couple months that I was living in Seattle on Capitol Hill, I somehow came across a book on veganism.  And I had already been way into natural food ever since I went to my first co-op, The Outpost in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  
**[0:03:38-0:04:11](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:03:38):**  When I was like 13, for some reason my dad took me in there and I was just enthralled. You're like, I'm home, I'm home. I know that feeling.  Exactly. This is the promised land, right? Like I love everything about this. Yeah, totally.  So then I moved out to Seattle and I got this book on veganism, which was an eye-opener and probably turned into a pretty militant vegan for quite a while.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:57](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:04:11):**  And I love to learn. I read at least 50 books a year, usually more than that. That's impressive.  Well, thanks. I've always really loved reading. And I also really like to learn. And so in school I pretty much studied whatever struck my fancy, like economics, American Sign Language, just totally all over the place.  So I was kind of trying to figure it out. And I knew that I wanted to make some sort of positive impact because that was the way I was raised.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:39](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:04:57):**  My parents started, my mom was a social activist and had me working in the soup kitchen, which she helped found when I was like eight years old collecting tickets, perched on a little stool.  And then by the time I was 16, I was actually running it and cooking for hundreds of people every week. And I really love food and I love making food.  I love making people happy with food. And most of all, I like making healthier food that people love, right? That's delicious and they're not compromising on the flavor profile or anything like that.  
**[0:05:39-0:06:26](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:05:39):**  But just through making that choice, it has very big ripple effect. So back to wanting to make a difference with my career and kind of floating around.  I have a lot of tragedy in my background and I thought that I could leverage that into a nursing career. And I realized fairly quickly that it was way, way, way too emotional.  And I thought, you know, what makes me really happy and what makes me really super duper happy is, like I just said, healthy food, feeding people healthy food, vegetarian and vegan healthy food.  
**[0:06:26-0:07:05](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:06:26):**  So at the time, it's hard to believe, but there actually weren't any certified organic snack bars on the market. And I had these two different ideas for products.  And I guess in retrospect, they're both a little weird for the time. So one was the Bumble Bar, the sesame and flaxseed bar with nuts and rice syrup.  And my other idea was I make really good roasted soybeans, but it was before soybeans were mainstream, like soy in general was just really weird and there was not very many people eating it.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:43](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:07:05):**  So I thought, oh, I'm going to go with this sesame flax bar. And I started shopping it around to Seattle. And because it was the first certified organic bar and it was also gluten free and vegan, it was a no brainer for stores to take it in Seattle.  And then within that year, I showed up basically on my now husband's doorstep. He lived out in the woods on the Kitsap Peninsula and some friends were going over there for dinner and asked me if I wanted to go.  And we just started talking. And it's like we never stopped. Right.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:07:43):**  Yeah, decades later, still talking.  Decades later. Yeah, decades later.  Love that.  
**[0:07:50-0:08:12](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:07:50):**  98% of the time really love each other.  And run a business together and raise kids together like that's our core.  Which is a miracle. It has its pluses and its minuses. But Glenn and I are really lucky in a lot of ways. And one is that our skill sets are very complimentary.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:37](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:08:12):**  So we're definitely more of a whole, the two of us together, instead of just individually.  And so I showed up on Glenn's doorstep. We started talking. We fell in love. He was actually working in corporate America at the time.  Which, since you know Glenn, he's quirky and funny and out of the box.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:08:37):**  He's hilarious.  He is hilarious.  I enjoy him.  
**[0:08:40-0:09:04](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:08:40):**  And also his work schedule was, he had really weird bad hours.  So at any rate, he took a flyer and came over to Bumble Bar.  And we proceeded to grow the business into a top 20 bar brand through a lot of really super hard work.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:16](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:04):**  We both like to work hard. Which is good because it's the only way when you're a business owner.  Isn't that the truth? There's no shortcuts.  Labor of love.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:25](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:16):**  Labor of love and also a school of hard knocks, right?  Isn't that the truth?  I remember eating your bars and loving them.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:25):**  And in fact, I always laugh at when my first daughter was born.  The first thing you eat, you kind of remember because after having a baby, it's quite the workout, right?  It's like, oh, I climbed Everest. What did I eat when I got home?  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:38):**  Well, I had a Bumble Bar.  It was like the best thing ever.  Yeah, it was so good.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:55](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:44):**  That was back in 2006.  So yeah, it's just funny.  You don't realize the impact of your brand sometimes until you hear those funny little stories.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:10](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:09:55):**  Yeah, I love that. It's like nutrient dense and it still tastes good, right?  Yeah, that was exactly what I needed.  It's interesting because you guys have gone the route of like you've explored with co-packing and then taken it back in.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:27](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:10:10):**  Realized that you were really good at managing that middle ground and creating that culture of quality and integrity and transparency.  Which is not always easy to find out there in the co-packing world.  And I think you guys do an exceptional job at it.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:42](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:10:27):**  Thank you. We try hard. We really try hard.  Glenn also loves to learn.  And we're both, I mean, that's one of my most favorite things actually about my job is that I'm always learning and it's super rigorous.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:10:42):**  Yeah, never gets monotonous.  Really, because there's always something new being thrown at you.  Like when did you guys make the transition going, OK, we're making our bars, we're manufacturing our bars, we're doing a really good job.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:08](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:10:56):**  These people keep calling us to ask for help.  Like maybe we should consider the co-packing as like a real extension of our business aside from our business.  Like when did that happen and how did you guys work through that process?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:19](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:11:08):**  2008 is when that happened.  The recession hit and because we had always been self-funded.  We did not have the deep pockets that the large players had.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:32](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:11:19):**  And so they could deeply, deeply discount their products and we just were not in a position to do that.  And as you know, being in the grocery industry is extremely costly.  And so we had to make a pivot.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:48](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:11:32):**  And I was like, hey, how about all these people that want us to make product?  Why don't we take a flyer and say yes?  And we said yes to Hain Celestial, which is a really large natural foods brand.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:59](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:11:48):**  And it was such a gift.  It was such a gift because we were like, you know, we're a little tiny mom and pop shop here.  I don't know that you know what you're getting yourself into.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:30](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:11:59):**  But they actually wanted to work with a smaller manufacturer and specifically they really wanted to work with us because we were values aligned.  And so they sent a quality person up here and the quality person spent I don't know how long helping us build out food safety programs.  And even though we had always scored high on all of our inspections and everything, we were super unsophisticated.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:12:30):**  You know, it's super it's very complicated.  And it's what you don't know.  It's what you don't know.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:54](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:12:38):**  And there was a ton that we didn't know.  So Hain very generously taught us a whole bunch of stuff and built out a whole bunch of processes.  And we just sort of took off from there.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:14](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:12:54):**  Then, you know, the clients kept coming.  Like I another thing in my job that I really like doing is product development.  I can steer I can steer I can steer product development in ways that it might not have gone otherwise.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:13:14):**  Like sometimes maybe somebody was thinking they were going to use dairy and they're not aware of the non-dairy alternatives.  And honestly, a lot of the non-dairy proteins are tricky to formulate with, as you know.  But I've been able to steer companies into healthier and better for the planet direction.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:57](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:13:38):**  So I've made products for Pepsi and Dole and Dean and DeLuca and a whole bunch of big brands.  And that's been that's been really, really great. Really great.  I bet. Like the magic behind what most people just pick up and eat dough.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:22](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:13:57):**  Oh, this is great. But it's fun. It's so cool to see the person behind that and like how that actually came to me.  Yeah, it's really fun. I love being I love being creative and I especially love being creative with food.  So I and the people that we work with are very kind people and we're values aligned.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:14:22):**  And I think that's one big reason why people really do want to work with us because we're committed.  Well, and you don't just say it, you actually do it.  And in this day and age, there's a lot of talk about sustainability and greenwashing and, you know, all this stuff.  
**[0:14:40-0:15:02](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:14:40):**  And then you look under the hood and you're like, wow, what are you actually doing to achieve these statements that you're claiming?  And it's often not there. And, you know, so I always think it's so great to find other brands and companies that really put their walk into their talk about things.  And even if they're not doing them yet, they're building what it takes to get there. And that's a huge part of the process, too.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:18](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:15:02):**  Often that's the excuse of like, well, it's it's going to take us some time. You're like, well, then what are you doing?  Like what? What are your steps today, tomorrow and the next day to get there? And and that's all part of the process.  But when you are in manufacturing, I think what most people don't listen or most people don't realize and our listeners may not know this,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:39](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:15:18):**  is that there is a myriad of certifications and an incredible amount of administrative hurdles to jump through,  to be safety certified, to be half up certified, to be certified gluten free or certified vegan or certified organic.  And and I don't think consumers have any idea what goes into all of that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:59](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:15:39):**  I know we've been lambasted by bloggers out there before that were like, you know, well, you're not certified organic.  I wouldn't touch that. And I'm like, do you think we have the money to go be certified organic?  Like even if we are all organic ingredients, we can't afford that certification right now because we don't have the administrative internally and we don't have the cash.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:29](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:15:59):**  And I don't think consumers get that. And and I think that's why it's really important that we educate about all these steps in the middle and that transparency that comes into play.  I think you're 100 percent right, Joni. I agree with you. Another thing that consumers don't know is that organic food is by its very nature non-GMO.  You can't have a GMO containing organic in a certain in an organic product.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:54](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:16:29):**  So, yeah, I think consumers just don't know. And you're you're so right on the document control and the cost.  We spend tens of thousands of dollars on our certifications, safe quality food, kosher, gluten free.  I know I'm missing some, but it's it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money for the certification itself.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:13](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:16:54):**  But even more so what you were talking about. Yeah, the document control.  It's yeah. And the work like you have to pay somebody to do that, like or you have to take your own time.  And there's a cost associated with that. It's kind of an invisible cost that the system and the consumer side doesn't see.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:31](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:17:13):**  Like often will pitch to a retailer like my personal experience. They're like, well, we'd totally be behind this if it was certified, you know, verified non-GMO.  And it was this and that. And I'm like, yeah, but we're a startup brand. We haven't gotten there yet.  But if we get on more shelves, then we can pay for it. And they're like, well, no, we don't want you on the shelf if you don't already have it.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:46](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:17:31):**  So you have this chicken or the egg phenomenon.  And I know a lot of brands are up against the same hurdle, but I feel like sales buyers don't often understand that either.  You know, like the buyers, the decision makers, independent stores usually I feel like they do.  
**[0:17:46-0:18:07](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:17:46):**  They're like a different mindset and they appreciate the hustle. But, you know, a lot of these other people, they just kind of don't know.  I don't think they understand what goes into the middle. So much goes into it.  I mean, so, so much goes into it. Those certifications, just like adding new products to some kind of renewal takes hours and hours and hours.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:18:07):**  We recently started a new brand with some business partners and those products are certified non-GMO.  And I think there's about 20 products. We spent almost 80 hours collecting all of the documents and just executing on the certification.  And that is a lot of time. That's about where we were at to get non-GMO verified.  
**[0:18:40-0:19:05](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:18:40):**  And we have it, but we haven't ordered the new packaging. So we're paying for that certification, but we can't even tell the consumers yet.  It's like the irony. You're like, oh, and then now, like then when you start to like change up your ingredients stack, like, you know, for us,  we do have a real focus on regenerative and transitional regenerative farming and how we incentivize that path to better,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:27](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:19:05):**  which a lot of times really well done regenerative lands you inorganic because you eliminate the need for all these synthetic chemical inputs because you heal the soil.  And that even adds another complexity that we've been talking a lot to like non-GMO.  And I'm like, you guys, we need you to create a pathway that helps incentivize brands that are wanting to work directly with farmers.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:53](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:19:27):**  So that there's there's some sort of assistance getting over those hurdles instead of getting billed another five hundred dollars plus another 20 hours of paperwork to go,  hey, we're sourcing this from farmer so-and-so. Here's all their information.  We're adding it to our ingredients stack. But right now it kind of almost feels like you're almost punished for doing better work because the cost and the expense and the time that it takes to make that shift.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:20](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:19:53):**  And I think that that part holds the system hostage because it puts a huge burden on you guys because you're at the formulary level, you're managing the ingredients.  And then but then again, this is why I was like, I want to have a conversation with Liz and Glenn because you guys see it in action with many brands across the board.  We sure do. We sure do. And it's the way that I formulate is a little different than it used to be.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:20:20):**  Now I don't even bother making up samples with ingredients that aren't from approved suppliers because, you know, ingredients can really vary.  And if I'm not going to be able to qualify the supplier, my supply chain manager is not going to be able to qualify the supplier, then like no matter how great it is, like you were talking about the small farmer or whatever, it's like I just can't do it.  Because I'm not going to be able to get it through the certification. So, yeah.  
**[0:20:50-0:21:17](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:20:50):**  And that's a huge barrier in like really changing our food system to regional supply web, more connected closed loop.  It actually forces the food system to have more of a dependency on large aggregators that have all that, you know, kind of infrastructure in place.  And it's really this is what like a big part of this whole regenerative by design podcast is all about.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:35](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:21:17):**  It's like how do we kind of work through the reality, work through the constraints, and then how do we shift that to a more regenerative by design model?  Like what are the big structure things that need to change to allow that to happen?  What do you see from your perspective?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:21:35):**  Well, I love your idea about maybe you didn't say grant money, but you said some assistance from the certifiers.  Something that Biden did recently, which I'm not going to get the number correct, but Glenn knows what it is.  He actually serves on the board of Oregon Tills.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:34](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:21:56):**  He's putting a whole bunch of money into trying to transition companies to farmers to organic.  And I think throwing money at it is going to be necessary because smaller farmers, they don't have any smaller producers and smaller brands.  You know, they don't have an extra like 10 or 20 thousand dollars lying around and then a bunch of labor to throw into the certifications along with whatever else they need to do to transition that way.  
**[0:22:34-0:23:01](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:22:34):**  So I think the market alone can't do it. It's going to take extra help and money. I agree with you 100 percent.  And then we would all benefit ultimately from that.  But, you know, I'm kind of amazed at how things have changed just in the last couple of decades with awareness of the connection between the food that you eat and the real impact that it does have on the planet and your own body.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:43](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:23:01):**  And I feel like more and more people are aware of the connection between what they eat and their personal health.  And a theory that I have, which maybe has merit or maybe not, is that as the cost of medical care has skyrocketed and it's not necessarily so common for every job to offer 100 percent medical, dental, vision, whatever.  People kind of have to take their health into their own hands. And a big component of that is diet.  
**[0:23:43-0:24:23](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:23:43):**  Yeah, totally. And I keep waiting for this wake up call where we do start to be able to translate the health cost as a result of food costs.  And so much of the food that does drive poor health and the health conditions that land people in the hospital is via subsidized commodities that are highly processed and often subsidized through government programs like WIC.  So you're like, wait a minute, like so taxpayers are paying to create a food system that puts extra burden on health care, which ultimately decreases the GDP, decreases the wellness and cultural wellness and well-being, like all the ripple effects.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:24:23):**  And how do you collect all that data to create like a proof, like a data driven proven hypothesis that we're like, hey, if we shift our focus and invest as a nation in soil and good quality food, it actually could help relieve us of some other big burdens that we don't know how to solve, like health care crisis.  That's right.  Climate crisis, rural economic crisis, like all these different things.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:30](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:24:50):**  That's right. Well, I think that could be coming, honestly, because if you just think about like the last, say, 30 years and the acceptance and what's the word, not propagation, but it's so common now for, you know, Joe Schmo meat eater to have like a vegetarian meal a week or whatever.  It's not like, you know, 30 years ago that was crazy or eating soy or it was really weird.  And I think that things are getting a lot better that way.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:48](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:25:30):**  And I think things have changed really, really positively.  And I also think in some regards and I also think that the generation that's coming up, they are on fire.  Yeah, our kids' age group. They look at it so differently.  
**[0:25:48-0:26:18](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:25:48):**  And I'm glad they're not just all like going for these bad diets like overall keto and paleo, because again, like I think the keto movement did more to harm like our businesses, our branded businesses than anything.  It was like, oh my gosh, like, you know, it's just crazy. But, you know, I feel like the next younger generation, they're more concerned about being full from and free from.  So they're like, okay, like, don't tell us like, oh, you're, you're keto, you're free from this, you're free from sugar, you're free from.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:26:18):**  They're like, what are you putting in it? Like, that's actually what we want to know. Like, what's in this? Like, who was involved? Like, did people get exploited?  Those are questions that the younger generation are concerned about. And thank God, because those are the things we need to kind of combat these weird dietary myths that are out there too that drive these fad diets that are not sustainable.  And maybe they're healthy, but they're not sustainable. And I'm like, you know, I love avocados too, but sorry, Dr. McCrola, I'm never going to eat one every day because I live in northern Idaho, and I'm not willing to exploit the people in Mitchell-Cullen to get it to me.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:25](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:26:50):**  Like, it's just, it's a treat. It's not a daily thing. Sorry. Agreed. Agreed. It's one of those things. So it's like untangling this big web. And you guys really do play a critical role.  So like, I know in the last couple of years, it's been fun. So you relaunched like a whole new branded play about your co-packing that you went from Bumble Bar, that was like a brand that would work with other partners to help with co-packing.  But now you have Clean Co-Pak, which is actually specifically dedicated to the role of co-packing. Like, how did that come about? Why did you guys decide to separate that out?  
**[0:27:25-0:28:11](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:27:25):**  Well, we actually retired the Bumble Bar brand this year because it was like 1% of our revenue, 1.5% of our revenue.  Wow. So it was like responding to market demand. And we talked about how complicated it is to get all the certifications. Well, just the regulatory environment in general has become much more difficult, which in some regards is really super good because I think, you know, I know we all want safe food, right?  Everyone wants safe food. And part of that is the regulatory environment. So I just lost my train of thought.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:34](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:28:11):**  So move it, shifting to Clean Co-Pak.  Oh yeah, that's right.  And running two businesses, like running a co-man and running a brand. I mean, they are apples and oranges. And quite frankly, the environment of growing a brand has changed dramatically since you guys started where back in the 90s, you could like go, hey, mountain people, let's do distribution.  
**[0:28:34-0:29:10](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:28:34):**  Can you drop this off to the co-ops on the West? And now it's turned into this, like, kind of a more of an exploitive engine, not to be rude, but it's not easy. And it's very exploitive. And it's very expensive. And they say now, to be a brand like to get anywhere and to hit profitability, you have to be selling eight to $12 million a year to hit profitability because of all these cuts that you distributors and buybacks and promotions and BS at the  wazoo. I mean, is that part of what contributed to this?  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:55](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:29:10):**  It's too much.  And the co-packing business is really personal. Like we have personal relationships with our clients. And just as you described, the branded side used to be a lot more personal. Those days are gone. And the co-packing business was just basically raining down from the sky because the regulatory environment is a lot more difficult.  The idea that a startup brand is going to be able to put together a food factory unless they've got ridiculous amounts of money behind them. But they also have to have the knowledge because and the right people. Exactly. Exactly.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:31](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:29:55):**  Yeah, that's driving a lot. That's driving a lot of demand in co-packing. And also in the last couple of years with COVID, it's been super duper hard for lots of different companies, but especially manufacturing. It's been really, really hard getting people.  And so and then there have been the supply chain constraints. So a number of really large, well-established co-packers have closed.  Yeah, a lot. Like a crazy lot.  
**[0:30:31-0:31:09](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:30:31):**  A shocking amount. So people are scrambling trying to find manufacturers. And then one thing that I, this is maybe a little bit of a tangent, but one thing I did want to mention about another reason why people like doing business with us.  Because we're female friendly, right? From the top down. And we've had clients come in who were the founders. They were the founders of the company. And they would go to tour a manufacturing facility. And they were treated like complete idiots. Like in a needed appendage.  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:45](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:31:09):**  You know, obviously, that's not the approach that we take. But it's there. That culture is there. And I used to be kind of like, oh, is it really that bad? And then I got schooled.  You know, like being out and about and realize like, oh, no, that's a thing. Like it is a thing. So it's so cool working with other value added partners, like people in the middle doing the manufacturing that honor that.  That you're like, oh, yeah, you're the boss. Cool. You know, instead of like going, oh, I brought one of my team members who's a guy and they defer to him in conversation, you know.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:31:45):**  That's exactly what we've heard from like multiple co-founders.  It happens. It happens a lot.  I love being a woman and manufacturing for that reason.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:21](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:31:56):**  Yeah. Yeah. You're far and few between. And there are some fantastic ones out there. And when you find them, it's really cool because you start to learn about their businesses.  And I feel like they develop very strong corporate cultures, too, and have really great retention rates on staff. And it's like a big family.  Like we've gotten to know the Betty Lou's people over in Oregon. Just like I was so intrigued by their story and they're really close to where my mom lives.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:42](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:32:21):**  I just wanted to get to know them. And again, it's, you know, Betty Lou founded it and it's family.  And you get this really cool sense when you leave those places that like you've made friends and potentially people someday you may do business or maybe not.  But you'll recommend, you know, like just because that vibe is tangible. Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:32:42-0:33:03](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:32:42):**  It's really cool. And you don't get that everywhere. There's some really weird, weird commands out there. I'll just put it that way.  And, you know, I'm just thinking as far as like, you know, actions that people can do because we're kind of getting to the top of the hour.  And, you know, like, because you've been on all these different sides. You are a consumer. You're like a food system advocate.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:30](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:33:03):**  You've owned a brand. You've owned a manufacturing. You run a manufacturing plant. Like at the end of the day, like for people who are listening and they want to make a difference,  they want to make some change, but maybe they're not in the food sector. Maybe they have a desk job and they're just doing something completely different.  Like what can people do to make a difference and make this whole world be improved and see the world that you and I want to see in the food system?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:33:30):**  Making a difference in the food system, I think, comes down to personal choices.  So for me, when I'm trying to hit goals, if I just start with some huge, really super hard goal, it feels overwhelming.  So I like really super small, attainable goals. And then you meet with success and then you just keep growing the goals.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:23](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:33:56):**  I think if people could choose to eat vegetarian even like twice a week, I read something about the carbon reduction and it's enormous. It's enormous.  Well, considering that most of the meat and animal products come from combined animal feeding units.  Like we're not talking most people getting like this, you know, utopian grass fed picture, which is a totally different thing entirely.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:53](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:34:23):**  I mean, the environmental impacts are insane.  They're insane. So that's one thing. And then also just like personally that people can do, not related to food, but something that's really great for the environment is just thinking more about their transportation choices.  Like you can carpool a lot. I mean, maybe not necessarily to work, but going out with friends or whatever, we carpool all the time.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:13](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:34:53):**  It's easier to park the car and it's like, hey, let's not have four cars on the road when we could have one.  Yeah, one less engine. Yeah, that's a good point. For sure.  So that's I think those are two choices that are pretty low hanging, attainable actions that people can take.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:34](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:35:13):**  Not to sound like a braggart here, but my husband did shove me into an electric bicycle. I was like, no, no, because...  They're really cool.  They're really cool. Yeah. So I rode my bike. He's way better about being a cold weather biker than I am. I'm a fair weather biker.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:48](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:35:34):**  But I got that bike at the end of June and I commuted to work all summer long.  Wow.  And I rode more than 700 miles in a few months.  
**[0:35:48-0:36:04](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:35:48):**  That's amazing. Good for you.  Yeah. Well, I mean, not to sound virtuous about it, it's like it was such a cool way to start the day. Right.  And, you know, as a business owner, it is crazy stressful. Just crushing stress.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:15](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:36:04):**  It is. And taking time for yourself when you work 60, 70 hours a week, it doesn't often happen.  Especially when you have kids, because when you do have a little bit of time, guess who's going to get it? Kids.  Exactly.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:36:15):**  Because who's not going to get it? Your body.  Yeah.  It's kind of ironic.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:42](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:36:20):**  It is. It is ironic. And the electric bike is like I get my workout in. It takes me about 45 minutes from our house to work.  If I'm riding the electric bike and I get a great workout and then if I drive, it's like 25 minutes.  So really, I'm only, you know, it's like an extra 40 minutes round trip. So it's amazing. It's attainable.  
**[0:36:42-0:37:04](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:36:42):**  That's so cool. Oh, gosh, those electric bikes are incredible. My sister has one and I love it. I kind of covet it.  So maybe one of these years we'll be able to get one too. But hey, so Liz, I have a feeling people are going to want to learn more about you.  Like where can people follow up and learn about you, learn about Glenn, learn about your company? Like where would you recommend people go?  
**[0:37:04-0:37:34](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:37:04):**  I would send them to our websites, Clean Co-Pak and Bumble Bar. We're not selling the brand, we're not selling the product, like I said, but there's a lot of great information on there.  And then also if you look up on YouTube on Bumble Bar or Clean Co-Pak, there's some videos that tell a little bit more about our story.  Fantastic. And if you're out there and you're thinking about starting a bar or a healthy product, I mean, they're just great people to get to know in this industry.  
**[0:37:34-0:38:00](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:37:34):**  So and, you know, more and more great resignation. People are like, I want to start a company. I want to do something meaningful.  I don't think they realize how hard it is, how hard it's going to be to make a living. But it's still very rewarding because you feel like at the end of the day, you're contributing to make the world you want to see rather than just sitting around and griping about it, which is a transition.  So we'll put those in the show notes and, you know, all of that great stuff. So, Liz, thank you so much for joining us.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:17](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:38:00):**  And I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy day to let our listeners know about what you guys do.  It's really my pleasure.  And why manufacturing is important and we need to have transparency and tell these stories so that people understand it's a critical part of the food system.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:27](https://share.transistor.fm/s/e8c9a9bc#t=0:38:17):**  The food system will not work without the work you're doing every day. So thank you so much.  Thank you.  Yeah. Yeah. Keep up the good work. Thanks, Joni.

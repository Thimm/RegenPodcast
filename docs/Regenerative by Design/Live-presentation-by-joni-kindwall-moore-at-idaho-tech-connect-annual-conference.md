### Regenerative by Design  (2022-06-30)  
### Author(s): Joni Kindwall-Moore  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everyone. You are listening to the Regenerative by Design podcast where we  will be getting to the root of health, climate, economics, and food. I am your  host Joni Kinwall Moore. I'm an RN, an ethnobotanist, and the founder of  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:00:16):**  Snacktivist Foods. Join me on this journey as we explore the ideas, stories,  and personalities behind the regenerative food system movement. Food is  the connection between people and planet. In a world where pandemics, climate  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:00:32):**  change, and war have made us feel so disconnected and vulnerable, regenerative  agriculture has become a powerful force for positive transformation and hope.  Here, regenerative thought leaders share how agriculture and food design can  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:00:49):**  create a more resilient system. Hi you guys, I'm Joni with Snacktivist Foods.  I'm sure many of you may be actually unfamiliar with Snacktivist Foods as we  come from our state's panhandle up north, and I'm just really grateful to Jay and  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:01:06):**  everybody for bringing me down here to Boise for the event today. It's a big  honor, especially to start a conversation when we're going to have people like  Andy Scoggins giving a talk, Colin and Matt talking about my favorite food  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:01:18):**  group which is coffee, and other than grains I get really excited about coffee.  And yeah, so this this brings me to my story of Snacktivist Foods. So if you  did read a little bit of our description, I'm sure the first thing that popped out  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:01:31):**  to you is gluten-free. Yes, gluten-free. So I mean it's a topic we can thank for  many great memes, funny jokes on the internet, eye rolls and terrible pizzas  across America, but let's get real, no one ever associates gluten-free with a good  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:01:45):**  time. It's just one of those things, even though it is so important. So we like to  laugh about that. We want to make this a different transition into our  cultural vernacular of food. So how many of you in the audience actually lean  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:01:59):**  towards gluten-free or have a family member that needs to be gluten-free, has  food allergies, vegans, anyone with grandkids in college, you have vegan  grandkids probably, and you can see just by the number of hands in the audience  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:02:14):**  that this food inclusivity is actually a huge issue in America right now,  affecting millions of people. In fact, there was a recent article that was  published in the Journal of American Medical Association that estimated that  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:02:25):**  10% of the adult population has some sort of food allergy or sensitivity.  That's over 26 million Americans. That's a huge portion of our population. So it's  actually getting to the point where we can consider it an epidemic.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:02:38):**  So we'll go to the next screen. So my family is one of these 20 million  families that live in a home with food allergies, and this is the motivation  that led us to create Snacktivist Foods. I grew up on a farm with tons of  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:02:54):**  chickens. Go figure, I'm allergic to eggs. It's one of those funny things. My son, as  it turns out, after hours and hours of pediatric gastroenterology appointments,  cannot tolerate wheat. And then I had a child, another child, my oldest, my  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:03:08):**  daughter, who was allergic to milk. So as you can imagine, no one wanted to invite  us over for dinner. We had become that family. And so, you know, it was  difficult for us to find foods that our whole family could enjoy, but we're still  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:03:21):**  really quality and flavor forward. And thousands of hours of iteration in the  kitchen led us to develop some special trade secrets that made not only a  flavorful product, but a product that had amazing texture and led us to become  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:03:35):**  really interested in the space of sustainable ancient grains. We now  produce a line of baking mixes and finished product cookies and that are  made from ancient grains like millet, teff, and sorghum. Oh, excuse me. And our  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:03:51):**  mantra at Snacktivist is that it's not what we leave out of our food that makes  it special, it's what we put in it. So we're always very focused on quality and  sustainability. Let's see, I'm still on this slide. So now the thing where things  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:04:08):**  get excited. When I talk about Snacktivist, I am passionate about food  allergy inclusivity, but I get really passionate about the ingredients in our  supply chain and the sustainability that plays into that because I am not just  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:04:22):**  nothing against moms with kids with touchy tummies, but I'm also a  scientist with a degree in botany and a background in pharmaceutical chemistry.  I'm an ICU nurse with a background in cardiovascular ICU and diabetic  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:04:34):**  education. I'm a food system activist, as Jay said, and I'm an innovator and I tend  to really lean into the innovation side, especially when it comes to larger  problems that go outside of our kitchen and start to affect our entire nation. So  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:04:48):**  these scientific roots combined with a passion for food systems has the power  to transform our company from moms who are making cookies to a global food  industry leader. Next slide. So I do admit it, I'm a foodie. I love the  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:05:06):**  whole experience surrounding food preparation, food cultivation, and  enjoying food with loved ones around the table. It's actually kind of sacred to  me. I come from a farming family and I grew up farming, so I think that's part  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:05:19):**  of it, but from an academic perspective, I'm not only thrilled by the nutrition,  but I'm very thrilled about the history behind our food and anyone who knows me  knows I have a real history nerd side, so I'm just going to step aside for a  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:05:30):**  second to talk a little bit about food history. So grains were domesticated  roughly 20 to 30 thousand years ago in what's called the Fertile Crescent, and  that's where we first saw the development of wheats, barleys, pulses,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:05:44):**  flax, and it really changed humans fundamentally forever. We became a  civilized agricultural group of people. In other parts of the world they were  domesticating millets, sorghums, tefs, quinoa, amaranths, buckwheats, all kinds of  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:06:00):**  amazing ancient super grains that we don't actually eat very often anymore.  But the world has changed dramatically since the days of the earliest farmers.  Rapid population growth, changes in climate, global migrations of people, and  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:06:13):**  cuisine have really had huge impacts on our food systems, and this leads us to  the modern era. So the biggest historical event that changed our American eating  habits happened about 70 years ago during World War II. So during World War II  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:06:25):**  we had the vast majority of our young men had to leave and go fight the war.  This left us very scarce, not only on food, but on people to work the farms.  This had a massive impact on our food systems because following the war we  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:06:40):**  had this amazing ingenuity event where we developed mechanizations that would  help us produce food more efficiently, and young people started leaving  America's farms, women entered the workforce, and time and  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:06:53):**  knowledge of cooking and baking became very scarce. These economic and cultural  changes dramatically impacted our dietary habits and still do today.  Between the decades of 1950 and 2010 the per capita intake of wheat dramatically  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:07:07):**  increased. It's estimated that it's actually over doubled since 1950.  So this leads me back to Snacktivist. Most of these wheat based foods that we  eat now today are so highly refined they could almost be considered a wheat extract.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:07:21):**  So to me as a scientist and as a nurse it's no wonder that so many  people are suddenly having digestive problems related to wheat and this all  often leads into other systemic allergies and illnesses. Bottom line is  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:07:35):**  modern food is feeding us. There's a lot of miracles here but modern food is also  killing us and it's killing our farming economy too.  Monocrop farming, chemical input dependency, expensive proprietary seeds,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:07:47):**  and pressure from a global commodities market has dealt a crushing blow to  America's farmers who are now experiencing historically high  bankruptcy and suicide rates. Intense weather patterns haven't helped at all  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:07:58):**  either. Farmers are aging out and there's just no one to take over our families  farms. In the Midwest this is especially true. I consider this to be a national  security issue that requires an in-depth look at the grain industry and our  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:08:10):**  entire food system. The same ingredients that are contributing to our trillion  dollar health care implosion are also the same crops that are helping bankrupt  our farmers. We can continue to learn lessons from the civilization of the  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:08:23):**  past, from civilizations of the past when it comes to food systems and this goes  far beyond our just nutrition and diet. We need to stop and  think about how food and food cultivation affects our environment, our  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:08:36):**  economy, and our geopolitics. My husband is a trauma RN and he's a Marine Corps  veteran. He's also a scholar of history so he's an expert on the rise and falls  of civilizations. Foreign invasions, civil wars, disease. These have always been the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:08:51):**  top three reasons why major empires would crumble right? But a closer look  reveals, here's my inner scientist and botany nerd, a closer look reveals that  dwindling topsoil, food insecurity, and malnutrition usually lays the foundation  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:09:04):**  for the rest of these factors to manifest. So when I look around I say  here we are in 2020, we're facing a lot of these same predicaments as many  empires did before us. To fix these complex issues we're going to have to  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:09:17):**  disrupt our current food and agricultural sector in a good way.  Leveraging technology will be a huge part of this. Next slide. So the  decentralization of the grain and cereal vertical has begun and it's in large  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:09:33):**  part due to the consumer demand that's creating a bottom-up pressure on our  largest grain institutions and fueling rapid growth of independent brands.  Large cereal vertical dominators know this and they're very acutely aware  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:09:45):**  because it is a consumer driven trend. Consumers are not only looking for  better for you options, they're also looking for sustainable organic, non-GMO,  and inclusive foods. So what really started these dietary  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:09:58):**  crazes, I mean I'm a child of the 70s and 80s so when I was a teenager  everybody carb-loated. It was like the non-fat days, do you remember those? No  one ate any of that stuff and then all of a sudden the Atkins diet came around and now  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:10:12):**  we have keto, paleo, grain-free. And really when you think about it it's kind of a  grain demonization movement. Well you know civilization was built on grain,  civilization was built on wheat and barley and corn and all these amazing  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:10:26):**  crops that keep the thousands of people in all these regional  economies employed and also feed the entire world. So one of the things I'd  like to think about when I'm talking to people is like do we ever think about  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:10:38):**  how much money our love of avocados, coconut oil, and other imported foods are  putting in the hands of cartels and potential terrorist organizations  overseas? Something to think about when we look at our shifting domestic grain  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:10:51):**  production we can grow superfoods in our own backyard and then we keep that  money in our local economy. Can we feed a global population without grains and  pulses? No we can't and we shouldn't for many reasons. So a food systems mindset  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:11:06):**  approach is what we need for the future of our country. Next slide please. So this  shift has created a gap in the market and a need for smaller agile consumer  facing brands. Snacktivist Foods is focused on these opportunities and our  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:11:21):**  changing grain and cereal sector is beckoning for help from brands like us.  We yearn to bring value to these crops that have a beneficial role in  regenerative ag and soil building as well as the potential to feed the planet  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:11:33):**  sustainably into the future. I really believe that integrating ancient grains  back into our widely consumed products is a first step in redefining our grain  based staples and as they have nutritional value as well as potential  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:11:44):**  for functional food status because of antioxidant levels and other special  nutritional qualities. They're also of significance when we diversify our  agricultural mosaic away from monocropping and the cycles of chemical  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:11:56):**  input dependency. I work a lot with WSU cereal breeders and help write  grants with a lot of our scientists up in U of I and there are a lot of people  working and where their gap is is they don't have a value-added partner to take  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:12:10):**  a lot of these to market. So Snacktivist definitely provides a role of bringing  the science and the innovation that's happening in our grain and cereal sector  to consumers. We're setting out to help disrupt this grain vertical and help  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:12:22):**  reform America's grain consumption patterns. This is a beyond organic, beyond  gluten-free, beyond all the free from stipulations and fear-driven marketing.  Because food is important and we believe the core of this movement needs to be  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:12:36):**  soil. So how do we shift millions of people to consume grains in a new way?  This shift is a more diversified commodity profile and it has  huge impacts on economics too. This could really give America's farmers a boost, a  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:12:49):**  time during unprecedented suffering. In fact I just this morning had an email  plea from a group of farmers in eastern Washington that want to grow millet for  us, especially now that we've been to Korea and we're looking at millet  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:13:03):**  exportation and they are desperate to diversify. They need to for profits.  Millet has been out performing corn and wheat the last few years in the  commodities markets. So you know we as a brand we have very humble beginnings  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:13:15):**  making simple baking mixes, cookies, but this is just the beginning. Next slide  please. So how does a tiny privately financed company in northern Idaho grow  to become a disruptive force like this? Well to be honest it's extremely  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:13:31):**  difficult and the barriers to entry are formidable, especially when you're trying  to get attention in larger retailers, larger food service venues as well. The  need for third-party safety audited facilities, distribution, competitive  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:13:45):**  price points, they all contribute to the 85% failure rate of new brands in the  CPG space. Getting audience with buyers and distributors is nearly impossible, as  is raising money is very very hard for early startups because CPG is a capital  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:14:01):**  intensive thing. So I'm always grateful to people like Zion Bank because not so  many banks are willing to even work with little companies like us. So thank you  Zion Bank. So so far we have been very deliberate in our fundraising as a brand  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:14:17):**  and we've done a small front of just friends and family round and been very  very scrutinizing of our funds and we've bootstrapped our way through it. So I'm  appreciative to all the people who have lent a lot of wisdom, hard work and  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:14:31):**  input to get our company to where it is today. 2019 was a challenging year. We  launched a pilot of a finished product cookie, which you all got to sample, that  was just a test run, but it actually we produced something that could go out on  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:14:45):**  the shelves and had a shelf life, which is extremely difficult to do without a  lot of preservatives and added things. So we were really happy to to actually meet  that milestone. We rebranded our entire company, expanded our trademarks, defended  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:14:58):**  our existing trademarks, developed relationships with scalable strategic  partners, restructured our company to be cloud-based so we can accommodate  growth with a remote team, and we laid the groundwork for growth last year.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:15:10):**  We're already seeing so much potential. I want to actually do a shout out. I saw  Kim here earlier. Idaho Department of Ag Market Development has been super  helpful. We had a chance to represent Idaho at the Fancy Food Show in San  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:15:22):**  Francisco last month where we had one-on-one talks with Target, one-on-one  talks with H-E-B, other huge retailers and food service people across the  nation, and I just really want to sincerely thank them for the help and  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:15:34):**  support that they've given to companies like Snacktivist. We also got to go to  Korea with them just this last fall, and I was absolutely amazed at the  potentials overseas. As countries like Korea really are dependent on imports,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:15:47):**  they can't grow enough food to feed their country, so Snacktivist could be a  valuable tool to getting the best of what the Northwest has to offer to  overseas markets. We feel strongly that we will be the brand that helps to mend  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:16:00):**  a lot of this interface that needs to happen and innovation in our  agricultural and food sectors. We're going to do it, and we're going to take  our farmers along with us, so thank you.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:26](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:16:11):**  So really quick, this has been... so you won the award over at the Boise  Startup Week two years ago. What was it? Trail Mix. The first trail mix. The very first one.  Yeah. So that was really cool. It was very cool. And then you just came back from a big food  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:16:35):**  event. What did Target say about you? Target, they were absolutely  impressed and told us that we were the food brand of the future, basically. So  we're working with them now. We're working with some of their product  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:16:48):**  development experts and their lead of global supply chain to develop a line  that would be appropriate for Target's shelves. Very, very good. Yeah. And you're  on Albertson shelves? We did a trial of our cookie there. Yeah, but then we're  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://share.transistor.fm/s/27f46c5e#t=0:17:03):**  going to switch to a new manufacturer, so we don't have anything on the shelves at  Albertson's. I've pitched the dry mixes to them. We'll have any. Yeah, that'll be even better.  I told you, that frustration with buyers is a real... It's a

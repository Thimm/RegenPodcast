**[0:00:00-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmerama and welcome to Glasgow.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:16):**  This month we're bringing you three stories from the fringes of the COP26 conference.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:21):**  We'll hear about the challenges of growing food in Scotland's largest city, an innovative  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:26):**  and inclusive project researching young people's experience of the food system, and an urgent  
**[0:00:32-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:32):**  call for solidarity with migrant workers.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:44):**  We're really grateful to our community of supporters.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:47):**  It's thanks to you that we can bring you these stories every month.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:51):**  Even the smallest contribution is a big help.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:00:54):**  If you'd like to become a supporter, visit patreon.com forward slash Farmerama.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:04):**  Here in Glasgow, COP was a pretty surreal experience.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:08):**  It felt to me like a combination of a fortified trade fair, an academic conference, an art  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:13):**  festival and a protest.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:16):**  The official blue zone was a huge area right in the middle of the city, shut off behind  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:21):**  towering metal fences patrolled by police and private security.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:26):**  Across the river in the publicly accessible green zone, there were little stalls where  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:31):**  start-ups, academics, NGOs and charities could share their work, as well as a big airy pavilion  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:37):**  reserved for COP's principal partners, the likes of Unilever, Sainsbury's and the Royal  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:42):**  Bank of Scotland.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:44):**  And then in church halls, green spaces and community centres all over the city, there  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:49):**  was almost a festival atmosphere with talks, workshops, discussions, concerts, exhibitions  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:55):**  and film screenings.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:01:57):**  And many of them were platforming indigenous people, people of colour and local residents  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:02):**  in stark contrast to the official conference.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:06):**  In this episode, we'll be hearing from some of the people involved with these fringe events,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:11):**  people who are already doing the work, living the work of climate action, climate justice  
**[0:02:17-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:17):**  and food sovereignty.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:25):**  One of the many, many food-related fringe events was an urban growing Doors Open Day,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:31):**  organised by the Glasgow Community Food Network.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:34):**  It was a chance for people to visit some of the city's market and community gardens to  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:38):**  see and hear about their work.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:41):**  One of them was Tenement Veg, a market garden that's based, for now at least, on a small  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:45):**  plot of land close to where I live on the south side of Glasgow.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:49):**  I went along to meet Mark and Kelly from the Tenement Veg team.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:02:55):**  So we are a workers' co-op and we run a seasonal box scheme in Glasgow.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:01):**  We met in 2017 on a food growing programme and decided that we would like to continue  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:07):**  growing food and yeah, we were looking for a space and a project to get involved with  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:13):**  and there wasn't really a lot going on in the city so we felt like the only way to carry  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:18):**  on really was to start a new growing project.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:22):**  We run a box scheme for 22 households at the minute and supply some wholesale and work  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:28):**  with a community-led supermarket or grocery shop and run volunteer sessions at the site.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:36):**  So we're about two and a half miles from the city centre.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:39):**  Most of our Vegbox members live within a 20 minute walk of here.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:44):**  We're in quite a dense neighbourhood, there's lots of tenement buildings around.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:49):**  It was an old tennis court as well so it used to have red ash underneath and we've just  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:03:57):**  been building the soil on top for a few years.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:02):**  So we've been adding quite a lot of green waste compost.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:06):**  We practice no dig and use lots of cover crops and green manures.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:11):**  I guess one of the challenges is the site is quite small so we've quite quickly reached  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:17):**  its capacity and that links into another challenge.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:20):**  We're looking for a bigger site with a longer term lease.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:25):**  And I guess one thing to mention is we live in Govan Hill and there's a lot of deprivation  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:31):**  and food poverty where we live so we're quite aware of the need to make local food accessible  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:39):**  to people in our neighbourhood.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:41):**  We received some funding from the Land Workers Alliance Community Resilience Fund and that  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:47):**  project is about making food more accessible and making sure locally grown sustainable  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:52):**  produce is available for people who might not otherwise have access to it.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:04:58):**  And so we were looking at options of who to work with in our neighbourhood and the Peoples  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:02):**  Pantry, Govan Hills Peoples Pantry, seemed like an obvious project.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:07):**  They have a community shop and people pay a subscription to do a weekly shop and there's  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:12):**  a real emphasis on choice and fresh produce so it's a move away from food banks.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:18):**  So the funding we got from the Land Workers Alliance means we provided a weekly harvest  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:24):**  to the shop for three or four months.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:27):**  And when that funding ran out we used the Pay It Forward scheme from our Vegbox customers  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:33):**  and then we used that money to provide food to families in the area and to carry on working  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:39):**  with the Peoples Pantry.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:41):**  I guess tenancy has been a tricky issue so we moved here in 2020 and we had a one year  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:49):**  lease which was then extended until the end of 2021.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:52):**  Yeah and we now know we can stay until the end of 2022 but yeah not having a long term  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:05:58):**  lease makes it quite hard for crop planning and just planning in general.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:03):**  And we have a long waiting list, people get in touch all the time to sign up for the Vegbox  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:08):**  but yeah we do 22 boxes and some wholesale and that is the capacity really.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:15):**  Getting access to land, finding land, it has been a long slog.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:20):**  We try a variety of different ways and speak to different people and I mean it is the challenge  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:27):**  in the city, like there's a lot of land is up for development, it's earmarked for building  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:33):**  houses and whatever else and there's not going to be much room for ecological food growing.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:41):**  You know we've been working with the council a bit and stuff but we've not really got anything  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:45):**  yet, we've been out the city and stuff like that, looked at old farms like way out the  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:51):**  city but then you don't really get the benefit from growing close to home and the people  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:06:57):**  who would buy it wouldn't get the benefit either so it's definitely a challenge, it's  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:02):**  something that needs to be prioritised really.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:07):**  Supply chain issues, fertiliser shortages, the food system is coming home whether we  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:14):**  like it or not in Britain, you know it's crunch time almost so whether the government or the  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:21):**  council prioritises land or not we're going to have to at some point.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:27):**  Yeah I feel like it's a really frustrating process, yeah extremely slow, I guess there  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:34):**  are people everywhere who want to set up growing projects and they have the energy and the  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:40):**  enthusiasm and the will to do it but there's this massive block in the way.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:45):**  It's not a transparent thing about who owns land, you know you kind of see a patch of  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:50):**  land and finding out who owns it takes a lot of work and yeah I guess often if you put  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:07:56):**  in a land registry request it costs you money to find out who owns that bit of land which  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:01):**  is pretty mad.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:03):**  There's also a question about post Brexit agricultural policy and support and it definitely  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:10):**  feels like urban food growing is missing.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:13):**  There's a lot of support for rural food growing but urban support definitely needs addressing.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:20):**  We've had a variety of sites but within very close distance to each other, probably within  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:24):**  what, eight mile radius maybe or something over the past few years.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:30):**  Our second year of growing probably say that was 2018 and that was super dry, I think that  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:38):**  was the year that Glasgow had the record of the hottest day that it ever had and sometimes  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:45):**  we'd turn up and the grass was on fire.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:48):**  I've never seen grass on fire in Glasgow.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:08:51):**  Last year was extremely wet, it was very humid and wet basically from July forwards so we  
**[0:09:02-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:02):**  had lots and lots and lots of slugs, we also had mildew and disease damage for crops because  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:11):**  of the moisture really and the heat and this year I guess it's been completely different  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:17):**  hasn't it, less slugs, much drier.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:21):**  Just the heat was a real challenge and it was a real struggle physically working in  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:26):**  it, definitely changed working patterns a little bit, like coming out a little bit earlier  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:31):**  in the mornings and then going in between like one and four pm.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:37):**  Just irrigating became another challenge.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:41):**  There is a little bit of rainwater catchment on site but it didn't rain for six weeks and  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:47):**  when it did rain it rained a tiny little amount.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah so having to do a lot more watering.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:53):**  On the one hand some crops grew very quickly but some crops really struggled.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:09:58):**  I think one of the real challenges is the unpredictability so if you knew in advance  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:02):**  it's going to be a really hot dry summer then maybe like planting varieties that are more  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:07):**  suited to that and I think is that not knowing is the real challenge.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:13):**  I guess there's like a certain acceptance of not all the crops surviving and if we have  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:21):**  a really diverse range of crops growing then that should bolster the kind of resilience.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:29):**  Also I mean we don't do it probably because of the size of the space but seed saving as  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:34):**  well, the crops are doing well, the crops tend to look like they've survived and they've  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:40):**  thrived and they've given us a lot of food as well, probably trying to make sure we save  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:46):**  some of that seed.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:48):**  The more we grow the more we're going to find out what's going to be able to deal with unpredictable  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:54):**  conditions within a diverse selection of crops.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:10:59):**  So obviously COP is happening.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:02):**  What's your feeling about COP?  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:03):**  Do you have any...  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:04):**  Do you really want to ask that?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah!  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:08):**  Do you have any expectations, any hopes?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:11):**  Do I have any expectations about COP?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:14):**  No, definitely not.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:16):**  It's a mirage, it's built to deceive people that the system can abolish itself, which  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:25):**  it can't.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:27):**  Capitalists aren't going to abolish themselves, they're the ones that have created these ecological  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:31):**  conditions.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:33):**  They're not going to vote themselves out.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:36):**  One thing I want people to learn from COP is that we need to abolish capitalism and  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:41):**  that will be the only way we can get ourselves out of the climate crisis and imperialism  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:45):**  and colonialism.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:46):**  That's how I feel about it.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:49):**  Yeah, it's kind of like a sadness really.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:56):**  That's one thing I personally also don't want people...  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:11:59):**  Because we all feel sad and nihilistic, but personally I feel like we need to be done  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:04):**  with nihilism.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:05):**  We need to learn from systems around the world, we need to learn from global south movements.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:12):**  It needs to get over itself, basically that's how I feel.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:17):**  We need to learn from the people who are doing it now.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:20):**  No more nihilism, because we need to get it done.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:24):**  We have no choice, so no more nihilism.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:27):**  You can still be sad.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:30):**  I am sad, but not nihilistic.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:33):**  They said they laugh cry all the time.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:37):**  I feel like that is a great term, just laugh crying.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:43):**  Definitely done that recently.  
**[0:12:46-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:12:46):**  It's like, what is this emotion?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:16):**  Nourish Scotland is a charity working for a fair, healthy and sustainable food system.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:26):**  They hosted a whole series of fringe events during COP, including one called Young Seeds  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:31):**  for Your Thoughts, towards a just food system.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:34):**  The event itself was organised by Feedback, a campaign group that seeks to challenge power,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:39):**  catalyse action and empower people to achieve change within the food system.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:44):**  This year, Feedback's been running a participatory action research project with seven young people,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:50):**  some of whom are from racialised minority backgrounds and some of whom are neurodiverse.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:13:56):**  As you'll hear, participatory action research is an approach that challenges the idea that  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:01):**  research has to be done by academics, or by experts from outside the group being studied.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:07):**  Instead, it centres ordinary people as researchers.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:10):**  It's based on the premise that everyone's innate knowledge and skills are every bit  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:14):**  as valuable as academic knowledge.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:17):**  And in a sense, it's about decolonising research.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:22):**  The event at COP was a chance for the young people involved in the research project to  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:26):**  share their experience and their findings.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:29):**  They gave an incredibly powerful presentation that covered a lot of ground.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:33):**  In it, they highlighted some of the many power imbalances they came across within the food  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:37):**  system and suggested ways that we can all foster positive change.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:42):**  After the event, I spoke to two of the participants, Warami Jackson and Marlon Opiko.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:48):**  I'm Warami Jackson.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:50):**  I'm a 22-year-old agricultural student who is very passionate about all things food and  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:14:59):**  all things agriculture.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:02):**  I'm also Nigerian, yeah.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:05):**  Nigerian and Lebanese, yeah.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:08):**  I'm Marlon.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:09):**  I'm 25 years old.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:11):**  So I got into the food sector simply through an internship that was with growing communities.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:18):**  It piqued my interest at the time because I was looking to do something completely different  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:22):**  because my background was within finance.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:24):**  I studied at university.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:27):**  And yeah, since then, it's been an amazing journey.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:30):**  And it's brought me here today.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:31):**  We're at COP26.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:33):**  You know, we've just come off stage.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:36):**  And I feel like the possibilities now are almost endless.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:40):**  I feel so immersed within the sector.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:43):**  And I'm just hoping to learn a lot more as well.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:46):**  I got into food and things that have to do with food through different formats.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:54):**  So for food, it's always been really important to me because my mom cooked a lot.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:15:59):**  So there was a lot of home cooking, local buying from the markets and things like that.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:05):**  I just always never knew how my food was grown.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:07):**  But I was really interested in food.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:09):**  So due to all these factors and a couple of gap years when I decided I didn't want to  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:16):**  do something I was good at, like chemistry for petroleum engineering, I didn't want a  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:21):**  generic 95 job because I was more hands-on, I decided I wanted to go into the food and  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:26):**  agriculture sector and found my university and yeah, my story of food began, well, visualized  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:34):**  rather from there.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:36):**  I started learning on my course, applied farm management, which was very broad.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:43):**  Topics of organic and things were mentioned, but not in full knowledge.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:47):**  So that was my mindset.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:49):**  I was really going into, had plans for conventional ways of growing.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:53):**  So it got to the second year when I had to do a placement.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:16:57):**  The types I saw that I could tap into weren't accessible due to the need for some kind of  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:03):**  driver's license, UK driver's license, tractors one, and spring licenses, which I was in the  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:09):**  kind of in the works on pre-pandemic.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:11):**  Yeah, so I started looking for something that would kind of accept me.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:16):**  So then I found on Facebook the opportunity for a placement with feedback and growing  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:23):**  communities combined.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:24):**  Shout out to Sophie.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:27):**  And that's when I was really exposed to organic and agro-ecological practical ways of farming.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:33):**  And I realized the amount of passion that I had for that and the passion I had for small  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:38):**  scale farming and urban farming, accessible farming, where people could see where they're  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:44):**  growing their food and really understood the benefits, like the social, economic and sustainable  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:49):**  benefits of the type of system.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:52):**  I concluded my placement with them and found the power process.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:17:57):**  And you know, I took my lived experience and story.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:00):**  And yeah, that's how we got here today.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:05):**  So for the last four months, a group of young people like myself have been involved in a  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:11):**  participatory action research project.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:14):**  And this is all about how we can work towards a just and regenerative food system.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:21):**  So based on our personal and collective lived experiences, how can we work towards a just  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:28):**  and regenerative food system?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:31):**  That was the mother question.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:32):**  And we had an umbrella question under that, which was what is your reality of the food  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:36):**  system?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:37):**  So these were like the main anchors behind a lot of the research that we was doing.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:43):**  But we had many questions below.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:45):**  But that was the key question we wanted to ascertain from people.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:51):**  This came from more or less discussions in a group.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:18:54):**  So we just sat together and felt like, what kind of questions can we ask people?  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:00):**  And leading to that, like, what is the outcome?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:04):**  What kind of information do we want to pull from people?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:07):**  Once we just started with that question, that main question, it just started flowing.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:13):**  Question after question, we felt like, this is the direction we want this conversation  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:16):**  to go.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:18):**  Participatory action research, PATH for short, is a research process of inclusion in a very  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:26):**  succinct way to say, as opposed to leaving research into the hands of scientific researchers  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:34):**  alone and things.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:35):**  You rely on layman knowledge, people who have experienced things relative to whatever you're  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:44):**  researching.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:45):**  And you kind of use them as the muse to find out, you know, your objectives and your theories  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:53):**  and your research question and eventually your results, your analysis.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:19:58):**  So it's giving power to the lab rats.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:02):**  The lab rats conduct the experiments and, you know, they kind of also analyze from their  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:08):**  point of view because, I mean, who better?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:12):**  Who better to do this?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:14):**  So that's what makes it different, is finding the people out there that are going through  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:18):**  the things and then using them as the muse to kind of find solutions to the problem.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:25):**  Because if you don't have enough knowledge about it, deep knowledge, which has to do  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:30):**  with like feelings and values and how well it affects the people, you wouldn't know how  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:34):**  well to handle the problem.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:35):**  So that's what makes it different.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:38):**  Our research took two forms.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:40):**  We did analysis, qualitative analysis, which is basically surveys and interviews.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:47):**  So one-on-one, asking people their stories.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:52):**  When we went to the interview stages, we decided the kind of people that we wanted to ask questions  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:20:58):**  and the kind of questions that we wanted to ask them that kind of had to do with our personal  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:04):**  stories.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:05):**  Yeah, for example, maybe me finding out knowledge on culturally appropriate foods or labor or  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:13):**  access to those kind of things, or just knowledge on supply chains.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:18):**  It was part of my story.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:20):**  So I wanted to know those things.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:21):**  And yeah, Marlon could probably share what he went out there with his interview to find  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:27):**  and his target audience and stuff.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:30):**  Yeah, so predominantly, we were just aiming to speak with young people.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:36):**  So this would be between the ages 21 to about 25, 26.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:42):**  But actually, in our survey responses, they were open to people outside of that age group.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:49):**  So even though it was targeted towards young people, we wanted to hear from a diverse range.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:54):**  We didn't really want to leave any stone unturned because I feel like everybody's experiences  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:21:59):**  and their stories do matter.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:01):**  But our target audience was the age range that I mentioned, because young people, I  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:05):**  feel that their voices are maybe less heard or is not as important.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:10):**  So we wanted to give also them agency, like they can actually have a say and speak on  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:17):**  what experiences they have, what are their struggles.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:19):**  Some of the things that came out of our research were we found that a vast amount of young  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:25):**  people got their food consciousness, as I'll call it, like when they decide, this is what  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:33):**  I want to eat, this is the lifestyle I want to take, when they gain independence.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:38):**  That's at an age when they're probably moving out of their parents' house or moving into  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:44):**  uni.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:45):**  Just a stage where you have a choice.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:49):**  So that was one of the main findings.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:51):**  And we got that from finding out that that's when they thought, oh, I want to eat this,  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:55):**  I want to eat that.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:22:57):**  Some people stay in their habitual ways, but a vast amount of them was like, yeah, this  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:01):**  was the point that I gained my food consciousness.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:03):**  So that was one of the findings.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:05):**  Another finding was that a large amount of people do not think about farmers when they  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:08):**  go food shopping.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:10):**  And this is also due to the disconnect between farmers and consumers.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:16):**  And yeah, this is also because of longer food supply chains.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:21):**  We also found out that a lot of them are plastic conscious as opposed to climate conscious.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:29):**  So when they hear climate consciousness, what they mainly think of is plastic, which kind  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:34):**  of shows the food and agriculture sector not being included in the climate agenda.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:40):**  So the people don't even know how much of a contributor and solution the food and agriculture  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:46):**  system is.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:47):**  So that's what we found.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:49):**  And we also found that people will always choose price and affordability as opposed  
**[0:23:55-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:23:55):**  to, you know, value and nutritional content, which is within reason because of how accessible  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:05):**  and how the price of food is sort of like a facade.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:10):**  It's not real, it's not reflective.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:12):**  And I also found out they're very aware of fast fashion and how not to be involved in  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:18):**  fast fashion because the workers and laborers are definitely not paid.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:21):**  But they don't equate it back to the food system, taking it back to the price of food  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:27):**  in high end outlets.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:29):**  It's not reflective of the effort that's being put.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:31):**  So the farmers definitely are not paid a normal price for that.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:34):**  So that was one of the findings that they do not conceptualize farmers being paid their  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:42):**  effort and being compensated.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:43):**  But then they realize this for other sectors of work and life, like the clothing sector  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:48):**  and the fashion sector.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:50):**  And we found that more time, the reason why they don't really want to take the extra  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:24:55):**  effort to go to the local stores is because it's too far from them, which kind of shows  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:01):**  how there's not enough accessibility in terms of availability.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:05):**  Like there's not enough local markets around you.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:09):**  If you're in a town, there's probably like one and to get there, it's not very much possible  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:14):**  as compared to like the next door high end outlets at your left, at your right, you know,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:20):**  so it's easier.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:21):**  And they'll always choose the easy way because they're used to it and probably because of  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:26):**  values that haven't been awakened yet.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:29):**  I would say if we can just inspire people within our own communities, within our circle  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:35):**  to just make little changes within themselves, because I feel like it's a systemic change  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:43):**  that we're kind of working towards.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:44):**  So it's built of old habits need to be thrown away and we need to replace them with new  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:51):**  good habits.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:52):**  So the only way that's going to happen is doing your bit little by little, consciously  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:57):**  making decisions.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:25:58):**  Like I want to shop local once, maybe twice a week, just because I know it's going to  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:04):**  help the planet, it's going to help the environment.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:07):**  And actually might just help myself because it's more nutritional.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:10):**  I'm saving myself time because I don't have to travel too far to certain outlets.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:15):**  But I thought it was just inspiring.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:17):**  I just want to be able to inspire.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:20):**  If it's one person and they make those changes, they can go and inspire the next person.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:25):**  So I'm hoping this is what the research will do.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:28):**  Really giving people a voice and allowing them to say, you know what, I can take control  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:34):**  of what I can do personally, but I know it's going to move us towards a bigger change,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:40):**  create a bigger impact within society.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:42):**  So I would say that was that's one thing, you know, that I hope would happen.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:49):**  I hope people gain real empathy towards the situation.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:26:58):**  I just hope people are very empathic towards the farmers, you know, towards local stores,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:09):**  towards themselves as well, their gut health, the importance of, you know, nutrition in  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:14):**  your food, towards the climate, towards the environment.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:19):**  I just hope they build the consciousness.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:22):**  Like I hope the conversation never dies.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:25):**  I hope the story keeps forming and keeps being told.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:29):**  And I hope also that there is an opportunity for people who are actually being affected  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:35):**  by the situation to be part of the decision making, to give context to what can be done.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:41):**  Because there are lots of solutions available, but are they really realistic to do what we  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:46):**  need them to do?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:47):**  You know, and I just hope that people realize that you can do something about the situation  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:52):**  and your tiny effort does not go unnoticed.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:55):**  You can make a difference.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:27:57):**  And to be so authentic, to bring other people along with them, because that's the only way  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:01):**  that we can get there.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:02):**  If we have a story and there's no one to hear it, then there can't be any change.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:06):**  We just have a theory.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:09):**  That's all we have.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:10):**  But we don't have a strategy if no one's there to listen to it.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:12):**  So I just hope the story never dies and people just keep being intentional about how they  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:18):**  live their lives and think about their values, like reassess their values.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:23):**  Because when you do that, you have like the emotional equipment to have mindful action  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:29):**  towards yourself, the world, the environment, the farmers and the food system.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:34):**  And I hope as a whole and as a broad view that the food and agriculture system is actually  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:41):**  is really, really introduced as one of the solutions to the climate change because it  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:45):**  has so much potential.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:48):**  There's a recording of the event on Feedback's YouTube channel, and I'd really encourage  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:51):**  you to check it out.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:28:53):**  You can find a link in the episode description.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:03):**  Another hive of food related activity during COP was the Land Workers Alliance Agroecology  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:08):**  Hub, which was hosted in a community space called Civic House.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:12):**  One of the events that took place there was a discussion titled Solidarity and Organising  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:16):**  with Migrant Workers in the Food System.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:19):**  It was organised by Catherine McAndrew from the Land Workers Alliance and also featured  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:23):**  Sarah Woolley, Secretary General of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:29):**  It was a fascinating, challenging and really eye opening discussion that highlighted the  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:34):**  need for solidarity between people in different parts of the food system.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:40):**  Alongside Catherine and Sarah, there was an empty chair to represent those food workers  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:44):**  who aren't able to speak in public forums like this about their experiences and their  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:49):**  needs.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:50):**  I started by asking Catherine, what do workers' rights have to do with food sovereignty?  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:56):**  For me, food sovereignty has always meant the control of the food system by the producers  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:29:59):**  and consumers of food.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:01):**  And this is a concept which has been formulated by Livia Campesina, and that is an organisation  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:07):**  which is made up of mostly of peasant producers.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:11):**  The UK was probably one of the first countries where the peasantry was forced off the land.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:17):**  And so increasingly what you have in this country is that food production is undertaken  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:22):**  by wage labourers.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:23):**  It's undertaken by people who are, rather than producing stuff on their land and selling  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:28):**  it to others, it's people who are selling their labour to larger capitalist businesses.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:33):**  So in my mind I think wage workers are a key agent in creating food sovereignty because  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:38):**  they are the people that have an interest in really changing how the food production  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:42):**  system works and having it so their interests are represented.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:46):**  Agricultural workers are traditionally seen as very exploited, seen as very marginalised.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:52):**  Due to shortages of agricultural labourers in the UK at the moment, there's a lot of  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:30:56):**  discussion about this issue but it's always discussed in terms of agricultural workers  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:01):**  just as inputs into the system.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:03):**  The humanity and agency of these workers just never seems to come out in any discussions.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:09):**  In a country like the UK where a lot of food producers are now divorced from the land,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:13):**  a lot of them are now people selling their labour to larger companies, I think a key  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:17):**  agent in creating food sovereignty in this country is agricultural workers and food production  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:22):**  workers themselves.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:23):**  There's a shortage of agricultural labourers at the moment and so that means I think agricultural  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:28):**  labourers potentially could have a better bargaining position.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:32):**  So it means that the agricultural labourers that are going to be coming over are going  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:34):**  to be worked a lot harder and be working a lot longer hours.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:39):**  Many agricultural workers come from Eastern Europe where currencies have appreciated quite  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:43):**  significantly since accession to the European Union in 2005 whereas the UK's currency is  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:49):**  losing its value so workers are going to be earning a lot less when they come over here.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:53):**  And in addition as well, post Brexit there are going to be some changes to the migration  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:56):**  system.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:31:57):**  One of these proposals and the one I think is going to be the one that becomes the norm  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:03):**  is the seasonal worker pilot.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:05):**  So the way that works is it's a temporary migration programme where workers are recruited  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:10):**  by two recruitment agencies, Concordia and Powerforce.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:15):**  The workers they're recruited and so they come over to the UK on a temporary basis,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:20):**  they're here for six months, they're assigned a specific farm, it's very very difficult  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:25):**  for them to move from that farm.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:27):**  If they're sacked from that farm they're deported.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:29):**  I think it really shows the purpose of the new immigration patrols that the Conservative  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:34):**  Government are imposing.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:35):**  It's not about increasing wages or protecting workers' rights, it's utterly ridiculous.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:40):**  What it is is about making the workers that come here increasingly dependent on their  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:45):**  employer.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:46):**  Their employers can dismiss them and if you're dismissed it's not just you've lost your job,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:51):**  you're having to re-uproot yourself.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:53):**  So with the seasonal workers pilot, one example that's come out quite recently is of a group  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:32:59):**  of workers who participated in this from Barbados.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:02):**  So I think about around 100 workers came over as part of the scheme.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:06):**  They were billeted on a strawberry plantation I think in Kent and the conditions of work  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:11):**  on this farm were awful.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:12):**  Like people were placed in caravans that were unsanitary, toilets were not functional, people  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:20):**  were being asked to work very, very long hours and if they couldn't work at the rate that  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:24):**  the bosses were expecting they would not be offered work the next day.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:28):**  And additionally because also the costs of housing and uniform and food are extracted  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:33):**  from workers' paychecks, so some of these workers were earning less than six pounds  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:37):**  a day for a ten hour day.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:42):**  That level of exploitation is just extreme.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:45):**  And of course as well as part of that contract it's not like they can't leave the farm,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:49):**  they can't go and get accommodation elsewhere.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:52):**  One of the cases we came across in Spain was a case of a company called Biosabora which  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:33:58):**  is nominally an organic producer with a very, very poor record of workers' rights and one  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:06):**  of the instances that happened at this enterprise was workers were being asked to spray plants  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:11):**  with pesticides without protective gear being issued to them.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:15):**  So this made a lot of workers very sick.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:17):**  So we've got to see who in this set up has the interest in moving away from a pesticide  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:25):**  and agrochemical based food production system.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:28):**  It's not the bosses of Biosabora, definitely not.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:30):**  They've got every incentive to continue producing in that way.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:33):**  Instead it's the workers themselves who in order to protect themselves and to protect  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:35):**  their livelihoods must seek to move towards a more sustainable and more organic way of  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:41):**  producing things to both protect themselves and their health.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:45):**  So I think it's a combination of the conditions are going to be worsening, workers are going  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:49):**  to be earning less, the migration system is changing in a very negative way and also in  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:54):**  many countries in Eastern Europe, namely in Belarus for instance which is a big source  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:34:59):**  of labour for the seasonal workers' programme.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:02):**  There's been big social uprisings there in 2020 with a sort of general strike by industrial  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:06):**  workers.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:07):**  In Romania you've seen general strikes there, I think you had a general strike there in  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:13):**  2017.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:14):**  In Berlin you've had the women's strike over the right to access to abortion.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:18):**  And what you find is that experiences of struggle travel along sort of migration paths, so when  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:23):**  workers have experienced struggles in their own country they're going to carry that new  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:26):**  found sense of dignity to wherever they end up.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:29):**  So these combinations of factors make me think this is now the time to be looking at this  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:35):**  additionally as well.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:36):**  This is a point that a European coordination of Via Campesina there has made in relation  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:40):**  to discussions around low wages and the high price.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:43):**  The issue with organic food is often that, oh, organic food is more expensive and I think  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:47):**  that's, yes, that is true.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:49):**  Organic food takes longer to produce and therefore is always going to be more valuable than something  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:53):**  that's been mass produced in a very short amount of time.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:35:57):**  We want organic food to be the main source of food in this country.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:00):**  We want everyone to be able to afford and eat and take part in the consumption of good,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:06):**  high quality, well-produced food.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:08):**  And in order for that to happen, wages have got to go up.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:11):**  As I said at the moment, and this is the point that ECVC have made, cheap supermarket produced  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:16):**  food is being used as an alternative by governments to social policy and improved wages.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:22):**  You can deal with a low wage economy, you can have a low wage economy if food is kept  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:27):**  artificially cheap.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:28):**  However, the real price of keeping that food so cheap is the degradation of the land, the  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:33):**  soil and the people that are involved in food production.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:36):**  The supermarkets in this country are essentially four large corporations controlling 80% of  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:40):**  the grocery market.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:41):**  That in a sense sets the conditions for the entire food production supply chain.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:46):**  If I remember correctly, the markup on a punnet of raspberries is about 33%.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:53):**  So of the price of a punnet of raspberries, 33% of that price is pure profit for the supermarket.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:36:59):**  And it's no wonder then for that Tesco earned about 2.7 billion pounds in profit last year.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:05):**  This isn't Tesco's profit, this is workers' profit.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:07):**  It's workers that have made this money for them, it should be workers that are benefiting  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:11):**  from this at the very, very least.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:13):**  Often you end up with a situation where you have intense competitions between farms that  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:18):**  are trying to seek to produce the standards that supermarkets want, which in turn ends  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:23):**  up that the profit margins of these farms are often very, very low.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:27):**  And then these farms have almost no choice, but to degrade the conditions of work on their  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:31):**  farms in order to essentially just make enough money to survive.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:34):**  And even then it's quite difficult, even then it's not possible without a very, very large  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:39):**  level of subsidies from central government.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:41):**  That's where I think the connection is, in the sense that it's both small organic farmers  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:45):**  and agricultural workers are being exploited and having their conditions set by the same  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:51):**  system, a system which is ultimately controlled by the supermarket corporations.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:56):**  When it comes to the sort of organisation of these workers, I think the UK doesn't really  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:37:59):**  have that much of an agricultural workers' movement at the moment.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:02):**  That's something I'm seeking to change.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:03):**  But there is a strong agricultural workers' movement based in Spain with the SOXAT trade  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:07):**  union and Italy as well with the USB trade union.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:10):**  These are organisations that regularly post updates about what they're doing, about the  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:14):**  disputes they're involved in.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:15):**  I think the most practical thing that, you know, the sort of bare minimum that someone  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:19):**  can do in this situation is keeping aware of what the situation is in places like El  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:23):**  Maria and seeing like, okay, well, if there is a strike of these workers, then we should  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:27):**  be placing pressures on the supermarkets that are buying from the farms in question.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:32):**  Additionally, I think this is more further on, but I'm very inspired by an organisation  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:36):**  called the Coalition of Immaculate Workers, which is based in the United States.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:40):**  It's made up of Mexican tomato pickers based in Florida and they, when they were set up  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:45):**  in 1993, were the worst paid farm workers in the United States.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:49):**  What they did was through a combination of taking strike action at, you know, on certain  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:54):**  farms and building links specifically with student groups, namely the Student Farm Worker  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:58):**  Alliance.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:38:59):**  This sort of alliance between consumers and producers of food was able to sort of force  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:04):**  a number of the large corporations that controlled the food system, the first one they managed  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:09):**  to win over was Taco Bell, to sign up for, you know, essentially sign up to some national  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:15):**  agreements and it's known as the Fair Food Programme.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:18):**  So this would mandate that the corporation in question would pay about a cent extra for  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:24):**  a, for a, a pun up tomatoes and then this would fund, you know, wage increases for the  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:29):**  workers and also sign up to a worker led monitoring programme of conditions.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:34):**  What that agreement has managed to do is transform these workers from the lowest paid to the  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:38):**  best paid.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:39):**  You've gone from $7 an hour on average to $14 an hour and also has made massive improvements  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:45):**  on sort of rates of sexual violence and harassment of workers on a farm level.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:51):**  And so looking into the future and this is what I'm kind of hoping to be looking into  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:55):**  the practicalities of, we need consumer solidarity groups.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:39:58):**  Consumers need to get organised, workers need to be in touch with these consumer groups.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:02):**  When disputes occur or when workers want to extract concessions from the supermarkets,  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:07):**  these consumer groups are then able to say we're not going to buy from you until you  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:10):**  accept the, the demands of the workers or we're not going to purchase certain tomatoes  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:15):**  until this is done, which then increases the bargaining power of these workers.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:20):**  We are the people where the solutions are going to come from.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:22):**  It's getting down, organising, building links with one another, building links between organisations  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:26):**  and coming up with plans to take our social movement forward.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:29):**  In that instance COP has been an absolute, absolute success.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:33):**  I think we've made some excellent links between people and never mind the, never mind the  
**[0:40:38-0:40:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-cop-26-glasgow-growing-participatory-action-research-and#t=0:40:38):**  buzzcocks in the convention centre.

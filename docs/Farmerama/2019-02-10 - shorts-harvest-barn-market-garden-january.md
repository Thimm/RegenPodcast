## Shorts: Harvest Barn Market Garden January  
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:00):**  Hello Farmerama, this is Joel in the market garden at Harvest Barn Farm Shop. This is  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:08):**  probably going to be one of my last, if not the last, podcasts from here. I'm going to  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:14):**  go inside to record the rest of this because you probably won't be able to hear me if I  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:19):**  stay outside.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:23):**  Hello again, so I'm inside now, sheltered from the wind. So I'll be leaving the farm  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:30):**  where I'm currently growing. It hasn't worked out for a variety of reasons. It's a bit sensitive  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:37):**  to talk about the reasons it hasn't worked out, but there's been personal reasons to  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:42):**  do with what I'm looking for, family commitments and differences of opinion with the landlords  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:48):**  about how to operate and expectations. I have until the end of February to pack up and leave,  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:55):**  so I'm trying to harvest as much as possible so I don't lose too much money on what I've  
**[0:00:59-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:00:59):**  already sown and planted. There's various medium-sized items of infrastructure that  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:08):**  I need to pack down, take away and store. The issue of the polytunnel is one of the  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:15):**  most complicated things to sort out. I'm not sure yet if the landlords will buy it from  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:20):**  me or if I'll have to take it down, which will be a shame after only a year's use because  
**[0:01:25-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:25):**  that will mean that the plastic and a lot of the timber will be wasted. It's been an  
**[0:01:32-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:32):**  interesting experiment. I still have this dream of wanting to set up a market garden  
**[0:01:40-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:40):**  that is profitable and successful. I feel like after a year that I probably know less  
**[0:01:49-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:49):**  than I did at the beginning, but hopefully I'll go into any future land-based relationship  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:01:57):**  a lot wiser. It does feel like a lot of the success of projects like this, if you don't  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:04):**  own your own land, is based on luck. The incentive to invest time and money and infrastructure  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:10):**  in a land project if you don't have long-term security is quite low. I'm certainly much  
**[0:02:15-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:15):**  more wary now of getting into this kind of relationship because you can put so much of  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:23):**  all that time and money and energy into something and then it could be over after a year. There's  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:29):**  not many times you can do that in your life before you think it's not worth it and give  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:34):**  up. But I am looking for a new plot of land to start growing on. I will leave this farm  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:41):**  with both a sense of relief because it hasn't been right for some time, but also sadness  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:47):**  because I put in a huge amount of energy and time and I was looking forward to building  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:51):**  on what I'd achieved this year. I have a number of regular and new customers and I was really  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:02:57):**  enjoying being able to supply them with fresh seasonal organic veg. But growing good quality  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:03:06):**  veg for local people is incredibly rewarding and I'm very disappointed to not be able to  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:03:11):**  carry on doing that for the foreseeable future. But I'm hoping that at some point in the next  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:03:16):**  year or two there will be another opportunity that will come up. So thanks for listening  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:03:22):**  and I do hope to continue updating you with news of what happens next. Do get in touch  
**[0:03:28-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-january#t=0:03:28):**  if you have any comments to make and see you next time. Thank you, bye.

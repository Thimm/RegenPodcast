**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, I'm Joel, one of the two growers at Norwich Farmshare, along with Jack. It's the  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:19):**  very end of October. It's been an amazing summer though. We've grown over two and a  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:24):**  half tons of veg since June. Our membership is now over 100. We've had two very successful  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:31):**  open days and lots of media coverage. We haven't quite seen the last of the rabbits.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:37):**  They're a very tenacious animal, so they are still causing a few problems. I have to say one  
**[0:00:43-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:43):**  of my biggest worries about working in a CSA when I started, as opposed to working on my own, which  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:51):**  I was last year, was how to manage volunteers and make sure that our food production, as we are  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:00:58):**  primarily a production farm, didn't suffer due to having to provide support to people with little  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:05):**  experience. But I'm very glad to say those fears were entirely unfounded. We are extremely fortunate  
**[0:01:11-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:11):**  to have some incredible volunteers on the farm. So this episode is devoted to letting them talk  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:18):**  about their experiences of being part of a CSA. I will reflect on some of the challenges that we've  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:23):**  faced over the summer and some of the goals that we've got for next year in future podcasts. But  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:30):**  for now, over to our volunteers and members, Zav, Richard, Burkhardt and Dulce. Thanks.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:38):**  Hi Burkhardt, thanks for taking the time to talk to us.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:41):**  Hi, my name is Christian King Zavanayu, or Zav. My wife's Hannah Kim.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:48):**  My name is Tanya.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:50):**  And why did you join Norwich Farm Share?  
**[0:01:52-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:01:52):**  It's a really good question. So we were looking for an opportunity to buy organic  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:02):**  fruit and vegetables locally. And we wanted to support local growers rather than  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:06):**  constantly going to the supermarket. Yeah, we are constantly surprised by the quality of the veg.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:13):**  And yeah, just week in, week out. It's incredible, absolutely incredible.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:18):**  Well, I love everything about it really. I like coming out and being in the fresh air for a few  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:24):**  hours. I like learning about plants and because I didn't know anything at all about gardening or  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:32):**  plants before I came. So it's very fantastic learning. And it's giving me confidence so that  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:37):**  in my own garden, I can go home and plant stuff without being worried, what am I doing? And I love  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:44):**  growing food. And I think the vegetables are fantastic.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:48):**  So every week, it's something new and something different. And it's seasonal. We're pretty much  
**[0:02:52-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:02:52):**  plant based now. And yeah, it's pushing our menu creativity. It's fresh, it's different.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:03):**  I would challenge you to find anywhere near as good a quality fruit and veg from Farm Share,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:12):**  from any supermarket. And I would also suggest that if financing is a concern, then you'll  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:22):**  probably find that you would spend as much in a supermarket for lesser quality fruit and veg.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:27):**  So what's it like being a member of Norwich Farm Share? And how does it benefit you?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:32):**  Well, it's a whole new hobby for me. But also more than that, I think it's because I'm so  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:38):**  interested in food and cooking and healthy living and also to do with caring for the soil.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:45):**  I feel like I'm doing something instead of sitting at home worrying about all the terrible things  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:51):**  that are happening. I feel maybe doing some small tiny thing, like helping to grow some  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:03:58):**  vegetables which are not poisoning anybody or the earth, then that means a lot to me.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:04):**  And we also like the idea that as a member, you could be actively involved yourself and  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:10):**  basically learn how to grow vegetables. From the first time we came, we came first on open day.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:18):**  There was a very good atmosphere, there were very good vibes, everybody was very friendly.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:24):**  Well, everyone is really nice and helpful and also really always says thank you whenever I  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:31):**  do anything, which is really nice. I feel appreciated even though I don't know what I'm doing.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:36):**  So it seems to help and I like feeling that I'm part of a team and I'm helping out.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:42):**  You know, even though I'm a complete beginner, that's nice and everyone's really nice.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:47):**  There seem to be an increasing number of people volunteering and I hope we can develop that.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:04:55):**  And the challenge I suppose is to expand in a way which is sustainable.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:05:01):**  I think it's the future and I think we need to really be serious about growing our food in this  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:05:07):**  way as much as we can locally and eat local and eat in season because they're the tastiest and  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:05:13):**  the healthiest foods to eat and also to keep things local. It's really important.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:05:19):**  The local aspect is very, very important.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-december-2019#t=0:05:22):**  Yeah. Well, thanks for your time. Thanks for your help. Thank you. Bye.

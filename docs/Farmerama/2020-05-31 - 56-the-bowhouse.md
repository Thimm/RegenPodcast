## 56: The Bowhouse  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, it's Joe, with a short message before we start the episode.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:09):**  This month we're bringing you a special episode about The Bow House, a food hub in Fife, in  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:13):**  Scotland.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:15):**  Katie actually visited The Bow House way back in May of last year, 2019.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:20):**  For one reason or another, it's taken a long while to get the episode ready, but we're  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:25):**  really pleased to be able to share it with you now.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:27):**  Obviously, rather a lot's changed in the last year, so at the end of the episode we'll hear  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:33):**  an update on how The Bow House has responded to the pandemic.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:37):**  Speaking of which, we know it's been a challenging time for a lot of people, and we're planning  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:42):**  a series about how food and farming communities have been affected and changed by the Covid-19  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:48):**  crisis.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:49):**  If you have a story to tell then please get in touch via the website or Twitter, let us  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:53):**  know what you've experienced.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:00:56):**  And one more thing, this episode was made by Katie Revel, who also produced our cereal  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:02):**  series, and we've just found out that it's been nominated for two Guild of Food Writers  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:08):**  awards, which is very exciting.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:11):**  Okay, that's enough preamble, enjoy the episode and take care.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:21):**  Welcome to this special episode of Farmerama.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:28):**  We're in the East Neuk of Fife in Scotland.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:30):**  It's a coastal region dotted with picturesque fishing villages and blessed with fertile  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:35):**  volcanic soils.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:37):**  But as is the case in much of the UK, very little of the food produced here is actually  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:43):**  consumed locally.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:45):**  In this episode, we'll be hearing about one attempt to change that situation.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:50):**  It's a project called the Bow House and it describes itself as a place for transforming  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:01:54):**  raw ingredients from Fife into produce ready for everyone to enjoy.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:00):**  The Bow House opened in 2017 and it's part of the 2000 hectare Balkaski estate, which  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:06):**  also includes an in-hand mixed livestock and arable operation, as well as a number of tenanted  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:12):**  farms.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:13):**  Since the late 17th century, the estate has been home to the Anstruther family.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:18):**  I'm Toby Anstruther, I suppose I conceived the Bow House and have started to put it together.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:23):**  I farm here at Balkaski and Bow House is, if you like, an extension of that farm and  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:28):**  a way to try and bring some of that produce from the farm to the public.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:32):**  The Bow House was conceived as a way to replace a missing link in the local food chain, the  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:37):**  link between producer and consumer.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:40):**  I suppose I was frustrated to see that a lot of our produce was just disappearing off in  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:45):**  big trucks and that people driving around had no idea what was in the fields and how  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:49):**  that related to them.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:51):**  I was frustrated that the local restaurant had fantastic broccoli on the menu, but he  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:02:57):**  got it from the Glasgow veg markets because although it was growing in fields all around  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:01):**  him, there was nowhere for him to get it from locally.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:04):**  So it just felt like that local food system had been dismantled by successive moves towards  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:10):**  scale and so I felt that we needed to do something to try and reintroduce some smaller scale  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:18):**  links in the chain of food.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:21):**  The Bow House is housed in a collection of renovated farm buildings.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:25):**  There's a cafe and event spaces, including a huge barn that once a month plays host to  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:30):**  market weekends.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:32):**  During Bow House market weekends, stallholders from Fife and other parts of Scotland gather  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:38):**  to sell vegetables, meats, drinks, seafood, honey, preserves, flowers and flour.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:45):**  There are street food stalls as well, and cooking demonstrations and live music.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:50):**  But as well as offering these monthly retail opportunities, the Bow House is also a year-round  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:55):**  production space for small food businesses.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:03:58):**  So it's a space for producers to take raw materials either from us or elsewhere and  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:03):**  then to transform them.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:04):**  So Scotland the Bread, Andrew Whitley, so he's taking grains that we grow for him and  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:10):**  then he's milling them and then producing the flour.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:13):**  A lot of the ideas came from seeing elements of Bow House elsewhere.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:20):**  So for example in Stockholm, the Rosen Garden is fantastic.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:25):**  That is a community growing space and a community garden where people are collaborating together.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:31):**  Maltby Street and Druid Street and Spa Terminus are production spaces where the public get  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:36):**  access through at one time of the week and understand the process and really, I suppose,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:43):**  are recruited to be proper fans that understand what they're buying and who they're buying  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:47):**  it from.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:48):**  And so our production spaces and our markets and things are designed to try and pick up  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:52):**  elements of that and deliver it into the East Neaker Fife.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:57):**  My name's Rosie Jack.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:04:58):**  I'm the market and events manager here at Bow House.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:02):**  I think for me, Bow House is, I mean I feel like these words are always a bit cliche and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:07):**  a bit overused but a food hub.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:09):**  And I think we're really trying to be a place for meeting, gathering, collaborating together,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:15):**  food production processes, giving that space for all these small businesses to operate  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:19):**  from is really important.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:21):**  And bringing people together in this way opens up new opportunities.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:25):**  You see things happening where somebody goes, I don't know how to do this part of my business.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:30):**  And the guy next door goes, oh, I can do that.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:32):**  I'll help you out.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:33):**  And that's really important because otherwise they would be on their own and that would  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:35):**  maybe hold back a lot of businesses.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:38):**  Another of the Bow House's goals is to demystify food production, to start to rebuild people's  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:44):**  practical, emotional and cultural connections with the farmers and other producers who feed  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:49):**  them.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:50):**  Market and events manager Rosie herself comes from a farming family.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:54):**  For me, coming from that agricultural background, I mean just because I've been brought up in  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:05:58):**  that way, I find it easy to sort of say, right, this is what I think people don't understand  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:02):**  about the food production process.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:04):**  So let's try and figure out the most sort of fun and simple way of explaining that in  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:08):**  the most transparent way.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:09):**  I always feel that sometimes agriculture gets a really bad flack for things that really  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:14):**  are out of their control.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:16):**  And it's part of the process that's been like that for many years.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:18):**  And sometimes, you know, that process is changing and we're always trying to get better.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:22):**  My family's from the dairy industry and we're always trying to get better.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:26):**  But sometimes we do get about hard time and just being really honest about it and just  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:29):**  saying, yeah, this is how we do it.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:31):**  And you know, for us, it's really important that we do it this way because this is the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:34):**  safest or the best way or the highest quality product that we can give everyone.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:38):**  So that's what I try and get across in the market space every month.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:46):**  Let's hear from a few of the stallholders selling their produce at one of the Bow House's  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:50):**  market weekends.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:52):**  Who are they and what do they think of the project?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:06:56):**  I'm Robert Campbell and I've got a small farm in North Fife.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:00):**  We breed grass-fed Dexter beef and we are currently nearing the end of our organic transition  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:06):**  with the Soil Association.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:08):**  This farm is sort of a second career project.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:11):**  I used to work in London and we moved up here about 10 years ago and bought a small farm.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:17):**  And we thought if we're doing a small farm, we should do something niche.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:20):**  So we wanted to organically farm the land, very, very good for the wildlife, the birds,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:26):**  the bees, the pollinators.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:28):**  And we also wanted to bring in cattle into the ground as well as sheep.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:33):**  And we've also started our new project, the silver pasture, where we've got about 50 acres  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:38):**  of woodland, which we actually now graze with cattle as well.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:42):**  And what we're finding is the cattle are bringing a lot of wildlife and a lot of birds into  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:47):**  the woods.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:48):**  And you'd be surprised just how well cattle do in woodland situations.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:07:54):**  Fife is very, very good at local food and having loads of local producers.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:00):**  And Bohus is an opportunity as a local producer to actually market our local produce, which  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:05):**  comes from, must be 15 miles up the road to all the people who actually attend Bohus.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:12):**  And it's a great way to speak to consumers who actually want to buy local beef, organic  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:17):**  beef with provenance.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:19):**  My name's Katrina Monson.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:21):**  Along with my husband Gavin, we own Middle Way Drinks.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:25):**  We make water kefir based soft drinks near Loch Lomond.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:28):**  So water kefir is a fermented drink.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:31):**  So we use water kefir grains, which is the equivalent of how a brewer might add brewer's  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:35):**  yeast to sugar water.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:36):**  We add our water kefir grains to mineralized sugar water.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:40):**  They then convert that into vitamins and organic acids.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:45):**  And it just creates a unique flavor and brings the sugar level down.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:48):**  We then add pure fruit juices to make our different flavors.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:51):**  The challenge for us is that water kefir isn't really well known.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:08:55):**  So a lot of it's about educating our consumers to understand what it is and why it's better  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:00):**  than your usual carbonates and syrup mixes that most soft drinks make.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:05):**  But it is exciting and we're just coming into our first summer of trading, a full summer.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:09):**  So we're quite looking forward to seeing how it goes.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:12):**  I am Susie and together with my husband, I run a wee charcuterie company in Leith called  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:18):**  East Coast Cured.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:19):**  We specialize in the production of slow cured Scottish meat, mostly pork, but we dabble  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:25):**  in a few different bits and pieces.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:27):**  Beef, duck, all sorts.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:30):**  It's really about taking the best Scottish produce and making amazing charcuterie.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:36):**  Basically we love food.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:38):**  It's always been a really important part of our relationship.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:41):**  It's informed our travels and things.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:43):**  My husband used to live in the south of France, love eating charcuterie, have talked for years  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:47):**  about the lack of good Scottish charcuterie, given how good our produce is.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:53):**  We built a curing chamber in the Eves of Eratic several years ago that was all environmentally  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:57):**  controlled.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:09:58):**  Started testing recipes and things and then decided it would be nice to have a family  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:03):**  business and yeah, and here we are.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:07):**  So it's been about a year since we started trading at the boathouse and obviously we  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:11):**  sell our produce here, but we also buy the odd Tamworth pig from them.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:15):**  The estate manager's sons rear some pigs, so yeah, we take a pig or two and it's quite  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:20):**  nice to have a special for customers on boathouse weekends.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:23):**  Hi guys, help yourself to samples.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:26):**  I've just been asked some questions.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:27):**  We make them all in Edinburgh using Scottish pork.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:31):**  No worries at all.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:33):**  We've loads of traders and the traders are amazing.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:35):**  Sometimes it'd be great if we had some more seasonal and that's really hard because the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:40):**  margins are so low.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:41):**  You know, veg has been really hard to get a hold of.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:43):**  You've got loads of veg farmers, but to be fair, those farmers don't want to stand behind  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:47):**  a stall on a Saturday or Sunday.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:48):**  Absolutely fair enough.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:49):**  You know, they work very hard.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:51):**  So getting those seasonal produce, we've really struggled to get fresh dairy products.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:10:56):**  So those are the things that I really want to build upon is getting those traders in  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:00):**  and involved as well.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:02):**  I mean, we could have lots of jam makers, which is great.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:05):**  That's really important.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:06):**  Lots of alcohol traders, which is great.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:08):**  But trying to get those fresh producers is really what I've struggled with in trying  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:12):**  to find those people.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:14):**  And on a bigger scale, you always think collaboration is going to be the easiest part and everyone  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:19):**  wants to work together.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:20):**  But sometimes it's actually quite hard to make sure everyone is having a fair chance  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:24):**  or some people shout louder than others.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:26):**  And it's giving the maybe quieter people that have an amazing product the chance to shout  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:30):**  about it as well.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:31):**  Or even just tell their story.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:33):**  That's why we do the cooking demos.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:36):**  We had a gin demo this morning at 11am, which is a bit early.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:40):**  And then we've got a baking demo that's just about to happen.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:43):**  And then a walk and talk with Jason down by the coast as well with seaweed.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:49):**  On which note, let's meet some of the producers who found a home at the Bow House, not only  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:11:54):**  in the form of production and retail space, but also as part of a community of businesses  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:00):**  eager to share skills and knowledge.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:02):**  Here we are, so that's quite a quick little walk.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:09):**  Already here you can see why the East Nuuk is really good for seaweed.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:15):**  Because you get such a big tidal range.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:18):**  Jason Biles is the founder of East Nuuk seaweed.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:21):**  He harvests seaweed for sale and also runs guided foraging trips.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:26):**  So you know all those rocks and another, probably not even another hour, most of these rocks  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:31):**  will all be covered up.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:33):**  What will be right up here.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:34):**  For me, actually, part of the magic of actually being out there in that environment is that  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:39):**  you're walking around on land that only gets exposed maybe four or five times a year, some  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:45):**  of these on the super big tides.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:48):**  And also there may have not been humans walking out here for 10,000 years.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:52):**  And maybe the last time a human was walking out there was before the last ice age.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:12:57):**  So that alone, you know, for me is part of the magic.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:03):**  Different species grow in different areas.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:05):**  But just up here a little bit further out and you know maybe I can run out quickly if  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:10):**  you guys don't want to.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:11):**  Well you can see there's a bit of pepperdolls growing up there.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:14):**  And that's one of the varieties of seaweed when people try that, it's something they  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:18):**  really don't expect.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:20):**  So I can try and get us a little bit of that if you like and then it might be time to head  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:23):**  back after that.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:24):**  It was just a quick walk today.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:26):**  Perfect.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:28):**  Just so I can get the levels right, can you just tell me the classic question as always,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:35):**  what did you have for breakfast?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:38):**  Well I had seaweed, eggs on toast with seaweed is what I had for breakfast.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:44):**  Definitely seaweed.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:45):**  On brand, very good.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:48):**  Cool, thank you.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:49):**  I'm originally from New Zealand.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:50):**  I've been in the East Nuke now for three years.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:54):**  I came up here for a commercial seaweed harvest management job.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:13:59):**  I've now decided to go into business for myself.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:04):**  But for me my big focus is really about education and educating the local people of the East  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:10):**  Nuke about the abundance that is available right on their back doorstep there.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:15):**  And obviously with that comes educating them about safety and also educating them about  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:21):**  sustainability.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:22):**  But for me a big passion is not only seaweed, it's just all wild food in general.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:28):**  I really think that through eating more wild, seasonal and locally produced food that we  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:35):**  can actually all make a reduction in our impacts on the planet.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:41):**  I was in Glasgow and a friend of mine had heard about seaweed harvesting up here in  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:47):**  Fife.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:48):**  So I came up and I checked it out and really it's all gone from there.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:51):**  My first experience in the East Nuke was Ely sunsets, Kingsbarn sunrises and the heron,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:14:59):**  who was my first resident.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:01):**  I met up here in Fife and the heron for me really signifies that space where earth, sea  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:10):**  and sky all meet.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:12):**  And that's his hunting ground, that's where they hang out.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:15):**  So that's really how the heron ended up on my logo because we share that space together  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:21):**  and we're all connected, whether it be heron or humans, we're all sharing this space.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:26):**  It's not about me being down there and maybe chasing the heron off because he's taking  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:30):**  my space, we're going to share it together.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:33):**  I believe that everyone that lives here in the East Nuke with that total abundance that's  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:38):**  on their back doorstep, they should all have the confidence to go and interact with that  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:44):**  and harvest a bit of their own seaweed.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:47):**  And obviously with encouraging people to go down and forage seaweed, I need to also really  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:52):**  be educating people about how to do it in a safe manner, how to do it in a sustainable  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:57):**  manner.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:15:58):**  So again, it's just about giving people the confidence to go and try it out, you know,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:02):**  and have a bit of fun with it.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:04):**  I'd like to start supplying a bit of fresh seaweed to local businesses, but again, I'd  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:09):**  like to keep it local.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:11):**  I don't see the point going out there and then cutting it sustainably, walking home  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:16):**  and then sending it off somewhere, wrapping it in plastic and sending it away.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:19):**  I don't really see the point in that.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:21):**  If you're not in the East Nuke, go and find your own coastline, you know, and start harvesting  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:25):**  it locally.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:26):**  You've got the right to roam, so anyone can roam on any land.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:32):**  In Scotland and the UK actually, there can be private ownership of beaches, but you can  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:38):**  walk on there as long as you're being respectful.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:41):**  If you're feeling inspired to forage seaweed yourself, make sure to ask the owner of the  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:45):**  beach first.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:47):**  In the UK, that might be a local council, the National Trust or an individual landowner.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:52):**  Jason also points out that if you're harvesting deep in the intertidal zone, you're likely  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:57):**  to be on Crown Estate land.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:16:59):**  Visit thecrownestate.co.uk and search for seaweed to find the information you need.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:05):**  It's a bit the same as harvesting land plants.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:08):**  If you're harvesting plants on land, you shouldn't rip it up from the roots because in effect  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:13):**  you've killed the plant and there is regulations against that.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:17):**  So that's why, you know, if you're taking seaweed, you should leave the whole past on  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:21):**  there and leave a certain percentage of the plant behind.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:24):**  You know, then it's still living, it can regrow, you're not breaking any rules.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:28):**  I mean, the whole ethos behind foraging in the first place is that you take what you  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:32):**  need, you know.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:33):**  If you want to take a bit extra for your neighbour because they can't get out, then that's fine.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:38):**  You shouldn't be down there taking away kilos and kilos of it.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:41):**  You know, also you have to be careful of things like water quality, all the rest of it.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:46):**  You know, so it does pay to do a bit of research and on my tours, you know, I go into the sustainability,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:51):**  I go into the regulations and I go into ways that you can find out about the water quality  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:17:56):**  and places that you can contact to find out.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:00):**  Pretty much all seaweeds are edible, as in the fact that they're not toxic for you.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:05):**  So yeah, unlike mushrooms, there's pretty much no toxic seaweeds out there so, you know,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:09):**  I kind of encourage people to head down to the beach and just start munching on any old  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:12):**  seaweed and you'll soon know whether it tastes good or not.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:15):**  But you know, you can be confident in the fact to know that you're not going to do yourself  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:18):**  any damage.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:20):**  Jason believes the boathouse is bringing multiple benefits to the East Nuke.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:25):**  For me, boathouse is a really invaluable resource for the local communities around here because  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:30):**  first of all, it's a way that you can all come together, you know, learn about new things,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:36):**  it's about networking, you know, it's always a nice fun day.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:39):**  You know, just the fact that it's an indoor-outdoor venue as well, you know, that's really important  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:43):**  and even on the East Coast where we get a bit less rain, for me, I mean, the biggest  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:48):**  thing about it is about the networking.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:50):**  Is there anything else you'd like to say?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:52):**  Any sort of message you'd like to send out?  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:56):**  Hi Mum!  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:18:57):**  No, I think just really, you know, I'd love for people to contact me and come out on a  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:03):**  tour and learn more about, you know, what I do and what we can all do together, you  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:08):**  know, and let's have some fun, let's have fun with it.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:12):**  Here's Rosie Jack again.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:13):**  I always think let's have some mess and some fun and some noise in the market and also  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:18):**  be really honest about it.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:19):**  If we can make the food process and eating and drinking really honest, then we have nothing  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:25):**  to hide, then people, you know, they'll get involved and they'll understand it clearer  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:29):**  because they'll get to do it themselves and get hands on, that's really important.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:34):**  So I'm just about to start cooking some langoustine.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:39):**  Clément Bougerie of Langoustine the Box, a company sourcing and selling fresh local  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:44):**  shellfish.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:45):**  Actually, what I use is, it's clarified butter, ghee, because I found it won't burn as easily  
**[0:19:53-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:19:53):**  as normal butter on high heat and then it's just, yeah, five minutes on high heat, giving  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:03):**  them a turn every two minutes and then it's very delicious.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:09):**  Just add the langoustines.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:23):**  So my name is Clément, I'm French obviously.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:27):**  So what I do here at Bauhaus, so I'm using this unit for my business and my business  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:34):**  is based on sourcing local shellfish and delivering it to local people.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:41):**  So general public, but restaurants as well, it's about reducing the food miles.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:47):**  Because it's food mile reduced, it's so fresh as well.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:51):**  So how did a Frenchman end up in Fife, helping to reinvigorate the local shellfish trade?  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:20:56):**  I used to live in France, in the south of France, and I used to be a farm business advisor.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:01):**  I was working with young farmers, people starting their own farm business.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:07):**  And in the south of France, we used to have a lot of small vegetable growers trying only  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:13):**  to get to the markets, to direct selling things.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:17):**  And when I arrived in Scotland, first what struck my partner and me, we thought, it's  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:23):**  so difficult to buy local food.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:27):**  Although we were seeing in the fields around vegetables being harvested, things like that,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:33):**  we were just amazed that it wasn't possible to, I mean, then we realized it was possible  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:38):**  to, but you had to know the place, the guides, but it was difficult to get local food, being  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:44):**  either vegetable, seafood, things like that.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:48):**  So yeah, in a way, perhaps it was a kind of solution from myself to be able to eat local  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:55):**  food as well.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:21:57):**  I had the idea, because when we arrived in Scotland with my partner in 2014, we used  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:03):**  to rent a house in Pettenwim, just by the harbor, and I get to work for the fishing  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:09):**  cooperative.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:10):**  At that time, they had the idea to open a direct sale outlet.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:14):**  So I did for them the market survey, and we found that there was a big demand for local  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:21):**  shellfish among local people.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:23):**  But in the end, the fishing cooperative, they didn't go for this project.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:27):**  So after some years of thinking and doing something else, I decided, why not start doing  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:33):**  this?  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:34):**  And actually, the fishing cooperative were very happy with it, because in a way, I'm  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:38):**  selling their shellfish.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:39):**  I'm talking about their shellfish, so they are very happy with me doing this.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:44):**  Almost all the langoustines, lobsters, and crabs landed in Pettenwim.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:48):**  Everything is sent abroad, sent to France, Germany, Spain, Italy.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:22:54):**  So yeah, I've decided to perhaps take a tiny part of it and redirect it to local people.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:01):**  Clement explains why it was, and in fact still is, so difficult to source local shellfish  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:07):**  in an area with such a strong fishing tradition.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:10):**  Until perhaps 30 years ago, most of the landing in Pettenwim was whitefish, flatfish.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:17):**  At some point, the stocks collapsed in the first of force.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:21):**  So fishermen had to turn towards another thing to fish.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:25):**  So they decided to fish for langoustines mostly.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:28):**  And I think at that time, langoustines wasn't something really eaten here.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:33):**  So it was easier for them, and it made more sense economically just to send everything  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:39):**  in bulk to continental Europe, I think.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:42):**  But with the last and the present fishing manager at the fishing cooperative, there  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:48):**  is this will to be able to redirect, even if it's a tiny part, some of the local shellfish  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:54):**  locally.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:23:57):**  When we did the market survey, yeah, we realized that a lot of people were just thinking, it's  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:02):**  crazy.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:03):**  There is a huge amount of langoustines landed daily in Pettenwim, and we just can't get  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:07):** ... I mean, it was possible, but you had to know the fishing manager.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:11):**  You had to phone the cooperative first and ask for some langoustines.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:15):**  No, it wasn't convenient.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:17):**  So yeah, that's why I more or less decided to do this.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:21):**  And he discovered that there is local demand.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:23):**  So the response amongst local people is great.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:28):**  Great, yeah.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:29):**  Well, honestly, I still need to sell a lot more if I want at some point in my business  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:35):**  to be profitable.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:36):**  But I think I'm still in the phase where I need to grow until I reach the point where  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:42):**  things are getting better.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:43):**  But yeah, for example, during a market like this, a lot of people local, or not so local,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:49):**  but a lot of people just come, even if they don't buy anything, some of them are saying,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:53):**  finally, we can get some local langoustines here.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:24:56):**  So there is a very good response from the general public here in the area.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:02):**  The boathouse is provided Clermont with a base, but also access to customers and a network  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:07):**  of peers.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:08):**  I'm using the unit, this unit.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:10):**  So I'm renting it from Balkaski.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:12):**  Basically, I come with all the langoustines I need, grab the up store, I wash everything,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:17):**  and I pack everything, and then with ice.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:21):**  I start from here to do my delivery tour, and that's it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:24):**  So I need space just to store a lot of boxes, a lot of packaging.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:27):**  I need space to wash everything with a lot of clean water.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:31):**  So yeah, I needed a place to do this.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:33):**  And what's very great about the place is that you have a market once in a while.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:39):**  So when I'm doing a market like today, I don't have to travel a lot of miles with all my  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:45):**  stuff, all my gear, just to be able to sell something.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:48):**  So it's very, very easy.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:50):**  And what's great also is that there are now all the producers here.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:25:55):**  So it's very interesting to be able to just exchange with all the guys and to see that  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:00):**  we have the same problems.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:02):**  We want the same things.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:03):**  So it's great.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:05):**  Clermont has some tips for other people setting up local food businesses, whether in the East  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:10):**  Nuuk or elsewhere.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:11):**  What I would say is try not to be isolated.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:14):**  Try to contact other people, like-minded people perhaps, other producers.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:19):**  Just not to work alone.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:21):**  Because I think when you start a business, especially when you are the only one, you  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:26):**  have no employee yet, yeah, it's very easy to be alone during all the day when you are  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:31):**  working.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:32):**  And just to be able to talk to other like-minded people, other producers, other business managers,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:38):**  it's very, very important.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:41):**  Don't lose your face.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:42):**  Yeah, don't lose face in local food.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:45):**  That's what I would say.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:49):**  And finally, just a few steps from the Bow House, in a small corner of the Balkaskie  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:54):**  Estate is East Nuuk Market Garden, a mixed fruit and veg enterprise.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:26:59):**  My name's Connie.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:00):**  I'm running a agroecological market garden with my partner here at Bow House.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:07):**  And I also work for Scotland the Bread as a miller part-time.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:09):**  Yeah, and my name's Tom.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:12):**  And I work full-time down at the market garden, growing veggies and fruit, mostly veggies at  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:17):**  the moment.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:18):**  We always had like an aspiration to do some kind of work on the land and farming or market  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:26):**  gardening.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:27):**  It was kind of the thing you talked about in the pub, like, it wouldn't be fun to do  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:29):**  that.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:30):**  And then we quit our jobs and went traveling in Europe and woofed on farms.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:36):**  And basically the first experience we had was woofing on an intensive market garden  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:41):**  in the northwest of France.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:43):**  And the guy was a fantastic teacher and a really good host.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:46):**  And we had a really amazing time basically, and very quickly realized that we were, this  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:53):**  is what we wanted to do and the style of thing we wanted to do.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:27:55):**  So then I did that for a bit longer, but basically then came back in January of last year, because  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:01):**  we realized that that would be the time if we wanted to get an internship or a job.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:05):**  And basically the job that we ended up getting was up here in Fife at Pillars of Hercules,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:09):**  which is a really longstanding organic vegetable farm in the west of Fife.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:14):**  So we worked there for a season and then found out about the opportunity to rent some land  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:19):**  from the Bacchuskie estate here at Bauhaus and kind of saw that it was the time to try  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:24):**  and jump in.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:25):**  And so we kind of just jumped in basically and started this year.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:30):**  We kept thinking like, do we really have enough experience to do this?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:33):**  You know, maybe it's totally laughable, but in the end we just thought, well, this is  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:38):**  an opportunity that's here now.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:40):**  Bauhaus was just getting started.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:42):**  The cafe wasn't up and running yet.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:43):**  And we just thought, actually, someone else is going to take that bit of land.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:47):**  We really want to do it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:48):**  My mum's growing flowers next door.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:49):**  So that's how we knew about it.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:50):**  Really, we were helping her at the time.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:53):**  And so we just thought, well, we could move somewhere else and get another season or two's  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:57):**  experience somewhere else.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:28:58):**  But actually we like Fife.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:00):**  We've made friends here now and this is an opportunity.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:03):**  So let's just take it while it's here and we can just, you know, learn as we go kind  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:08):**  of thing.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:09):**  And for their fledgling food business, the Bauhaus provides valuable opportunities.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:14):**  The vision of the Bauhaus is a kind of like a food hub for Fife, which is sort of linking  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:19):**  different kinds of producers together.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:22):**  And as vegetable growers, that's really interesting for us because we're sort of like a, you know,  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:27):**  like a primary product producer.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:28):**  But then we have like a, there's a cafe here that we can sell directly to, you know, 200  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:32):**  metres away.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:34):**  They want to take everything that we can sell to them.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:36):**  So that's a really massive plus when you're starting out to have that, you know that there's  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:41):**  a market for you.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:43):**  There's a seaweed business that's starting and he's interested in growing as well.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:47):**  So we're going to hopefully do some trials of using like pure seaweed compost.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:51):**  And there's just a mix of different things going on that means that we, you're going  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:29:56):**  into the kind of the scene that's here easier as outsiders, you know, as people who aren't  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:00):**  doing grow up here.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:02):**  And now we've moved to the East Nook, which obviously traditionally a fishing area.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:07):**  But now I think there are more smaller producers and, you know, the Balkaski estate are being  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:15):**  supportive in that sense, trying to, you know, make the units in the building in Bauhaus  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:18):**  for smaller producers.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:20):**  Because that's such a big outlay for a small producer to have, you know, all the food safety  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:27):**  and hygiene and meet all the different specs and regulations and everything.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:30):**  So if those are already in place, set up by someone who's got the cash to do that, that's  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:35):**  a really great thing, a supportive thing to have.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:40):**  The bit of land that we rent from Balkaski estate is kind of too small and awkward for  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:45):**  their style and scale of machinery now.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:48):**  So what they've done is turn it into two smaller two acre plots.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:53):**  But they put deer proof fencing around the whole thing.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:56):**  They brought in water and electricity.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:30:58):**  They've let us put down hard standing concrete base for our shed.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:01):**  So in that sense, that's so supportive, you know, like how much it would cost us to put  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:07):**  deer proof fencing around two acres of land and bring in all the water and electricity  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:11):**  by ourselves.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:12):**  It's just astronomically expensive.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:14):**  In that sense, we just couldn't have been luckier.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:18):**  Before we even took the lease last year, they asked us like, oh, for next year, if you're  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:23):**  growing, what could we do to make it easier for you?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:26):**  Like we put a green manure in so they spread and seeded the red clover that's here now,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:32):**  which we're still benefiting from like a year later after they sowed it, which is brilliant.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:36):**  And we're sort of slowly carving niches out of like the forest of red clover that's now  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:40):**  growing everywhere.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:41):**  And when we get manure from them as well from their farm, which they've converted to organic.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:46):**  So the manure is organic and it's from a mile or two miles away.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:51):**  So that's always like a question about like, you know, fertility, like where does it come  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:55):**  from?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:56):**  Do you produce it yourself?  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:57):**  Do you have to buy it?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:31:58):**  What's, you know, there's the energy of like producing whatever the fertility is, but also  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:03):**  the transport of it.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:04):**  For us, it's just a really amazing resource that we can have so close by.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:09):**  And for them, you know, we get like a tonne and make it last a couple of months.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:13):**  And for them, it's just a drop in the ocean.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:14):**  So that's really, that's really helpful too.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:18):**  Connie and Tom are clearly getting a lot of support from Balkaski, but that doesn't change  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:23):**  the fact that they're tenants of a huge estate.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:26):**  So what about the thorny question of land ownership?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:29):**  I think that's so important.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:32):**  And that's what in an ideal world, that's what we would want.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:35):**  You know, we really thought hard about if we do want to have our own place, how do we  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:41):**  do that?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:42):**  You know, buying land is so prohibitively expensive.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:46):**  And if you want to live on that land as well, you either have to buy a plot of land in the  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:50):**  hope that you'll get planning permission to build a house.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:53):**  We can't buy a house with land, that's just too expensive.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:56):**  But I'm not actually that bothered about building my own house.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:32:59):**  I just want to farm.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:01):**  So basically, young people, if you don't have loads of money to start out in Scotland anyway,  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:07):**  because land ownership is so concentrated in the hands of land owning estates, you know,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:11):**  those are the people who've got the land, those are the people you have to talk to.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:14):**  I don't expect any of them to sell us small bits of their estate.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:20):**  That's not what they want to do.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:21):**  They want to keep it all together.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:22):**  I would love to be able to do that.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:26):**  But that's not what they're going to do.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:28):**  And they've got the land.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:29):**  And if you want to start farming, that's just what we've had to do, just have to rent it  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:32):**  from them, and then try and live in a house nearby.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:35):**  Otherwise, you're just going to wait until you're 40 or 50 before you can start.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:39):**  And if more of us start doing that, you know, and have the conversation and talk about it,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:44):**  then that's moving forward.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:46):**  So that's what we'd had to decide to do in the end.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:49):**  It's what a lot of other people are doing as well.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:51):**  The strange thing about it in the end is that it depends on the personality so much.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:33:56):**  It's not like a structural solution or a way of sort of really organising society in the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:03):**  long term, if I can say that, but you sort of have to deal with what's there.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:09):**  And there's loads of benefits to that, you know, if we bought land by ourselves, then  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:14):**  we wouldn't have had any of the brilliant support we've had from the estate in terms  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:17):**  of the stuff I've already mentioned about the fencing and the water.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:20):**  And having Bauhaus here, you know, there's a market literally 100 metres from our door,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:25):**  and they've helped us in so many different ways.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:28):**  So actually, you know, there's pros and cons, and right now that's just the best.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:33):**  Yeah, right now the pros outweigh any bigger sort of ideological or political or practical  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:40):**  cons.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:41):**  They're just the day-to-day benefit of having that support and being part of a wider project  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:47):**  is massive.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:48):**  It's really, really helpful.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:49):**  There's always people around and people to talk to, so that's massive as well.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:34:56):**  Here's market and events manager Rosie Jack with her view of what the Bauhaus has achieved  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:01):**  so far and what the future holds for the project.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:05):**  I think it's made people more aware of what they're eating.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:07):**  I think it's kind of introduced the local area to lots of local producers that they  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:12):**  didn't even know were next door to them.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:14):**  There's still lots of work to do.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:16):**  There's still lots of sort of, oh, you're my next door neighbour.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:19):**  There's lots of those connections to make.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:21):**  But we've definitely kind of developed that relationship and helped small producers get  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:26):**  into the field.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:27):**  So we also have business gateway funding that we've just got another, very grateful for  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:32):**  another batch of money, and we're sort of funding new and local businesses, seasonal  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:36):**  businesses to be at the market, and they might not be able to afford that to start off.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:41):**  We also try and give them sort of any sort of training like social media, marketing,  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:46):**  anything like that that we can help with.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:48):**  We're trying to help lots of local businesses, and we've really seen that work and help them  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:52):**  get going and give them the confidence as well.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:54):**  I think that's quite important.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:35:55):**  I think us Scots don't like to blow our own trumpet a lot of the time, and I think giving  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:01):**  them the confidence to say, hey, look, I've got something really good here, and I worked  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:04):**  really hard on it, and actually it's brilliant, and I really want people to know about it.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:09):**  So giving them that platform as well and over the table top opportunities to speak to their  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:13):**  consumers straight away is so valuable and tell their story as well.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:17):**  The producers and the makers in Bo House are the main part of it, and I think really pushing  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:21):**  them forward is the next big step that I would like to do is building sort of a food club  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:25):**  up possibly, or even an assembly, a sort of a food assembly hub where people can come  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:31):**  and pick up their veg box.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:34):**  With that veg box, they can get their Scott and the Bread flour, and they can get it all  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:37):**  in one place, and they know that it's been basically grown and made in one place.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:42):**  That's what we'd love to do next.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:43):**  I want to get it right before we do it.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:45):**  I don't want to just throw it out there because I'm not sure that our followers are quite  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:48):**  ready for that yet.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:49):**  So making sure that people understand what we're trying to do and get on board with it,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:54):**  and I don't want it just to take off and then fizzle out.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:56):**  I think the longevity of it is actually more important.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:36:59):**  So that's hopefully coming, but again, lots of tinkering to do on that and get it right.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:04):**  Toby and Strother's view of the Bauhaus has changed since the project launched.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:08):**  I suppose I also naively thought that this would just be about sale of food and production  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:14):**  of food, and I probably underestimated the importance of the enjoyment of the process  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:21):**  of coming together and looking at and tasting and buying food.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:26):**  And so to recognize that Bauhaus, for it to be a day out, engaging with food is not a  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:32):**  bad thing, and that we need people who are coming out and engaging with food as well  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:37):**  as those people who are just coming out just to buy kale or just to buy wheat or what have  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:43):**  you.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:44):**  And so getting that fuller picture about how food engages and relates to the local community  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:50):**  takes time.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:51):**  And it also takes time.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:53):**  Some of our suppliers have started because of Bauhaus.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:37:55):**  It takes time for people to build up confidence to become a supplier anywhere, and including  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:01):**  with us, and to have a go.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:04):**  Because we've all been told that we're useless and that we need to leave food up to the big  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:08):**  businesses and that actually we can have a go.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:11):**  And it's not that complicated to bake bread or to make beer or to do anything else like  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:17):**  that.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:18):**  We can just have a go.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:19):**  And so it does take time, and it will continue to take time.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:22):**  But our experience so far with Bauhaus is it's given us the confidence to know that  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:25):**  that will happen and that the real job here is to provide the habitat in which that happens  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:32):**  and then to step back and let it be taken over.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:36):**  The Bauhaus model combines production space, regular markets, networking opportunities  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:41):**  and other support, all in an effort to rebuild the connections between producers and consumers.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:47):**  So is that a model that could work elsewhere?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:49):**  I think it's scalable.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:51):**  I think of it as being something that's open source.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:53):**  If anyone else wanted to come, I would gladly, gladly share our experiences of what we've  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:38:58):**  done, how it could be done better or cheaper or in different ways.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:03):**  There's a lot that I haven't learned yet about Bauhaus, so it's certainly not perfect.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:08):**  But I think the reemergence of local food hubs seem to be something that other people  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:13):**  are starting to look at as well.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:15):**  So it isn't something that can only be done here, or I'm not the only person doing it.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:20):**  And so there are lots of models out there.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:22):**  How they evolve over time, I don't know, but we need more of them and then we could all learn.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:29):**  And finally, an invitation from Toby for people to get involved.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:33):**  The only thing in a way is to encourage people to come forward with ideas, either for them  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:37):**  as makers or for them as consumers or for them as people who are interested in what  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:43):**  we're doing and the way that those separate elements of the food system are coming together  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:47):**  because we shouldn't have to, but we seem to be having to reinvent that part of the  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:52):**  structure.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:39:53):**  And so the more heads we have doing that, the better.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:01):**  These conversations were recorded long before the pandemic, at a time when it was still  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:05):**  possible to go to a busy market, sit down next to total strangers and eat food with  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:11):**  your hands.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:12):**  It's a strange thought.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:14):**  So I asked Rosie to give us an update on what's going on at the Bauhaus now.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:20):**  Morning Katie.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:21):**  I was just having a think about the questions you sent me.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:23):**  So the first one is what have been the main challenges of the last few months?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:29):**  And I think for Bauhaus, the main challenges have been that we've obviously had to cancel  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:34):**  our main events, our market weekends.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:37):**  This has been really hard because obviously we've seen our traders really sad.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:43):**  A lot of them are quite small traders.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:45):**  So the market weekends across Scotland are their kind of main route to market.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:51):**  A lot of them didn't have any e-commerce or online shops set up.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:56):**  So it was a real challenge for them actually.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:40:58):**  It was a difficult decision for us, but something we had to make.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:02):**  It's also been really hard not seeing any of our traders and any of our customers.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:06):**  Bauhaus is kind of all about that kind of coming together, sharing information and resources  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:11):**  and skills and hands-on skills as well.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:14):**  So it's been really difficult doing everything virtually, but a kind of good challenge as  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:19):**  well.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:20):**  It's something that we are moving towards anyway.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:23):**  It's opened up other opportunities for us to do new things.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:26):**  So your next question is how has Bauhaus responded to the situation?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:32):**  So as soon as lockdown hit, and actually before we were locked down in Scotland, we have talked  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:38):**  in the past about having an online shop for Bauhaus traders.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:43):**  Initially this was going to be for the Bauhaus businesses that are based on site.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:47):**  But actually we wanted to open this up to all the rest of our traders that come to our  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:51):**  events because we felt that it was really beneficial for them.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:41:55):**  So what we've done is we've partnered up with Open Food Network, which is an online shared  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:00):**  e-commerce platform.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:01):**  It's all open source.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:03):**  And what they do is they're like the host site where the kind of middleman, the traders  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:08):**  upload their stock and their products to the site.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:11):**  We create when the market's open so our customers can log on and buy produce from our traders.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:17):**  We do all the marketing.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:18):**  And then on the right day we pick and pack all the products once the stock's dropped  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:23):**  at Bauhaus and then we deliver to our customers as well as having a collection point from  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:28):**  Bauhaus as well.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:30):**  It's weekly.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:31):**  We wanted to make sure this was something that was regular enough to make an impact  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:35):**  on our local community.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:36):**  This has worked really well and we're really pleased with it.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:39):**  It's called Bauhaus Link and it's on the Open Food Network.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:41):**  So the next question is have you seen any changes or heard of anything that gives you  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:46):**  hope?  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:47):**  Yeah, definitely actually.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:49):**  We've kind of heard from a lot of our traders that they've been getting a lot of direct  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:53):**  sales from customers.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:55):**  Customers are kind of seeking out these traders and the products themselves.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:42:58):**  It's been really nice to see the support for local traders and local produce because obviously  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:05):**  the lack of events this year is going to massively impact on them.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:09):**  So yeah, hopefully this sort of change in the way we shop will continue and it's about  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:14):**  kind of keeping that momentum going I think and trying to find a way that once the lockdown  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:20):**  is lifted and it's obviously super easy to get food again that we can kind of keep the  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:23):**  ball rolling and keep people buying local and shopping local and working with traders  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:28):**  and eating within their community.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:31):**  The last question is just what else we'd like to say and I think it's important that people  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:36):**  know that Bauhaus Link and what we've set up in light of COVID-19, it's not going to  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:42):**  fade away overnight.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:43):**  We're not going to stop doing our online platform and online market after lockdown.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:50):**  It's something we want to continue working alongside the market weekends because Bauhaus  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:43:55):**  is all about being that place for food and drink producers to have a marketplace and  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:02):**  to sell to our community of followers and having that more regular rather than just  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:08):**  once a month at the market weekends, having it weekly, hopefully will continue to change  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:12):**  the way that people shop and eat food in our area.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:15):**  So yeah, it's going to work alongside it.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:18):**  Obviously when the market weekends open back up there's going to be lots of changes.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:22):**  We're going to obviously consider how the layout is.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:25):**  There might be some things we can't have like the street food area or maybe we can't have  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:31):**  live music or things like that.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:32):**  But information is coming at us all the time and it's always new so we're just trying to  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:37):**  make decisions on that information as it comes.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:40):**  So yeah, we just want to thank all of our customers for supporting us and obviously  
**[0:44:44-0:44:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:44):**  our traders at Bauhaus, the businesses that are based there are really thankful too.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:52):**  To find out more about the Bauhaus visit BauhausFyfe.com.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse#t=0:44:56):**  That's Bauhaus spelled B-O-W-H-O-U-S-E and Fyfe is F-I-F-E.

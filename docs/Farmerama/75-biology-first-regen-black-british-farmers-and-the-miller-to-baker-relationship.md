**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:01:54):**  for a long time.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:01:56):**  And we've always used his grain in conjunction with organic modern varieties.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:03):**  And initially we were getting organic modern flour from another supplier, but due to pallets  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:13):**  breaking, not arriving, being arriving in poor condition, John Letts suggested that

**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:25):**  Mill in a silo, and David could mill it fresh for us, and therefore deliver not only the  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:30):**  heritage flour, but all our flour.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:33):**  Initially taking on the work with Heritage Harvest and Kate was there to supplement as  
**[0:02:38-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:38):**  a business opportunity, but in the last five years, not only does it do that, it purely  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:47):**  keeps the water wheel going, which is obviously the heritage roots of the mill, which is something  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:53):**  I really want to keep going.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:02:55):**  But then you start to get involvement in the wheat, the grains, and understanding of them,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:01):**  and even more so this last few months with this war in Ukraine, I am completely convinced  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:07):**  it's the way forward because the fertilizer is not going to be available, and the climate  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:12):**  change we need to be looking at an alternative.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:19):**  It means that I have control over much more of the process, so I can identify the farmers  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:26):**  that I want to buy grain from, hopefully in the future have more of an influence over

**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:38):**  buy stored at David's, we know that that's there, so we're less vulnerable to fluctuations  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:45):**  in flour prices, or for example during the pandemic when there was a national flour shortage,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:54):**  we had this security because we knew that we had all of this grain in silo and that  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:03:58):**  it was just going to keep on coming because David was going to keep on milling it and  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:02):**  delivering it.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:03):**  The flour is also very fresh because David mills it the day before he delivers it, so  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:09):**  that's guaranteed, and there's just complete transparency in the whole process.

**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:22):**  businesses to combine with it and benefit them rather than the great big feed mills  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:27):**  that are taking over things.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:04:29):**  If we've got some good farmers, good land and good equipment, a little bit more understanding

**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:15:57):**  I would love you to talk a little bit about that and that finding and also what you recognised  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:02):**  in yourself as well or what you communicated.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:06):**  So I think there is this framing.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:09):**  We think of black communities as being mainly in cities, which they are, but the reasons  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:16):**  behind that are actually very structural.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:20):**  It's because that's where migrants were kind of put when they came to the UK and there's  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:28):**  a lot of racism that exists in rural spaces and there is this kind of historical narrative  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:35):**  around English culture which has this idea that diversity is a very new thing and that  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:43):**  historically everyone was white and that people very recently came here and kind of disturbed  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:49):**  that.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:50):**  That narrative is definitely there even though when I say it sounds very extreme.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:16:54):**  Actually that is really there in the way that like especially English culture I think is.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:00):**  But I had quite a strange experience I suppose when I was doing this research because I grew  
**[0:17:09-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:09):**  up in a rural area of the UK with a lot of privilege and I'm very light-skinned, mixed  
**[0:17:18-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:18):**  race and I realised that even I had kind of internalised that idea of black people being  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:28):**  exceptions in nature even though I as a black person had enjoyed this natural environment  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:36):**  for my whole life.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:38):**  I think it really made me realise quite how powerful those cultural narratives are that  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:43):**  I was kind of discovering them in myself and having to kind of check myself when people  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:47):**  I was speaking to were talking about their connection to and love of nature to really  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:52):**  like acknowledge that I was having this reaction as well of being like oh that's unusual when  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:17:59):**  it's really not.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:00):**  It's just that black people are kind of excluded actively from rural spaces which means that  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:06):**  you might not see black faces as much but that connection to nature is definitely not  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:11):**  lacking.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:13):**  Definitely I recognise it in myself as well that I 100% have believed that narrative for  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:19):**  many years and without even noticing that I'm believing it so I really appreciate you  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:26):**  drawing that out and reflecting back on all of us.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:31):**  Some of these things we don't even notice are written in our brains, in our culture  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:38):**  and how destructive they are actually as well.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:42):**  I think that's the other thing we have to acknowledge.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:45):**  What do you think this research tells us about the situation in the UK today?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:50):**  It demonstrates how little attention has been paid to black growers as a community from  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:18:59):**  like the wider alternative farming space.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:02):**  I think that it's come at a time where that attention is really picking up actually but  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:07):**  when I was doing my research it was really difficult because there was very little information.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:13):**  I think I found maybe two texts on black British growers in the UK.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:20):**  Obviously academic writing is not the only form of information but I think it is a good  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:25):**  snapshot into how much attention has been paid to that dynamic.

**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:42):**  as a new phenomenon.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:45):**  It's just that they haven't been given as much support and airtime as other alternative  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:52):**  farming spaces have.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:19:55):**  And I think although there are a relatively small number I think we need to recognise  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:00):**  that those traditions have been there for a really long time.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:04):**  Later on in the research you talk about within the international African diaspora providing  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:08):**  food for the black community has historical significance as a form of black resistance.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:13):**  The strong tradition of black people growing food in the UK is not simply a form of diasporic  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:17):**  reproduction of homeland conditions but it's something which is embedded in who we are.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:22):**  British black growers focus on self-preservation, unity and intergenerational learning.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:27):**  I don't know I just felt like a lot of very powerful words are used there and it does  
**[0:20:32-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:32):**  give this really strong visual of community and values.

**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:48):**  you felt and saw.

**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:20:58):**  I felt a real kind of flexibility and dynamic way of communicating and of learning that's  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:21:06):**  really it's actually not set in stone at all.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:21:10):**  And I think the traditions that I was learning about are very porous and the way that I was  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/75-biology-first-regen-black-british-farmers-and-the-miller-to-baker-relationship#t=0:21:18):**  being taught when I was like volunteering with people and kind of like learning about

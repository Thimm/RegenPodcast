**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:00):**  Cultivating justice, cultivating justice. Cultivating justice, cultivating justice.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:15):**  Justice, episode three.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:37):**  It has a taste of its own.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:39):**  It has a mealy taste, a mealy,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:42):**  nutty taste.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:43):**  And because one marinates it,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:45):**  it will then have a different twist to it.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:47):**  You can either steam it or lightly fry it with  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:50):**  whatever you want.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:51):**  We normally have another food called aki  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:54):**  and salt fish.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:55):**  You can have that with kalaloo.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:57):**  You can have that with red peppers,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:59):**  yellow peppers to give colour.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:01):**  And you salt and pepper it and then,  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:04):**  you know, marinate in the way you want to marinate it.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:07):**  But we normally have that in the morning  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:10):**  with maybe dumplings, green banana  
**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:14):**  and maybe yam.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:16):**  And depending on what you're going to do that day,  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:18):**  because if you've got to do a long day in Jamaica  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:21):**  on a farm, you'd need that to keep your stomach  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:24):**  for at least until, say, three, four o'clock in the afternoon.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:28):**  Here in the UK, people normally have it as a side compliment.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:33):**  It's designed to, I suppose, in a sense,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:36):**  give you that memory of being back home.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:38):**  What your parents have cooked and then you try to  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:41):**  continue with that heritage of having your own food.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome to Cultivating Justice.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:55):**  I'm Dora Taylor.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:57):**  I'm a food anthropologist, a researcher and an activist.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:00):**  I work for Farmerama and I'm also a chef.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:03):**  And I'm Sam Seva.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:04):**  I'm a grower, writer and organiser with London  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:07):**  Our Names.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:08):**  And the person we heard a moment ago was Glenda True.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:11):**  She's a workshop facilitator, a community grower  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:14):**  and a gardener who lives in London.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:16):**  We'll be hearing more from Glenda a bit later on.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:19):**  In this episode, we'll be exploring the links between  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:22):**  food, growing, history and identity.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:25):**  Last year, we published a zine called  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:27):**  Gordes, Banjoes and Callaloo by fellow lion babe  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:30):**  Marcus MacDonald.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:32):**  You can read it on Lion's website and you can hear  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:34):**  Marcus talk about Gordes and Banjoes on episode five  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:37):**  of this series.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:38):**  But we also thought Callaloo deserves a spotlight too.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:42):**  So what is Callaloo?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:44):**  In some places, it refers to a specific plant, Amaranth.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:48):**  But in other contexts, it can refer to lots of different  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:50):**  greens and it's more about the way you prepare them.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:53):**  If you can't get hold of Amaranth or a similar plant,  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:56):**  you can make other greens taste like Callaloo if you  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:58):**  prepare them in the same kind of way.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:00):**  And why does Callaloo matter?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:02):**  Why are we dedicating a whole episode to it?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:05):**  Well, I'm Jamaican British.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:07):**  I was born in Jamaica.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:08):**  And for me, cooking Jamaican food is a really important  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:11):**  way that I connect with my heritage, my family,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:14):**  my cultural roots.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:16):**  And Callaloo is a really special Jamaican food because  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:19):**  it's quite unassuming.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:21):**  If you saw it on a plate, you'd just think it was some  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:24):**  average steamed greens, but it's actually a very specific  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:27):**  dish. It tastes kind of rich, a bit nutty, and you often  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:32):**  put scotch bonnets or peppers or tomatoes with it.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:35):**  It's full of vitamins and iron and it's really, really  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:38):**  delicious.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:39):**  And if you're talking about growing culturally appropriate  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:41):**  food, Callaloo is one of the few Caribbean crops that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:44):**  actually grows really well in the UK's climate.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:47):**  So loads of Caribbean people in this country grow it in  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:49):**  their back gardens and allotments.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:51):**  But in the shops here, you can usually only buy it in a  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:54):**  tin imported from Jamaica.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:56):**  So we wanted to dedicate a whole episode to Callaloo  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:59):**  because for me, I think it really reflects the diasporic  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:02):**  experience.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:03):**  It's self-seeding, it flourishes, it adapts, it grows  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:07):**  even where it might not be welcome, but it persists and  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:10):**  it changes the spaces it's in for the better.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:13):**  There's another food that Glenda mentioned, ackee, that  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:16):**  we should maybe explain for anyone who doesn't know about  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:18):**  it. So ackee is a fruit, it grows on a tree and it looks  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:22):**  sort of like a pomegranate with a pinky yellow hard skin.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:27):**  But when it's ripe, it opens up sort of like a flower and  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:30):**  you can see the creamy yellow flesh inside.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:32):**  That's the bit that you eat.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:34):**  And it's got these huge black shiny seeds.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:37):**  It was brought to Jamaica from West Africa and like  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:40):**  Callaloo, it's a huge part of the Jamaican culture and  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:42):**  diet. It's one of the national dishes.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:45):**  It's got a really smooth, fragrant taste, but it's also  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:48):**  really savory.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:50):**  In my opinion, it's absolutely one of the most delicious  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:53):**  things to eat in the world.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:54):**  Another thing to mention is plantain, which is related to  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:58):**  bananas, but tastes better cooked.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:01):**  They're popular in the Caribbean, Central America and  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:04):**  in African food too.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:05):**  Depending on how ripe it is, the flavour can be more sweet  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:08):**  or savory.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:10):**  They're one of my favourite things to eat.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:12):**  So now we've introduced some of the delicious foods that  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:14):**  are mentioned. Let's get into the episode.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:17):**  So a while back, Dora came over to my house to cook up  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:19):**  some delicious vegan Callaloo recipes.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:22):**  So the first thing I'm going to make is just like a kind of  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:27):**  straightforward, plain Callaloo.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:29):**  I'm going to fry some onions and garlic and Scotch bonnet.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:33):**  And there's going to be some sweet pepper in there.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:36):**  And then we're actually going to use chard because fresh  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:41):**  Callaloo is like not necessarily hard to come by, but it  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:44):**  doesn't grow at this time of the year.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:45):**  And also I had some chard in my garden.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:49):**  Perfect.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:50):**  And Callaloo is sometimes used as just like a word for a  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:54):**  way to prepare greens.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:55):**  Like you can basically make the same thing with chard, even  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:59):**  if it's not what people traditionally think of as  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:02):**  Callaloo, which is amaranth.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:05):**  Just waiting for the oil to heat.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:07):**  And in Trinidad, apparently, according to Wikipedia, they  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:10):**  mainly use tower leaves and things like that.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:14):**  And in Jamaica, it's amaranth.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:16):**  You're making like a vegan Callaloo dish.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:20):**  Yeah, it's often made with saltfish.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:22):**  So I'm going to put some actually not in this one, but  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:25):**  in the fritters, I'm going to put some seaweed instead of  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:29):**  saltfish.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:30):**  Jamaicans cook a lot of things with saltfish.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:33):**  It's quite hard sometimes.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:36):**  Let's get the sizzle.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:38):**  No sizzle.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:42):**  It will sizzle in it.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:47):**  So Dora's putting in the saltfish.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:50):**  So Dora's putting in the onions and the scotch bonnet.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:00):**  And now the garlic.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:03):**  So we'll just like fry that for a bit.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:08):**  So was being vegan connected in any way to like sort of like  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:13):**  a cultural or like a political or like?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:16):**  When I decided to become vegan, it was like an environmental  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:20):**  decision.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:22):**  I've been vegan now for about five years.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:25):**  The longer I've kind of been vegan, the more I've actually  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:28):**  understood about the like cultural history of meat and  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:32):**  dairy free diets like ITAL.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:35):**  It's the diet that is like the traditional Rastafarian diet.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:39):**  If you are kind of very devout, I guess you don't eat anything  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:44):**  you don't eat anything processed and you also don't eat meat  
**[0:07:48-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:48):**  and dairy.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:48):**  So you traditionally wouldn't use salt or anything that you  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:53):**  can't like grow basically in your garden.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:57):**  It means that you can actually find a lot of vegan Jamaican  
**[0:08:00-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:00):**  food.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:01):**  And yeah, it's really amazing actually in Jamaica.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:04):**  Like when I was last there, I visited like they have an  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:08):**  indigenous Rasta community just near Montego Bay.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:13):**  And they held like open days every month where like anyone  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:17):**  can come and they do like cooking demonstrations there and  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:20):**  they just grow like everything.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:22):**  It's just like right there.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:24):**  I think maybe like 20 Rastas live there and they just have  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:27):**  like an ackee tree and they just have like all their greens  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:30):**  growing and they cook free food for everyone.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah, there's a lot of really nice ITAL food in London  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:37):**  actually, like you were saying, if you can find it.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah, and I heard recently that talking about Callaloo that  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:46):**  Peckham has like lots of self seeded Callaloo because so many  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:51):**  people grow it.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:52):**  So it's just like dispersed and I actually know people in  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:56):**  Peckham who grow it.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:57):**  So I'm not surprised and they don't even need to plant it  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:00):**  because it's self seed so much.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:02):**  So I don't know that's sort of like this beautiful thing of  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:05):**  like the Caribbean sort of ecological impact on that part  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:09):**  of London too, which is really cool.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:13):**  And I feel like, yeah, Callaloo for me is also like it's just  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:17):**  a very warming, healthy dish.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:20):**  It's like a more delicious spinach in my mind.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah, that's really beautiful.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:26):**  I love that that's happened in Peckham.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:29):**  And you don't really think about the kind of ecological impact  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:33):**  that communities have actually on an area.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:36):**  I guess maybe one of the few things that from the Caribbean  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:41):**  that actually grows really well here, like a lot of traditional  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:44):**  Caribbean food, you couldn't really grow it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:47):**  So like no wonder people are just like growing it in their  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:50):**  gardens.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:51):**  That's really amazing.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:52):**  In my mum's garden, she has loads of this weed called fat  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:58):**  hen, which in the first lockdown, I went and lived with her and  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:04):**  she'd like a bit, someone had told her basically that you could  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:07):**  cook it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:08):**  And so we cooked it and we were like, this is tastes exactly  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:10):**  like Callaloo.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:11):**  Obviously, we looked at it and it's like quite closely related  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:13):**  to amaranth.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:14):**  But it was like suddenly we just started seeing it everywhere  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:17):**  as like a weed.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:18):**  And it was like a really fun thing that we did.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:20):**  Yeah. In the lockdown to like discover that there was this  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:23):**  like Callaloo just growing in the garden.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:27):**  I'm going to add the peppers, I think.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:34):**  So what do you like to cook when you work as a chef?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:49):**  So I'm vegan, so all the food is vegan, but it's also I try  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:54):**  and do like seasonal stuff.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:58):**  I think there's like a lot of vegan food, which is actually  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:01):**  just like really processed and or made from like ingredients  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:05):**  that are like not necessarily very environmentally beneficial  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:11):**  or they've come from like miles away.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:13):**  So I try and like cook with ingredients that are growing in  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:17):**  the UK at the time.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:18):**  But then I was thinking when I was getting the ingredients  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:21):**  for today, I was like, it's obviously really difficult to  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:26):**  make Caribbean food with stuff that you can grow in the UK.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:31):**  And obviously a lot of food from a lot of cultures, like you  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:34):**  actually don't really have a choice but to buy food which  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:38):**  is flown from and like often you don't really know where  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:41):**  it's come from and like you don't really know the quality  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:43):**  of it.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:44):**  What do you cook with Callaloo?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:47):**  What do I cook?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:49):**  When I make Callaloo, I'll usually make like fried  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:53):**  dumplings and aki.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:56):**  I feel like almost every culture has their own dumpling  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:00):**  in a way like a dumpling like thing.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:03):**  But like Jamaican dumplings are really simple.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:07):**  And I think they're called Johnny cakes in other countries.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:11):**  I don't know.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:12):**  But it's basically just flour, water and salt.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:15):**  And then I use self-raising flour.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:17):**  So it like puffs up a little bit.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:20):**  And so I make that into a dough and then I'll fry that.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:23):**  And then aki, again, you can't grow aki in this climate.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:29):**  It also grows on a tree and you have to wait until it's  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:32):**  the fruit has opened to eat it because then it's poisonous  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:37):**  if it's not naturally opened.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:39):**  So you can only really get it in tins here as well.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, so I'll just like cook that with like tomatoes and  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:48):**  sweet pepper and onions and garlic and and time and so on.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:54):**  Yeah, sometimes I'll make fritters.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:56):**  Sometimes I'll make salt fish.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:58):**  Oh, sometimes I do like jerk tofu where like I marinate  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:03):**  tofu and like jerk seasoning and like with other things  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:08):**  like soy sauce or oil and other bits.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:11):**  Like I feel like my mom anyway, the way she makes Jamaican  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:14):**  food is that she puts soy sauce in almost everything.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:17):**  Like soy sauce is like actually a really key element  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:20):**  of Jamaican food.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:21):**  I don't know.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:22):**  There's a lot of Chinese people in Jamaica.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:25):**  Like there's a massive Chinese community there.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:27):**  So actually, I think the food has kind of really influenced  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:32):**  each other.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:34):**  Yeah, they really love soy sauce.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:37):**  And like I think that's the beautiful thing about Jamaican  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:40):**  food and maybe I'm not sure if it's the same for all over  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:43):**  the Caribbean.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:44):**  But what I always think about is like Jamaica is like  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:47):**  you can see in the food how all these different people  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:50):**  have come from different places and combine these different  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:55):**  ingredients and flavors to make something that's really  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:58):**  delicious.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:59):**  Like Aki is from West Africa.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:01):**  Like they brought the seeds and like I like to imagine  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:03):**  that it was like the enslaved workers like they brought  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:06):**  the seeds like braided in their hair or something like  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:09):**  you know, it was like a way of bringing some food there.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:12):**  But then also breadfruit is from Tahiti and like that  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:16):**  was brought over to feed enslaved workers and the first  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:19):**  generation of enslaved workers were like, what is this?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:21):**  I'm not going to eat it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:22):**  But now it's become such a big part of Jamaican food  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:26):**  as well.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:27):**  And then like salt fish is actually salted cod that is  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:30):**  caught in like Canadian waters and it's like this like,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:34):**  you know, cheap provisional food, but it's like a key  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:37):**  like part of Jamaican cuisine.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:39):**  Again, it's like these cheap provisions but then are  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:42):**  really like wholesome, heartwarming food, rice and  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:46):**  kidney beans, but like we call it peas.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:48):**  Like all beans are peas in Jamaica.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:51):**  All like chilies are peppers and like all spices,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:56):**  pimento and there's curries, there's all these different  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:00):**  elements and I feel like something you were saying before  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:03):**  about if you're from like a migrant community and like  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:06):**  maybe some of the ingredients that you need for like  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:10):**  making your traditional food aren't able to grow in  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:15):**  Britain and then like I don't think trade is bad.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:18):**  I feel like the current like systems of trade because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:21):**  they were built upon like this very extractive exploitative  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:24):**  systems and also systems are just geared towards like  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:27):**  profit and like cumulative growth.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:30):**  That's what's damaging the planet.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:32):**  It's not about the fact that getting some plantains  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:35):**  from like another country or like getting some vegetables  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:39):**  or plants or spices that you can't grow here.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:42):**  Like that's not a bad thing that's been happening for  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:45):**  as long as humans have been diasporas.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:47):**  We've always been trading with each other.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:49):**  It's just how we trade is the issue and like that's  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:51):**  something I always want to bring back when we start  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:53):**  thinking about like trying to be hyperlocal because I  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:56):**  think sometimes that can mean that we feel like we have  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:00):**  to close ourself off from so many other foods and flavors  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:02):**  and I just don't want to be eating turnips all through  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:06):**  the winter.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:07):**  Yeah, that was just something I wanted to say, but I  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:09):**  think it is important to like keep in mind.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:12):**  How does it look?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:13):**  Yeah, it's looking pretty good.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:15):**  Everything's looking really charred in a nice way.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:18):**  Brown and shiny.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:20):**  Yeah, and it's smelling really nice.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:23):**  Like the peppers have started to really soften and the  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:27):**  onions as well.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:28):**  So I think it might be time to add the greens.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:31):**  Yeah, we've also added some of the Caribbean all-purpose  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:36):**  seasoning, which is something that I also use a lot.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:40):**  It's really, really delicious.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:42):**  It's a staple.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:44):**  It's a staple.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:45):**  It's a staple.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:47):**  Okay, so we've just put in the chard.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:51):**  Gonna have a nice wilt down.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:55):**  Can't forget the thyme.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:56):**  Thyme is also like a really key ingredient for Jamaican  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:02):**  cooking.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:04):**  It's like the main herb.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:06):**  Yeah, it's like it's in absolutely everything.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:08):**  I love it.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:09):**  It's like so versatile.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:12):**  So the last time you were in Jamaica was 2019.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, I went to visit my dad for Christmas and I was  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:24):**  there for about three weeks.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:25):**  But I'd love to go for a longer amount of time.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:29):**  He was saying that you might be going for like a good  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:32):**  few months.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:33):**  I'd love to do that at some point because I've never  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:35):**  done that in my life since I left.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:39):**  I think it'd be really amazing to go for like three  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:41):**  or six months and actually live there properly.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah, I think it's sort of like a part of the diaspora  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:50):**  journey is like to also like reconnect to your heritage  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:55):**  in whatever ways and whether that's through food or  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:59):**  like visiting or other ways of engaging with the culture.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:03):**  Like I think it's something that so many of us are  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:06):**  trying to do in our own ways while also like similar  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:10):**  to like how Jamaican food is like this fusion of all  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:13):**  these different cultures where I think coming to like  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:17):**  Britain and also being able to interact especially in  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:20):**  London and places like that.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:22):**  Like you're constantly interacting with like lots of  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:24):**  different types of people and how that informs your  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:27):**  culture as well.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:28):**  Yeah, I totally get that.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:31):**  Okay, I've just added a load of time and I think it's  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:35):**  probably ready.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:36):**  Exciting.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:37):**  To eat.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:39):**  Hello.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:40):**  So we're going to eat.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:44):**  You go ahead.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:45):**  Yeah, cool.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:46):**  It looks really beautiful.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:48):**  It's very colourful like the dark greens and the bright  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:52):**  reds of the sweet pepper all contrasting.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:56):**  I love how colourful I think the sweet pepper like half  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:00):**  of the reason you use it is because it makes it look  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:03):**  really colourful.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:04):**  How spicy is it?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:05):**  Not spicy at all.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:06):**  Really?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah, we could add more.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, we've got a lot.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:09):**  We've got four bottles of hot sauce sitting in front  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:11):**  of us.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:12):**  I actually am going to have some of this walkers wood.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:14):**  Yeah, it's a classic.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:15):**  It's a classic and I don't have any of my fridge at  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:18):**  the moment.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:19):**  Yeah, just treat yourself.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:20):**  So I'm going to have a little drop.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:22):**  The roti stuff one is really spicy.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:24):**  So I have to be really like controlled.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:26):**  Yeah, I quite often overuse the it's like this really  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:30):**  beautiful yellow colour and it's very fruity.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:33):**  That one is made in Jamaica.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:35):**  I think.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:38):**  Walkers wood is actually a farmers co-op as well.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:41):**  Is it?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:43):**  That's really cool.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:45):**  And it has like the best packaging.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:47):**  It's like this Rastaman kneeling over a drum breathing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:51):**  fire in like a starry night sky.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:54):**  It's art.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:57):**  So yeah, I think the chard is like it works.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:01):**  Yeah, it does work, doesn't it?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:04):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:06):**  I feel like Kalulu has like almost a bit more of a  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:10):**  bitter taste than chard in a way.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah, it's a little bit more delicate.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:15):**  But like, you know, it gets like that a little more  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:18):**  like silky wiltedness.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:20):**  Yeah, like chard has is more like chewy, but still  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:23):**  delicious.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:24):**  Yeah, good way to cook chard.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:26):**  There was one point where I just had so much chard  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:28):**  that I was like running out of recipes.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:33):**  That's really nice.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:35):**  Mm hmm.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:05):**  You always yearn and try to find your food.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:25):**  And obviously it's very difficult to grow up here,  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:28):**  but people are always seeking to grow food from home.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:33):**  Whether it be green bananas or a banana, we got okra,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:38):**  Kalulu, chocho, which is another one, and many, many  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:42):**  things.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:43):**  We always try to seek to develop the growing of that  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:47):**  food.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:48):**  Sweet potato.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:49):**  I tried last year and I got four very large sweet  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:53):**  potatoes.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:54):**  And from that, I'm growing the slips.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:57):**  And I've now spoken to a few people within the sort  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:00):**  of community group and they've got slips.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:02):**  And so you've got what have you got?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:04):**  You've got this and that.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:05):**  How does that one grow?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:06):**  It grows like this.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:07):**  And then you then start to partake in handing around  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:10):**  those seeds or slips or plants.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:13):**  I'm open to showing anyone what to grow and how to  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:16):**  grow.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:18):**  First time I grew Kalulu would have been about five  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:21):**  years ago, five years ago.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:23):**  My first experience, I threw too many seeds out and  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:26):**  they did come in bunches.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:28):**  I was able to weed some, but not many.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:31):**  And obviously the following year when they seeded,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:34):**  wow, it's even worse.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:36):**  There was a cluster of them and I got to them when  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:39):**  they were very, very healthy.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:42):**  Some were fat, some were very, very thin.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:44):**  Obviously the thin one is where they were competing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:46):**  with each other.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:47):**  But I did get a good crop out of that.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:50):**  Buying Kalulu, it is expensive.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:53):**  And people always try to find Kalulu wherever they  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:56):**  can.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:57):**  People love it.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:58):**  People hunt it down.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:59):**  We have to grow it because it becomes like a  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:02):**  delicacy.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:03):**  It becomes expensive.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:05):**  I very rarely seed in the market, very, very rarely.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:09):**  I think people individually hand it around to their  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:12):**  households, to friends and family rather than sell  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:15):**  it because it's a rare commodity in that sense.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:18):**  So we don't abuse it by trying to sell it.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:22):**  Seeds are available.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:23):**  You can purchase them, but they're very expensive.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:26):**  Make sure that you do save your seeds and hand them  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:30):**  around.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:31):**  You can give a thousand seeds or more to your  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:34):**  neighbour on the allotment.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:36):**  You can start off eating April.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:39):**  You sprinkle, you broadcast.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:41):**  Don't broadcast too many seeds.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:44):**  Obviously the seeds would compete with each other  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:46):**  and it will, as I say, will bunch up in clusters.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:51):**  And so you would have to sort of weed a few of them  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:53):**  out.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:54):**  So about July, August, you'd be able to start reaping  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:58):**  the benefits of harvesting, as I say, the canneloo.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:02):**  It's cut and come again in effect.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:04):**  After a while, towards the end of September, October,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:07):**  it will start getting very woody.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:09):**  So towards the end of, say, September, October, the  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:14):**  flower heads will be coming out.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:16):**  When you do get your harvest, you'd get millions,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:20):**  literally millions on the heads day.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:22):**  When they do bolt, they come into a fluffy head,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:27):**  light fluffy head.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:29):**  Try to pick them off on a dry day.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:32):**  Other than one head, you get a thousand.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:34):**  So you've got a whole lot, let's say 30 or 40 plants.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:38):**  You could imagine how many seed heads you can get  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:40):**  from them.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:41):**  And so you tap them out, let them dry as well.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:44):**  They are very prolific.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:46):**  You'd never, ever, ever have to find another packet  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:50):**  of seed again.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:51):**  I would advise anyone to, you know, if they want canneloo,  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:55):**  you know, grow it.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:04):**  So I've made the mix for the fritters, which is gram  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:09):**  flour, which is chickpea flour, some water and some  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:14):**  onions and some all purpose seasoning.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:19):**  And for this, I've used like a tin of canneloo that  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:23):**  you get in the shop, which is usually how I get canneloo  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:28):**  here.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:29):**  Often these fritters will be made with saltfish, but  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:33):**  I've added some seaweed to give a similar flavour.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:36):**  I saw a recipe for like dumplings once where they put  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:40):**  like butter and like loads of other stuff in it.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:42):**  And I was like, wait, wait, wait.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:44):**  No, no, this is wrong.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:47):**  Don't claim this is Jamaican or something.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:50):**  This is offensive.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:52):**  I feel like the point of dumplings is that they're like  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:54):**  quite simple to make.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:56):**  Yeah, they were like saying, need, leave it right.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:00):**  And I was like, this is not, no, this isn't, it's not bread.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:03):**  It's literally like fried dough.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:07):**  Okay, I think, yeah, give it a go.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:09):**  The oil is hot.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:11):**  I'm going to get a spoon.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:17):**  Amazing.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:19):**  Okay, I'm just dropping like a spoonful of the  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:23):**  batter into, we've got like quite a lot of oil.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:26):**  We're kind of deep frying them.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:28):**  That's making a really nice sound.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:38):**  Let's wait a bit.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:49):**  Okay, so Dora has made the fritters.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:56):**  They're looking really nice and crispy.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:59):**  Green.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah, really green from the kalaloo and probably the seaweed as well.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:04):**  They also smell really fishy.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:07):**  Which is good.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:08):**  Yeah, so we're going to eat some of them with the charred kalaloo dish.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:13):**  Maybe some hot sauce.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:14):**  Definitely.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:15):**  I was just thinking that.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:19):**  So good.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:20):**  Like really crispy and on the outside, but like soft and  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah, they turned out well actually.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:28):**  Really good.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:29):**  Yeah, really good flavour.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:31):**  I love ground flour.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:33):**  I feel like it just like gives a really nice like stickiness of things.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:38):**  They go well together.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah, really good.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:41):**  Glenda told us that she got into growing pretty much by accident in her late 30s.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:46):**  She chucked out some vegetable scraps in her garden, including some tomatoes,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:50):**  and she dug them into the soil.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:52):**  After a while, of course, they started sprouting.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:55):**  And so Glenda picked them out and transplanted them.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:58):**  And that's how it all started.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:59):**  She's also massively into growing vegetables.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:02):**  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:04):**  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:06):**  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:08):**  And that's how it all started. She's also massively into composting.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:12):**  She calls it a beautiful science.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:14):**  Glenda is now involved with ITAL garden.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:16):**  That's how Dora heard about her.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:18):**  It's an Afro diaspora led community garden in Lewisham, southeast London,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:22):**  which was set up by a group called Cocoa Collective.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:26):**  They grow culturally diverse foods and healing herbs.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:29):**  And they also run workshops in arts and crafts, mental and physical health and food growing.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:34):**  It's an intergenerational space and it's open to everyone.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:37):**  So AITAL is a group of African and Caribbean people who want to learn how to grow, I say  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:45):**  our food, say tropical food. I was invited, would you like to assist us in a few workshops?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:52):**  The first workshop was just potting up seeds and they were quite excited. They're very  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:59):**  young, they're only I think a year old and they're doing quite a lot for the community.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:04):**  I think they're there every Wednesday and Sunday, weeding, turning the compost, they're  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:10):**  germinating their seeds for the very first time. It's a good feeling on the one hand,  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:16):**  but then I feel quite sad that this should have been done many, many years ago. Growing  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:21):**  your culture specific food is a warm feeling. The AITAL group is bringing younger people  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:27):**  to the allotment and sharing the information. Many of them would not be living in say,  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:34):**  houses, they're living in large estates and so forth and not have gardens per se. So it's  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:41):**  our duty to show them how to start with growing food and having small gardens as they would  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:48):**  have back home. And many of them are bringing seeds to us. A lady from Zimbabwe would have  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:53):**  very unusual seeds, but you'd need like a greenhouse, warm heaters and so forth. Very  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:59):**  large, extensive resources to bring forth what you really wanted to bring forth. There's  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:30:06):**  only a few things you can grow, but one of them is callaloo, which is doing quite well,  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:30:12):**  I think, in this country. It would be one of the plants that would be on every African  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:30:17):**  Caribbean allotment. It is their first year, so I'm hoping that they'll see this year in  
**[0:30:24-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:30:24):**  its plenty. You can find out more about AITAL Garden on Instagram at cococollective.org

### Farmerama  (2022-07-10)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:00):**  Cultivating justice, cultivating justice. Cultivating justice, cultivating justice.  Justice, episode three.  It has a taste of its own.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:39):**  It has a mealy taste, a mealy,  nutty taste.  And because one marinates it,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:45):**  it will then have a different twist to it.  You can either steam it or lightly fry it with  whatever you want.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:51):**  We normally have another food called aki  and salt fish.  You can have that with kalaloo.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:00:57):**  You can have that with red peppers,  yellow peppers to give colour.  And you salt and pepper it and then,  
**[0:01:04-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:04):**  you know, marinate in the way you want to marinate it.  But we normally have that in the morning  with maybe dumplings, green banana  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:14):**  and maybe yam.  And depending on what you're going to do that day,  because if you've got to do a long day in Jamaica  
**[0:01:21-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:21):**  on a farm, you'd need that to keep your stomach  for at least until, say, three, four o'clock in the afternoon.  Here in the UK, people normally have it as a side compliment.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:33):**  It's designed to, I suppose, in a sense,  give you that memory of being back home.  What your parents have cooked and then you try to  
**[0:01:41-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:41):**  continue with that heritage of having your own food.  Welcome to Cultivating Justice.  I'm Dora Taylor.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:01:57):**  I'm a food anthropologist, a researcher and an activist.  I work for Farmerama and I'm also a chef.  And I'm Sam Seva.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:04):**  I'm a grower, writer and organiser with London  Our Names.  And the person we heard a moment ago was Glenda True.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:11):**  She's a workshop facilitator, a community grower  and a gardener who lives in London.  We'll be hearing more from Glenda a bit later on.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:19):**  In this episode, we'll be exploring the links between  food, growing, history and identity.  Last year, we published a zine called  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:27):**  Gordes, Banjoes and Callaloo by fellow lion babe  Marcus MacDonald.  You can read it on Lion's website and you can hear  
**[0:02:34-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:34):**  Marcus talk about Gordes and Banjoes on episode five  of this series.  But we also thought Callaloo deserves a spotlight too.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:42):**  So what is Callaloo?  In some places, it refers to a specific plant, Amaranth.  But in other contexts, it can refer to lots of different  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:50):**  greens and it's more about the way you prepare them.  If you can't get hold of Amaranth or a similar plant,  you can make other greens taste like Callaloo if you  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:02:58):**  prepare them in the same kind of way.  And why does Callaloo matter?  Why are we dedicating a whole episode to it?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:05):**  Well, I'm Jamaican British.  I was born in Jamaica.  And for me, cooking Jamaican food is a really important  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:11):**  way that I connect with my heritage, my family,  my cultural roots.  And Callaloo is a really special Jamaican food because  
**[0:03:19-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:19):**  it's quite unassuming.  If you saw it on a plate, you'd just think it was some  average steamed greens, but it's actually a very specific  
**[0:03:27-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:27):**  dish. It tastes kind of rich, a bit nutty, and you often  put scotch bonnets or peppers or tomatoes with it.  It's full of vitamins and iron and it's really, really  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:38):**  delicious.  And if you're talking about growing culturally appropriate  food, Callaloo is one of the few Caribbean crops that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:44):**  actually grows really well in the UK's climate.  So loads of Caribbean people in this country grow it in  their back gardens and allotments.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:51):**  But in the shops here, you can usually only buy it in a  tin imported from Jamaica.  So we wanted to dedicate a whole episode to Callaloo  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:03:59):**  because for me, I think it really reflects the diasporic  experience.  It's self-seeding, it flourishes, it adapts, it grows  
**[0:04:07-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:07):**  even where it might not be welcome, but it persists and  it changes the spaces it's in for the better.  There's another food that Glenda mentioned, ackee, that  
**[0:04:16-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:16):**  we should maybe explain for anyone who doesn't know about  it. So ackee is a fruit, it grows on a tree and it looks  sort of like a pomegranate with a pinky yellow hard skin.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:27):**  But when it's ripe, it opens up sort of like a flower and  you can see the creamy yellow flesh inside.  That's the bit that you eat.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:34):**  And it's got these huge black shiny seeds.  It was brought to Jamaica from West Africa and like  Callaloo, it's a huge part of the Jamaican culture and  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:42):**  diet. It's one of the national dishes.  It's got a really smooth, fragrant taste, but it's also  really savory.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:50):**  In my opinion, it's absolutely one of the most delicious  things to eat in the world.  Another thing to mention is plantain, which is related to  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:04:58):**  bananas, but tastes better cooked.  They're popular in the Caribbean, Central America and  in African food too.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:05):**  Depending on how ripe it is, the flavour can be more sweet  or savory.  They're one of my favourite things to eat.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:12):**  So now we've introduced some of the delicious foods that  are mentioned. Let's get into the episode.  So a while back, Dora came over to my house to cook up  
**[0:05:19-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:19):**  some delicious vegan Callaloo recipes.  So the first thing I'm going to make is just like a kind of  straightforward, plain Callaloo.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:29):**  I'm going to fry some onions and garlic and Scotch bonnet.  And there's going to be some sweet pepper in there.  And then we're actually going to use chard because fresh  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:41):**  Callaloo is like not necessarily hard to come by, but it  doesn't grow at this time of the year.  And also I had some chard in my garden.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:49):**  Perfect.  And Callaloo is sometimes used as just like a word for a  way to prepare greens.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:05:55):**  Like you can basically make the same thing with chard, even  if it's not what people traditionally think of as  Callaloo, which is amaranth.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:05):**  Just waiting for the oil to heat.  Yeah.  And in Trinidad, apparently, according to Wikipedia, they  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:10):**  mainly use tower leaves and things like that.  And in Jamaica, it's amaranth.  You're making like a vegan Callaloo dish.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:20):**  Yeah, it's often made with saltfish.  So I'm going to put some actually not in this one, but  in the fritters, I'm going to put some seaweed instead of  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:29):**  saltfish.  Jamaicans cook a lot of things with saltfish.  It's quite hard sometimes.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:36):**  Let's get the sizzle.  No sizzle.  It will sizzle in it.  
**[0:06:47-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:06:47):**  So Dora's putting in the saltfish.  So Dora's putting in the onions and the scotch bonnet.  And now the garlic.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:03):**  So we'll just like fry that for a bit.  So was being vegan connected in any way to like sort of like  a cultural or like a political or like?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:16):**  When I decided to become vegan, it was like an environmental  decision.  I've been vegan now for about five years.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:25):**  The longer I've kind of been vegan, the more I've actually  understood about the like cultural history of meat and  dairy free diets like ITAL.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:35):**  It's the diet that is like the traditional Rastafarian diet.  If you are kind of very devout, I guess you don't eat anything  you don't eat anything processed and you also don't eat meat  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:48):**  and dairy.  So you traditionally wouldn't use salt or anything that you  can't like grow basically in your garden.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:07:57):**  It means that you can actually find a lot of vegan Jamaican  food.  And yeah, it's really amazing actually in Jamaica.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:04):**  Like when I was last there, I visited like they have an  indigenous Rasta community just near Montego Bay.  And they held like open days every month where like anyone  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:17):**  can come and they do like cooking demonstrations there and  they just grow like everything.  It's just like right there.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:24):**  I think maybe like 20 Rastas live there and they just have  like an ackee tree and they just have like all their greens  growing and they cook free food for everyone.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah, there's a lot of really nice ITAL food in London  actually, like you were saying, if you can find it.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah, and I heard recently that talking about Callaloo that  Peckham has like lots of self seeded Callaloo because so many  people grow it.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:08:52):**  So it's just like dispersed and I actually know people in  Peckham who grow it.  So I'm not surprised and they don't even need to plant it  
**[0:09:00-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:00):**  because it's self seed so much.  So I don't know that's sort of like this beautiful thing of  like the Caribbean sort of ecological impact on that part  
**[0:09:09-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:09):**  of London too, which is really cool.  And I feel like, yeah, Callaloo for me is also like it's just  a very warming, healthy dish.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:20):**  It's like a more delicious spinach in my mind.  Yeah, that's really beautiful.  I love that that's happened in Peckham.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:29):**  And you don't really think about the kind of ecological impact  that communities have actually on an area.  I guess maybe one of the few things that from the Caribbean  
**[0:09:41-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:41):**  that actually grows really well here, like a lot of traditional  Caribbean food, you couldn't really grow it.  So like no wonder people are just like growing it in their  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:50):**  gardens.  That's really amazing.  In my mum's garden, she has loads of this weed called fat  
**[0:09:58-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:09:58):**  hen, which in the first lockdown, I went and lived with her and  she'd like a bit, someone had told her basically that you could  cook it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:08):**  And so we cooked it and we were like, this is tastes exactly  like Callaloo.  Obviously, we looked at it and it's like quite closely related  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:13):**  to amaranth.  But it was like suddenly we just started seeing it everywhere  as like a weed.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:18):**  And it was like a really fun thing that we did.  Yeah. In the lockdown to like discover that there was this  like Callaloo just growing in the garden.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:26):**  Yeah.  I'm going to add the peppers, I think.  So what do you like to cook when you work as a chef?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:49):**  So I'm vegan, so all the food is vegan, but it's also I try  and do like seasonal stuff.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:10:58):**  I think there's like a lot of vegan food, which is actually  just like really processed and or made from like ingredients  that are like not necessarily very environmentally beneficial  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:11):**  or they've come from like miles away.  So I try and like cook with ingredients that are growing in  the UK at the time.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:18):**  But then I was thinking when I was getting the ingredients  for today, I was like, it's obviously really difficult to  make Caribbean food with stuff that you can grow in the UK.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:31):**  And obviously a lot of food from a lot of cultures, like you  actually don't really have a choice but to buy food which  is flown from and like often you don't really know where  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:41):**  it's come from and like you don't really know the quality  of it.  What do you cook with Callaloo?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:47):**  What do I cook?  Yeah.  When I make Callaloo, I'll usually make like fried  
**[0:11:53-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:11:53):**  dumplings and aki.  I feel like almost every culture has their own dumpling  in a way like a dumpling like thing.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:03):**  But like Jamaican dumplings are really simple.  And I think they're called Johnny cakes in other countries.  I don't know.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:12):**  But it's basically just flour, water and salt.  And then I use self-raising flour.  So it like puffs up a little bit.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:20):**  And so I make that into a dough and then I'll fry that.  And then aki, again, you can't grow aki in this climate.  It also grows on a tree and you have to wait until it's  
**[0:12:32-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:32):**  the fruit has opened to eat it because then it's poisonous  if it's not naturally opened.  So you can only really get it in tins here as well.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, so I'll just like cook that with like tomatoes and  sweet pepper and onions and garlic and and time and so on.  Yeah, sometimes I'll make fritters.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:12:56):**  Sometimes I'll make salt fish.  Oh, sometimes I do like jerk tofu where like I marinate  tofu and like jerk seasoning and like with other things  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:08):**  like soy sauce or oil and other bits.  Like I feel like my mom anyway, the way she makes Jamaican  food is that she puts soy sauce in almost everything.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:17):**  Like soy sauce is like actually a really key element  of Jamaican food.  I don't know.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:22):**  There's a lot of Chinese people in Jamaica.  Like there's a massive Chinese community there.  So actually, I think the food has kind of really influenced  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:32):**  each other.  Yeah.  Yeah, they really love soy sauce.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:36):**  Yeah.  And like I think that's the beautiful thing about Jamaican  food and maybe I'm not sure if it's the same for all over  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:43):**  the Caribbean.  But what I always think about is like Jamaica is like  you can see in the food how all these different people  
**[0:13:50-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:50):**  have come from different places and combine these different  ingredients and flavors to make something that's really  delicious.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:13:59):**  Like Aki is from West Africa.  Like they brought the seeds and like I like to imagine  that it was like the enslaved workers like they brought  
**[0:14:06-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:06):**  the seeds like braided in their hair or something like  you know, it was like a way of bringing some food there.  But then also breadfruit is from Tahiti and like that  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:16):**  was brought over to feed enslaved workers and the first  generation of enslaved workers were like, what is this?  I'm not going to eat it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:22):**  But now it's become such a big part of Jamaican food  as well.  And then like salt fish is actually salted cod that is  
**[0:14:30-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:30):**  caught in like Canadian waters and it's like this like,  you know, cheap provisional food, but it's like a key  like part of Jamaican cuisine.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:39):**  Again, it's like these cheap provisions but then are  really like wholesome, heartwarming food, rice and  kidney beans, but like we call it peas.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:14:48):**  Like all beans are peas in Jamaica.  All like chilies are peppers and like all spices,  pimento and there's curries, there's all these different  
**[0:15:00-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:00):**  elements and I feel like something you were saying before  about if you're from like a migrant community and like  maybe some of the ingredients that you need for like  
**[0:15:10-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:10):**  making your traditional food aren't able to grow in  Britain and then like I don't think trade is bad.  I feel like the current like systems of trade because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:21):**  they were built upon like this very extractive exploitative  systems and also systems are just geared towards like  profit and like cumulative growth.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:30):**  That's what's damaging the planet.  It's not about the fact that getting some plantains  from like another country or like getting some vegetables  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:39):**  or plants or spices that you can't grow here.  Like that's not a bad thing that's been happening for  as long as humans have been diasporas.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:47):**  We've always been trading with each other.  It's just how we trade is the issue and like that's  something I always want to bring back when we start  
**[0:15:53-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:15:53):**  thinking about like trying to be hyperlocal because I  think sometimes that can mean that we feel like we have  to close ourself off from so many other foods and flavors  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:02):**  and I just don't want to be eating turnips all through  the winter.  Yeah, that was just something I wanted to say, but I  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:09):**  think it is important to like keep in mind.  How does it look?  Yeah, it's looking pretty good.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:15):**  Everything's looking really charred in a nice way.  Brown and shiny.  Yeah, and it's smelling really nice.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:23):**  Like the peppers have started to really soften and the  onions as well.  So I think it might be time to add the greens.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:31):**  Yeah, we've also added some of the Caribbean all-purpose  seasoning, which is something that I also use a lot.  It's really, really delicious.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:42):**  It's a staple.  It's a staple.  It's a staple.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:46):**  Yeah.  Okay, so we've just put in the chard.  Gonna have a nice wilt down.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:16:55):**  Can't forget the thyme.  Thyme is also like a really key ingredient for Jamaican  cooking.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:04):**  It's like the main herb.  Yeah, it's like it's in absolutely everything.  I love it.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:09):**  It's like so versatile.  So the last time you were in Jamaica was 2019.  Yes.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, I went to visit my dad for Christmas and I was  there for about three weeks.  But I'd love to go for a longer amount of time.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:29):**  He was saying that you might be going for like a good  few months.  I'd love to do that at some point because I've never  
**[0:17:35-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:35):**  done that in my life since I left.  I think it'd be really amazing to go for like three  or six months and actually live there properly.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah, I think it's sort of like a part of the diaspora  journey is like to also like reconnect to your heritage  in whatever ways and whether that's through food or  
**[0:17:59-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:17:59):**  like visiting or other ways of engaging with the culture.  Like I think it's something that so many of us are  trying to do in our own ways while also like similar  
**[0:18:10-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:10):**  to like how Jamaican food is like this fusion of all  these different cultures where I think coming to like  Britain and also being able to interact especially in  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:20):**  London and places like that.  Like you're constantly interacting with like lots of  different types of people and how that informs your  
**[0:18:27-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:27):**  culture as well.  Yeah, I totally get that.  Okay, I've just added a load of time and I think it's  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:35):**  probably ready.  Exciting.  To eat.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:38):**  Yeah.  Hello.  So we're going to eat.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:44):**  You go ahead.  Yeah, cool.  It looks really beautiful.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:48):**  It's very colourful like the dark greens and the bright  reds of the sweet pepper all contrasting.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:18:56):**  I love how colourful I think the sweet pepper like half  of the reason you use it is because it makes it look  really colourful.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:04):**  How spicy is it?  Not spicy at all.  Really?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah, we could add more.  Yeah, we've got a lot.  We've got four bottles of hot sauce sitting in front  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:11):**  of us.  I actually am going to have some of this walkers wood.  Yeah, it's a classic.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:15):**  It's a classic and I don't have any of my fridge at  the moment.  Yeah, just treat yourself.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:20):**  So I'm going to have a little drop.  The roti stuff one is really spicy.  So I have to be really like controlled.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:26):**  Yeah, I quite often overuse the it's like this really  beautiful yellow colour and it's very fruity.  That one is made in Jamaica.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:35):**  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:38):**  Walkers wood is actually a farmers co-op as well.  Is it?  Yeah.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:43):**  That's really cool.  And it has like the best packaging.  It's like this Rastaman kneeling over a drum breathing  
**[0:19:51-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:19:51):**  fire in like a starry night sky.  It's art.  So yeah, I think the chard is like it works.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:01):**  Yeah, it does work, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:06):**  I feel like Kalulu has like almost a bit more of a  bitter taste than chard in a way.  Yeah, it's a little bit more delicate.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:15):**  But like, you know, it gets like that a little more  like silky wiltedness.  Yeah, like chard has is more like chewy, but still  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:23):**  delicious.  Yeah, good way to cook chard.  There was one point where I just had so much chard  
**[0:20:28-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:20:28):**  that I was like running out of recipes.  That's really nice.  Mm hmm.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:05):**  You always yearn and try to find your food.  And obviously it's very difficult to grow up here,  but people are always seeking to grow food from home.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:33):**  Whether it be green bananas or a banana, we got okra,  Kalulu, chocho, which is another one, and many, many  things.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:43):**  We always try to seek to develop the growing of that  food.  Sweet potato.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:49):**  I tried last year and I got four very large sweet  potatoes.  And from that, I'm growing the slips.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:21:57):**  And I've now spoken to a few people within the sort  of community group and they've got slips.  And so you've got what have you got?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:04):**  You've got this and that.  How does that one grow?  It grows like this.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:07):**  And then you then start to partake in handing around  those seeds or slips or plants.  I'm open to showing anyone what to grow and how to  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:16):**  grow.  First time I grew Kalulu would have been about five  years ago, five years ago.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:23):**  My first experience, I threw too many seeds out and  they did come in bunches.  I was able to weed some, but not many.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:31):**  And obviously the following year when they seeded,  wow, it's even worse.  There was a cluster of them and I got to them when  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:39):**  they were very, very healthy.  Some were fat, some were very, very thin.  Obviously the thin one is where they were competing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:46):**  with each other.  But I did get a good crop out of that.  Buying Kalulu, it is expensive.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:53):**  And people always try to find Kalulu wherever they  can.  People love it.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:22:58):**  People hunt it down.  We have to grow it because it becomes like a  delicacy.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:03):**  It becomes expensive.  I very rarely seed in the market, very, very rarely.  I think people individually hand it around to their  
**[0:23:12-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:12):**  households, to friends and family rather than sell  it because it's a rare commodity in that sense.  So we don't abuse it by trying to sell it.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:22):**  Seeds are available.  You can purchase them, but they're very expensive.  Make sure that you do save your seeds and hand them  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:30):**  around.  You can give a thousand seeds or more to your  neighbour on the allotment.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:36):**  You can start off eating April.  You sprinkle, you broadcast.  Don't broadcast too many seeds.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:44):**  Obviously the seeds would compete with each other  and it will, as I say, will bunch up in clusters.  And so you would have to sort of weed a few of them  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:23:53):**  out.  So about July, August, you'd be able to start reaping  the benefits of harvesting, as I say, the canneloo.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:02):**  It's cut and come again in effect.  After a while, towards the end of September, October,  it will start getting very woody.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:09):**  So towards the end of, say, September, October, the  flower heads will be coming out.  When you do get your harvest, you'd get millions,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:20):**  literally millions on the heads day.  When they do bolt, they come into a fluffy head,  light fluffy head.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:29):**  Try to pick them off on a dry day.  Other than one head, you get a thousand.  So you've got a whole lot, let's say 30 or 40 plants.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:38):**  You could imagine how many seed heads you can get  from them.  And so you tap them out, let them dry as well.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:44):**  They are very prolific.  You'd never, ever, ever have to find another packet  of seed again.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:24:51):**  I would advise anyone to, you know, if they want canneloo,  you know, grow it.  So I've made the mix for the fritters, which is gram  
**[0:25:09-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:09):**  flour, which is chickpea flour, some water and some  onions and some all purpose seasoning.  And for this, I've used like a tin of canneloo that  
**[0:25:23-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:23):**  you get in the shop, which is usually how I get canneloo  here.  Often these fritters will be made with saltfish, but  
**[0:25:33-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:33):**  I've added some seaweed to give a similar flavour.  I saw a recipe for like dumplings once where they put  like butter and like loads of other stuff in it.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:42):**  And I was like, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, this is wrong.  Don't claim this is Jamaican or something.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:50):**  This is offensive.  I feel like the point of dumplings is that they're like  quite simple to make.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:25:56):**  Yeah, they were like saying, need, leave it right.  And I was like, this is not, no, this isn't, it's not bread.  It's literally like fried dough.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:07):**  Okay, I think, yeah, give it a go.  The oil is hot.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:11):**  I'm going to get a spoon.  Yeah.  Amazing.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:19):**  Okay, I'm just dropping like a spoonful of the  batter into, we've got like quite a lot of oil.  We're kind of deep frying them.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:28):**  That's making a really nice sound.  Let's wait a bit.  Okay, so Dora has made the fritters.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:26:56):**  They're looking really nice and crispy.  Green.  Yeah, really green from the kalaloo and probably the seaweed as well.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:04):**  They also smell really fishy.  Yeah.  Which is good.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:08):**  Yeah, so we're going to eat some of them with the charred kalaloo dish.  Maybe some hot sauce.  Definitely.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:15):**  I was just thinking that.  So good.  Like really crispy and on the outside, but like soft and  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah, they turned out well actually.  Really good.  Yeah, really good flavour.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:31):**  I love ground flour.  I feel like it just like gives a really nice like stickiness of things.  They go well together.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah, really good.  Glenda told us that she got into growing pretty much by accident in her late 30s.  She chucked out some vegetable scraps in her garden, including some tomatoes,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:50):**  and she dug them into the soil.  After a while, of course, they started sprouting.  And so Glenda picked them out and transplanted them.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:27:58):**  And that's how it all started.  She's also massively into growing vegetables.  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:04):**  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  She's also a big fan of vegetables.  And that's how it all started. She's also massively into composting.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:12):**  She calls it a beautiful science.  Glenda is now involved with ITAL garden.  That's how Dora heard about her.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:18):**  It's an Afro diaspora led community garden in Lewisham, southeast London,  which was set up by a group called Cocoa Collective.  They grow culturally diverse foods and healing herbs.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:29):**  And they also run workshops in arts and crafts, mental and physical health and food growing.  It's an intergenerational space and it's open to everyone.  So AITAL is a group of African and Caribbean people who want to learn how to grow, I say  
**[0:28:45-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:28:45):**  our food, say tropical food. I was invited, would you like to assist us in a few workshops?  The first workshop was just potting up seeds and they were quite excited. They're very  young, they're only I think a year old and they're doing quite a lot for the community.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:04):**  I think they're there every Wednesday and Sunday, weeding, turning the compost, they're  germinating their seeds for the very first time. It's a good feeling on the one hand,  but then I feel quite sad that this should have been done many, many years ago. Growing  
**[0:29:21-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:21):**  your culture specific food is a warm feeling. The AITAL group is bringing younger people  to the allotment and sharing the information. Many of them would not be living in say,  houses, they're living in large estates and so forth and not have gardens per se. So it's  
**[0:29:41-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:41):**  our duty to show them how to start with growing food and having small gardens as they would  have back home. And many of them are bringing seeds to us. A lady from Zimbabwe would have  very unusual seeds, but you'd need like a greenhouse, warm heaters and so forth. Very  
**[0:29:59-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:29:59):**  large, extensive resources to bring forth what you really wanted to bring forth. There's  only a few things you can grow, but one of them is callaloo, which is doing quite well,  I think, in this country. It would be one of the plants that would be on every African  
**[0:30:17-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-3#t=0:30:17):**  Caribbean allotment. It is their first year, so I'm hoping that they'll see this year in  its plenty.

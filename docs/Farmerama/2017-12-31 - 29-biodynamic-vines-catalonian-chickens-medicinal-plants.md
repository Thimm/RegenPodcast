## 29: Biodynamic vines, Catalonian chickens & medicinal plants  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everybody, and welcome once again to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:09):**  We have some slightly longer stories for you this month from three young farmers scattered  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:13):**  across the globe.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:19):**  We visit one of the lesser known wine-making regions, Wales, to get one perspective on  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:24):**  biodynamic farming.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:25):**  Then we're off to the hills of Catalonia to hear from a small-scale chicken farmer.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:31):**  And finally we take a dose of medicine just outside Seattle in the form of herbs, human  
**[0:00:35-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:35):**  connections and the land itself.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:56):**  First up is young Welsh biodynamic farmer, Dave Morris.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:01):**  He grows and makes natural wine at Anchor Hill Estates in Monmouthshire, Wales.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:09):**  Biodynamic farming is often seen as pretty esoteric, but Dave makes it all seem fairly  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:15):**  straightforward and sensible.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:18):**  Here he tells us why he converted to biodynamics from conventional farming, explains some of  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:24):**  the philosophy and describes how he prepares his special biodynamic brews.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:29):**  So I'm Dave Morris, I'm the winemaker and vineyard manager at Anchor Hill Estates, which  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:37):**  is a biodynamically certified vineyard and winery in Monmouth, which is like southeast  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:42):**  Wales.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:43):**  So I was managing a lot of land, nearly 45 hectares of vines that was all quite young,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:50):**  that had been planted on sort of very intensively farmed arable land that hadn't really had  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:55):**  a rest and the amount of sort of chemicals and stuff that was being used on the grapes  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:02):**  just to sort of get them productive and keep them productive seemed to be increasing every  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:08):**  year and like the actual sort of quality of the soil was noticeably deteriorating.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:14):**  So all the things sort of combined, I kind of didn't make any logical sense.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:18):**  There didn't seem any sort of sustainability to carrying on that way.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:25):**  So that's when I started reading about specially biodynamic production.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:30):**  You know, there was one particular farmer, a producer called Gerard Goby whose methods  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:35):**  were very, seemed really practical and logical and really down to earth.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:41):**  He was just a good farmer and that really sort of struck a chord with me and I sort  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:46):**  of kind of maybe against sort of advice at the time, chucked in my quite good job and  
**[0:02:54-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:54):**  comfortable life and moved to France and worked for somebody who was affiliated with him and  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:03):**  also worked for a similar sort of ideologically minded producer in Champagne and Burgundy  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:09):**  and everything I learnt then sort of brought back here.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:14):**  So it's very similar lines to sort of soil association or organic accreditation.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:19):**  In fact, we actually do achieve a organic certification as well.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:25):**  But then to get the Demeter certification, you have to be using the biodynamic preps.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:30):**  So preparation 500, which is horn manure and preparation 501, which is horn silica have  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:38):**  to be used at least once a year.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:41):**  And the idea of those two is one is working on the soil, the 500, and one is working on  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:50):**  light really on the atmosphere and that's 501.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:55):**  And so the two kind of used in conjunction to balance each other.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:02):**  The two preps, the reason I prefer it to sort of organics is that biodynamics seems a lot  
**[0:04:08-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:08):**  more like proactive in that you're trying to affect those two forces.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:17):**  It's not just about what you don't use.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:20):**  And from a logical point of view, 500 to me is like such an intense population of active  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:26):**  bacteria and fungi that you're kind of like if you're making bread or beer or something,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:32):**  you're creating the conditions in the soil rather than like the dough.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:37):**  And then you're adding loads of bacteria and fungi to that to proliferate.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:44):**  It's like seeding the ground.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:47):**  With the 501, it's more a case of you're basically spraying a very, very dilute set of crystals  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:56):**  all over the vineyard.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:57):**  I'll start stirring for 501 at like half past four in the morning.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:02):**  I'll have it sprayed on the whole vineyard by eight o'clock in the morning.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:05):**  And then you have like, if it's a beautiful sunny day, you've basically kind of almost  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:09):**  sprayed like hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors all over your canopy.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:13):**  And the sunlight is reflecting all of those.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:16):**  You're maximizing your sunlight.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:18):**  I like the philosophical aspect of biodynamics, but there's a kind of a practical rationale  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:23):**  as well that I find really interesting.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:27):**  Again, under organic and biodynamic certification, you're allowed to use sulfur and copper.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:34):**  The two, as most people know.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:38):**  Sulfur is really readily just evaporating and used up in the environment.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:44):**  So I wouldn't say it's not harmful, but there's more of a buffer.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:48):**  There's more sort of capacity for the environment to use it.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:54):**  Copper's much more kind of, it hangs around in the soil for a long, long time and can  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:00):**  cause quite a few problems.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:01):**  And if it's used in the right, you know, small amounts and stuff, it can be necessary.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:07):**  I understand that.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:08):**  I'd rather not use it if I could.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:10):**  And so we started looking at alternatives and then again, from reading mainly, started  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:16):**  discovering that willow and other Osia trees are very high in salicylic acid.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:22):**  It's actually very easy to extract salicylic acid and it could be used instead of copper.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:30):**  So initially we started using it in conjunction with a copper spray.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:35):**  And as the vines have become sort of healthier and more robust as they've got used to biodynamics  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:41):**  and some, you know, like ground cover competition, all that sort of stuff, we've eased off and  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:46):**  we've not had to use copper now for, this is the fifth year.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:50):**  Because of where we live and where we're growing as well, there's a huge number of other plants  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:54):**  that are really high in salicylic acid.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:56):**  So we use something called Clivers as well, which is goose grass that, you know, like  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:00):**  as a kid you can get stick to people's clothes.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:03):**  And it's really, again, again, it's really kind of logical and obvious.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:08):**  Like these plants can grow in humid, damp conditions where nothing else can because  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:14):**  they'll suffer from disease.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:16):**  And there's a reason that these plants don't.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:18):**  And so they're kind of, you know, they're telling you, they've got their hands up really  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:22):**  asking to be used.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:24):**  And luckily Wales is quite wet lots of the time.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:27):**  So there's lots of those plants.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:29):**  So they're all readily available.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:31):**  They're all picked really easily, really quickly from around the vineyard and on the fringes  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:35):**  of the vineyard and usable.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:38):**  So the spraying is quite a lot of preparation because some of the sprays don't, they won't  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:44):**  last very long.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:45):**  You've got to use them within sort of 24 hours.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah, when the conditions look right, you've got to sort of make a decision and go and  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:51):**  then, yeah, cross your fingers.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah, my kid, I've got two young kids and they like, since Harry Potter, they've just  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:58):**  been like, oh, daddy does that.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:01):**  It's the same as kind of any philosophy or, you know, there's a like a spiritual element  
**[0:08:09-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:09):**  to it that sometimes certain people can become very dogmatic about how something's done.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:19):**  For me, when I read like the agriculture course by Steiner, it's just full of ideas.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:24):**  And you know, he was a philosopher.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:26):**  He wasn't a farmer.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:27):**  He's just trying to sort of help and open people's minds.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:30):**  And so for me, it's just a mine of ideas and they were just that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:36):**  And you can start then and explore them yourself.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:39):**  And that's, for me, that's what biodynamics is about.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:42):**  It's about trying to be proactive and trying to think on a much greater sort of level and  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:48):**  a wider sort of scope about what you're doing and why you're doing it.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:53):**  And it's that sort of kind of that interrogation.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:56):**  The reason why all of their plants used in biodynamic preparations grow around here is  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:00):**  because they've always been used.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:01):**  And it's kind of almost that knowledge has been lost.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:05):**  And so it's just his, to me, it's just his kind of reimagining of how and why they should  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:10):**  be used.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:13):**  It's having a kind of a philosophy to adhere to and to work to and having a sort of a greater  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:18):**  purpose to it is kind of, it's really helpful.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:22):**  You know, we were talking earlier about how hard farming can be sometimes.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:26):**  If you've got that kind of center point that like a moral sort of principle and why you're  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:31):**  doing it, it gives you a target and gives you something to be, to go back to.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:38):**  Dave Morris from Anchor Hill Estates.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:08):**  As we heard in a recent episode, new farmer Joel Rodker is in the process of setting up  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:31):**  a market garden near Peterborough.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:34):**  We're going to be back with him following his journey early in the new year.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:39):**  Earlier this year, Joel spent time with Jaume Pratel.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:42):**  Jaume is a chicken farmer who, like Joel, is moving towards making a living off the  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:46):**  land.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:47):**  Here, he talks to Joel about some of the creative ways he's making the most of a challenging  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:52):**  environment high in the mountains of Catalonia.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:01):**  We are surrounded by mountains, not very high.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:05):**  We are like 300 meters high from the sea.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:09):**  Above sea level.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:12):**  We are surrounded by pine and oak trees, forests.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:18):**  We are like 10 kilometers far from the sea, but since we are surrounded by mountains,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:24):**  we don't get that much of the influence as other towns around us.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:34):**  Well I'm Jaume Pratel.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:36):**  I'm 40 years old and I'm doing chicken egg farming in Orius, a little community about  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:47):**  one hour far from Barcelona.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:50):**  Life goes up and down, so I was working in a, I was a technician in a show company.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:58):**  Since I had two sons, my two sons, well I realized I had to change my life.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:05):**  And one of my dreams was to work the land.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:09):**  And here in this community in Orius, I found a place to work, find a piece of land, because  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:16):**  it's not easy.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:17):**  We arrived to Camp Famadas, which is the farm that we live and we work.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:24):**  And there was another man who was doing vegetables, just starting to, and we thought that doing  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:34):**  eggs could be a good complement for his activity, the one that he was doing.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:41):**  And well, we started learning about it because we only knew about our experience with three,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:48):**  four hands, that's it.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:51):**  And I was very lucky because my wife is very brave and she was like, yes, let's do it.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:59):**  That's our dream.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:00):**  It's now or never.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:04):**  We have, we think it's a small farm.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:10):**  It's thought to be worked by my wife and myself.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:15):**  We have 1,200 hens producing organic eggs.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:23):**  We have around 1,000 eggs a day.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:30):**  The first thing, our main occupation was to produce eggs.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:37):**  Once that we start producing, then we concern about what to do with manure, as an instance.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:48):**  Manure is going back to the land with our neighbor, who works on vegetables.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:57):**  But also, we are experimenting making worm castings.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:06):**  So we try to feed worms with our chicken manure.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:13):**  We are producing then worm castings that can be used in the field of our neighbors or other  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:23):**  farmers.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:24):**  We are still working to improve that.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:27):**  And our main goal could be to feed our chicken part of their meal with those worms that we  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:38):**  are producing.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:40):**  Let's see.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:41):**  That's very difficult because we need thousands and thousands of worms.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:44):**  But that could be our main goal in the next years.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:50):**  We are also working with the old hens.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:55):**  Hens that have finished their main productive period, so they get old, they don't produce  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:04):**  a good quality egg because the shell is very thin and they break.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:10):**  So with the old ones, we are making soup.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:16):**  It's a new product that we are trying.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:19):**  We mix it with organic vegetables and we make organic soup, which is a new thing in our  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:28):**  market around.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:32):**  We are changing our landscape, our piece of the world that we are running.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:39):**  And that means that we have to cut some trees to plant other trees.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:44):**  We are doing a transformation of the space following an idea that we have.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:51):**  We need trees because we need the shadow and we need the protection that the tree gives  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:55):**  to the hens.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:57):**  But if we have an oak or a pine, it gives us the shadow and the protection but not fruit.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:08):**  We thought that if we change it, we also can have fruit for the hens and for us.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:15):**  And we start having some proofs to see if, because we don't have that much water, so  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:24):**  we try to see how they react.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:28):**  And well, actually we have around 50 fruit trees of all kind of species, all the species  
**[0:16:39-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:39):**  that we are working with a farmer that recuperates these varieties of old fruit trees.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:52):**  So we have like a garden of different kind of fruit.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:01):**  My life has changed in a better way since I can, if I want, I can have breakfast, lunch  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:10):**  or dinner with my sons and my family.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:14):**  I work next to my house.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:18):**  I put my timetable.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:20):**  I choose my customers in some way and I wouldn't change that.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:26):**  I've never done it before and I like it a lot.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:32):**  I am also more related to land, which is satisfying, and also with my community.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:40):**  Now I'm not Jaume.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:42):**  They call me Jaume, the egg producer.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:49):**  So we have an identity related to land and I like that too.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:56):**  People don't do that much, but they like having people around them producing because they  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:01):**  know where products come from.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:08):**  That was Jaume Pertel talking to Joel Rodker for Farmerama.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:34):**  Ari Delania is the owner operator of community supported Camion Farm near Seattle.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:39):**  Camion, by the way, is Tagalog for with hands, a reference to the Filipino tradition of eating  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:45):**  with your hands and to the intimate connection between us and our food.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:50):**  As well as being a farmer, Ari is also an educator with a focus on the land and plants  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:54):**  as medicine.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:56):**  She spoke to Abby about both aspects of her work and the ways they inform each other.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:03):**  I just finished a workshop series around the theme of plant allies.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:08):**  We were exploring the idea of using plants as sort of a guide into our own personal well-being.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:17):**  The first workshop was on plant meditation and learning how to sit with plants and be  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:23):**  in deeper relationship with them.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:25):**  A lot of the people who come to my farm live in cities generally.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:30):**  They are around plants all the time but maybe not present enough to see that or to notice  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:35):**  that and so we wanted to give them some tools to be able to feel more resilient and feel  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:41):**  more connected to the place that they're in even if they're living in a city and they're  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:45):**  just walking a few blocks every day to catch the train.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:49):**  And part of that, I think when you're talking about communicating with plants, this might  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:53):**  sound kind of crazy to people, is like being able to trust your own intuition, right?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:57):**  And that like what you hear, what you perceive from plants is actually good and valid information  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:02):**  and I think that's a knowledge set that's been lost over time as we become more industrialized  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:08):**  and there's more focus on like hard science.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:10):**  So I think that it's a type of knowledge that's much older that I'm trying to bring back by  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:16):**  using plants.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:18):**  I came from a place that was like really lush.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:21):**  There were trees everywhere, there was plant life everywhere and I spent a lot of my childhood  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:25):**  sort of escaping into that and I went to college thinking I would do like environmental law  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:31):**  or something and be kind of an advocate for the environment and then when I started studying  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:37):**  environmental justice, I started thinking more deeply about all the ways that people  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:42):**  and the environment are so interconnected and that you can't actually approach like  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:48):**  advocating for the environment without talking about the people that are reliant upon it.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:54):**  And so I just went really deep into food work because everyone has to eat and there are  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:00):**  so many different issues that intersect with food and how we eat.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:04):**  So you can have conversations about it forever from so many different angles and that ended  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:11):**  me up in the policy world which was great and a really amazing learning experience and  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:17):**  I feel grateful now as a farmer to have that framework to think through when I'm doing  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:22):**  my work and when I'm talking to people.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:24):**  But I had been moving around doing all these different jobs for years and years and years  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:28):**  and I wanted to go home.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:30):**  I was really tired and my body was really tired and I went back home and I started farming  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:36):**  and I think it's been a really amazing experience to farm and do land work where you grew up  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:42):**  because I know the history of that place and I have a personal history there.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:47):**  So I think for me personally it's been really healing and that's been part of what I've  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:50):**  been trying to share with other people.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:53):**  In the UK we don't focus so much on our cultural context as much as it is here and especially  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:58):**  like different ethnicity, all that kind of stuff doesn't come up nearly as much.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:02):**  It would be great if you could say like what your cultural context is being here and how  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:07):**  that kind of manifests in the agricultural world.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:10):**  There's a number of different ways I could describe that but typically what I tell people  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:14):**  is that I mixed white and Filipina and I often say that I'm a bridge builder because I sort  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:20):**  of exist in two different worlds and in some ways sort of this anomaly and so I have a  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:26):**  lot of community that are folks of color and Filipino folks and then I also grew up inside  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:32):**  of a white family and so I kind of exist in a lot of different cultural contexts which  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:37):**  I think is part of why my work feels really relevant to me because I see a lot of people,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:44):**  especially where I'm farming, there's a lot of Filipino folks who have immigrated or just  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:49):**  a lot of immigrants in general who experienced trauma through the act of migration and maybe  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:56):**  it was they chose to move but a lot of times that wasn't the case.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:00):**  Their families had to leave their countries of origin and so I think that I've been moving  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:06):**  towards sort of catering to them because there's such a longing to have a sense of place and  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:13):**  belonging and to find people who are talking about land in a way that feels relevant to  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:19):**  them and the sort of like movement that they've experienced because I think when you get displaced  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:25):**  from your homeland there is so much loss there and if you don't find ways to sort of fill  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:33):**  that hole it can be deeply traumatic for the rest of your life.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:37):**  I don't think there's anything that can fix that but I think learning the plants of a  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:41):**  place and the environment and the ecosystems of a place that you're currently living in  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:47):**  can be a way to sort of heal and mend some of that.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:51):**  I've learned so many things about my body and the way that my body works just by working  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:56):**  on the land and one of the other farmers said earlier like I don't want to be the farmer  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:01):**  that at age 60 my body doesn't work anymore because of working this land and I'm constantly  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:06):**  thinking of the lessons that the land is trying to teach me and one of those things is like  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:12):**  the land doesn't overwork you know like the land knows how to work in community and all  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:17):**  the plants know how to work in community with each other so that they're not straining constantly  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:23):**  and one of the things that like teaches me that is sort of the temporality or the impermanence  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:29):**  of everything and so a lot of days I'll be running around really really busy and part  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:34):**  of my business is to harvest medicinal herbs and a lot of things that are medicinal are  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:38):**  also considered weeds so sometimes there'll be this big flush of weeds that I need to  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:43):**  harvest for my business and I won't notice because I'll just be so busy like running  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:49):**  and running and running and the land is so generous and constantly teaching you how to  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:55):**  be present and how to be in your body and aware enough to to sort of move through those  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:01):**  cycles with it.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:02):**  I'm constantly grateful that the land is so patient with humans and just is like okay  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:07):**  here's your lesson again here it comes again and you know I feel really lucky when there  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:12):**  are those moments when I actually stop to pay attention.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:15):**  A lot of people were talking about this idea of like the feminine and nurturing which I  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:20):**  think is really important but I also think that the feminine can also be about like destruction  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:25):**  and renewal and like anger and you know I think that there are all of these incredibly  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:31):**  dynamic ways that women can be and in my farming community there are tons of women who are  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:37):**  all so different and that's part of what makes it a really robust community and so I think  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:43):**  it's important to not be reductive or minimize what women can look like in this movement  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:49):**  because we need women that have such different characteristics to do all the different pieces  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:54):**  of it you know there's like restaurant work there are chefs there are farmers there are  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:01):**  herders and pastoralists we need all of those people and anybody any woman could do those  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:08):**  jobs you know so I think it's it's a matter of creating a platform for all of that diversity  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:14):**  to show because then I think more and more people will come to join us.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:20):**  What does that platform look like I guess is the question I mean that's a difficult  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:22):**  question.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:24):**  I think it depends on the scale that you're talking about but for example in my local  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:28):**  community I see women doing a ton of the work like they're running their own farms and then  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:34):**  they're also doing local policy work and they're also putting on these events they're doing  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:39):**  a ton of labor a lot of women just don't have enough time to also be at the front of a room  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:46):**  talking to people at the end of their 16 hour day and what I think is actually really necessary  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:51):**  now is that like men and other people that are sort of peripheral to this farming movement  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:56):**  are stepping up to help support and take on some of that labor so that they can be the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:01):**  voice and they can represent themselves.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:04):**  The more that we can mirror the diversity of what nature creates the better off we'll  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:08):**  be and the more resilient we'll be and I think there's no one path or one model for how we  
**[0:27:15-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:15):**  can do this and I think the more models that there are the better off we'll be.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:29):**  Thanks for joining us this month and in fact all this year we've had a brilliant time bringing  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:33):**  you stories from farmers and growers all over the world and we're looking forward to lots  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:38):**  more in the new year.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:41):**  Personally I'm still grounded quite literally by the reminder in episode 23 that we're all  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:45):**  going to end up as soil and I loved hearing about care farming projects in episode 21.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:51):**  Great examples of agriculture producing emotional mental and social yields as well as physical  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:57):**  ones.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:00):**  I loved hearing from the Welsh sheep farmer Rhys Roberts and Dame Fiona Reynolds in episode  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:05):**  22 with their thoughts on beauty and actually all the people who got in touch after saying  
**[0:28:10-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:10):**  farming is definitely about beauty to them.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:21):**  Looking forward I'm excited about the ongoing consultation on the Good Food Nation Bill  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:25):**  here in Scotland.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:26):**  It has the potential to be a pioneering cross-cutting piece of legislation but only if a truly wide  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:33):**  range of voices have the opportunity to contribute.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:36):**  If you're involved at all do get in touch.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:40):**  For the year ahead I'm excited to hear more stories from the fields.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:44):**  What's important to you?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:48):**  We make Farmerama to share knowledge amongst the independent farming community so if you've  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:52):**  got another story for us do let us know.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:56):**  We'd love to help you bring it to air and there are many different ways we can do that.

**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:06):**  like to tell us your story over the phone or even invite us down to your farm to visit  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:10):**  you in person.

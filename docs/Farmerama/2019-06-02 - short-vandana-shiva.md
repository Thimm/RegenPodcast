## Short: Vandana Shiva  
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:00):**  Vandana Shiva is a force of nature who has been described as a rockstar of the international  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:08):**  sustainable food movement. She has spent more than 40 years fighting for a more sustainable  
**[0:00:14-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:14):**  agricultural system in defence and celebration of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:22):**  In episode 46 we bought you a short extract from her talk at the Farming the Future event  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:26):**  organised by the Roddick and A-Team foundations. But we wanted to bring you more from this  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:31):**  talk that blew us away. She makes a powerful case for an agro-ecological approach to farming  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:37):**  and to environmental movements, from the health benefits of healthy soil and good food, to  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:42):**  the social impact of modern farming and how food growing can forge strong roots for derived  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:47):**  democracy. She certainly has convinced me that we all need to be putting our hands to  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:51):**  the soil as much as we can. Her background is in physics which she studied in Punjab.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:58):**  We join her talk as she describes the violence that continues in the region following the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:02):**  introduction of chemical farming.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:05):**  The land where I had done my MSc Honours in Physics, which was the most prosperous part  
**[0:01:12-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:12):**  of India Punjab, was erupting in violence. And the sacred shrine, the Golden Temple, the  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:21):**  army was sent and the desacralisation led to all kinds of issues. 30,000 people died  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:27):**  in that period. But it's not that it's over, because that's where the first experiment  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:32):**  on chemical farming in the third world was started, under the name of the Green Revolution.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:39):**  And in the mid-sixties. In Punjab today the suicide rate is very high. There's a canal  
**[0:01:47-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:47):**  where bodies are dug up every day. Every third young man in Punjab is today a drug addict.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:54):**  A problem we see everywhere in the world. Addiction in rural areas and farming families  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:01):**  and suicides. Indian suicides, 300,000. But it's not unique to India. Farmer suicides  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:08):**  are much higher than normal suicides in the US, in Australia, in France, in the UK, but  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:15):**  it's a silent issue that no one talks about. But that same year a pesticide plant leaked  
**[0:02:22-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:22):**  in the city of Bhopal. Kicked 7,000 people. The burials were mountains of dead bodies.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:30):**  And that shook me up. And I told the United Nations University, for whom I was doing some  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:36):**  work on conflicts over resources, I said something's going on on conflicts here and I want to understand.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:41):**  I said this conflict is a conflict between seeing the earth in non-violent ways and deploying  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:51):**  on the earth in the name of agriculture and increasing food production weapons of war.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:57):**  Every chemical that is used in agriculture today has come out of war. Down to the nitrogen  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:04):**  fertilizers which were made with the same techniques that made explosives. That's why  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:10):**  they make nitrogen bombs so easily. Every pesticide, a descendant of the gases that  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:16):**  were used in the concentration camps. The women of Bhopal say Bhopal was made a gas  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:23):**  chamber. Everywhere I travel in the world where the pesticide issue is killing people,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:32):**  saying we've been turned into gas chambers, we have been killed. 200,000 people. Every  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:37):**  year dying just of direct poisoning. Millions more with the impact.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:44):**  So I did this book called The Violence of the Green Revolution which I think Z has republished  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:48):**  in this country. But what I've learned since then are two simple principles which in a  
**[0:03:53-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:53):**  way are in our ancient learning in all cultures. First, that the currency of life is food.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:03):**  What moves through the web of life to nourish life? It's food and nutrition. And when we  
**[0:04:09-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:09):**  poison the food web, the highest dharma is the growing and giving of good food. And the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:18):**  highest adharma is getting lazy in agriculture and serving bad food or letting people go  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:26):**  hungry. That's all we have to do. Turn the growing of good food into our sacred duty  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:35):**  of being alive on this beautiful earth. And that's why we all have to become farmers.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:42):**  Maybe we're just a balcony. When Greece collapsed after 2008, we were there to launch the Seed  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:48):**  Movement and Seed Freedom Movement. And there was this young man. He said, but what can  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:53):**  I do? Our jobs have gone. Our pensions have gone. There's nothing. I said, you have a  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:00):**  balcony? Yeah. I said, grow food. He met me later, two years later. He said, I feed my  
**[0:05:05-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:05):**  entire street. So we've been made so deeply to think that money is the currency of life.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:17):**  And money is not the currency of life. It is no currency at all. It is just a medium  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:23):**  of exchange. If you look at your notes, it says, I promise to pay the bearer. It's a  
**[0:05:28-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:28):**  pure promise, nothing more. We've turned it into not just an end, we've turned it into  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:38):**  the measure of our humanity. We've turned it into the new God. The metric of the yield  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:46):**  was designed to reduce farming to the production of commodities. And all you measure in yield  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:53):**  per acre is the commodity that leaves the farm, not the state of the farm, not the quality  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:00):**  of the food. It's nutritionally empty, toxic commodities that are floating in huge quantity  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:06):**  around the world. 90% of the corn and soil going for biofuel and animal feed, not even  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:11):**  to feed people. And that's why the more commodities you have, the more hunger you have. Half of  
**[0:06:18-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:18):**  the hungry of the world, half of the one billion hungry are farmers. Half. So our food producers  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:28):**  have been turned into the hungry when they have this amazing role to play to care for  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:33):**  the earth. We decided for India to look at all the costs that go into the chemical agriculture  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:39):**  system, including the social costs of indebted farmers and farmer suicides, the environmental  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:47):**  costs, the soil, the death of animals, the death of bees, the disappearance of water.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:54):**  So we worked out just social and ecological $1.3 trillion annually, which is bigger than  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:00):**  our GDP, the destruction. And then if you add the health damages, which we haven't done  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:06):**  for India, but we have a new manifesto, Food for Health, and we've got a summary of it.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:11):**  So neurological neurodegenerative diseases, $2.4 trillion annual costs. Autism, $171 trillion.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:19):**  Birth defects, $22.9 trillion. Obesity, $1.2 trillion. Cancer, $2.5 trillion. Diabetes,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:25):**  $2.5 trillion. Endocrine disruption, $549 billion. Infertility, $9.6 million. And antibiotic  
**[0:07:35-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:35):**  resistance, $1 trillion. Good farming has to be defined as a health sector. It's health  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:44):**  provisioning. And not only is it health provisioning for human beings, it's health provisioning  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:52):**  for animals, for plants, and it's health provisioning for the planet. Because I see climate change  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:59):**  as nothing more than the metabolic disorder of the planet. All because of the huge emissions.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:06):**  And there's a focus only on emissions from energy and energy sector, but 50% emissions,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:14):**  greenhouse gas emissions, come from the industrial food system. The production, the fertilizers,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:21):**  the land use change, growing soybean in the Amazon, chopping down forests, transport,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:27):**  packaging, food miles, and food waste because the system designed to waste food. Add it  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:32):**  all up, it's 50%. And yet, if you work with the earth, we can repair the broken carbon  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:39):**  cycle, we can repair the broken nitrogen cycle, which is actually 300 times more deadly in  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:44):**  terms of emissions. Nitrous oxide is 300 times more damaging to the environment than carbon  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:51):**  dioxide is. We can repair these cycles and heal the soil and grow more food. And I think  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:59):**  this is the element that this community can bring to two movements that are very big and  
**[0:09:06-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:06):**  growing in this country. The first is Extinction Rebellion. They definitely need to see, yes,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:16):**  do the rebellion, but do the solution, grow the solution. And it's in our hands. The beauty  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:22):**  of it, in Paris, we planted a garden and we said, governments might fail, they could have  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:28):**  failed. The governments can fail, but we cannot fail the earth. So we made a pact with the  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:33):**  earth and planted a garden. And Extinction Rebellion is only looking at governments and  
**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:39):**  what they can do. But this movement begins with what we can do in our communities and  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:47):**  our particular places, not forgetting the duty of government and not forgetting to put  
**[0:09:51-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:51):**  pressure there, but as a derived activity of democracy, not at the heart of democracy.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:00):**  And I have learned in all of these years that the place to begin sowing the seeds of earth  
**[0:10:06-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:06):**  democracy is with food, is with a living seed. There's no other place. I can set up a windmill,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:18):**  but I'm just setting up a windmill. I'm not repairing a broken ecosystem. I can reduce  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:26):**  emissions by not having more, but I cannot pull down the stocks. Only the living earth  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:34):**  and our working with the living earth gives us the option of removing the past damage.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:42):**  Soil with organic matter and in our farms and in our members' farms, organic matter  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:48):**  has gone up by 99%, whereas in the chemical farms in our valley, it's gone down by 14%.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:55):**  This is a 20-year study the top soil ecologist of India did. In nitrogen, it's gone down  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:01):**  22% in chemical farms. It's gone up 100% in the organic farms, but zinc, which is a big  
**[0:11:09-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:09):**  deficiency and responsible for depression, 37% decrying in chemical farms, 14% increase  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:17):**  in organic farms. Nobody's putting zinc into the soil. The soil organisms are creating  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:23):**  these micronutrient centrized elements. That's why feeding the soil is our first duty. First  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:29):**  the soil, then the family that's growing the food, which is how we'll end hunger in agriculture.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:37):**  Then your local community, which is where the gift of food has to come back. And then  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:44):**  high value products, but low volume things so long distance. So trade right now has become  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:52):**  everything you eat has to come from far away. Lots of toxics. You don't know what you're  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:57):**  eating. And if you want to know what you're eating, there'll be one trade dispute to trash  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:02):**  you. And now with Brexit, the only US is just looking at England as the dumping ground of  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:08):**  all the worst food and the dismantling of the food and health and safety standards of  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:13):**  this country. It's going to be a very important time for the food and farming movement. Biodiversity  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:20):**  is the only way you can control pests without pesticides. The only way you can control weeds  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:25):**  without herbicides. And it's the only way pollinators get food because we forget the  
**[0:12:32-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:32):**  seed we sow, when it becomes a flower, is food for the bees. And the bee pollinates,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:43):**  fertilizes the flower, which becomes the fruit. Look at the economy. That's the economies  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:49):**  we have to build. Where the bee gets honey and the flower gets fertility and neither  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:54):**  became less. Because this Cartesian way of thinking mechanically is, if you have more,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:01):**  I have less. Which has also created the illusion of cheap. First, that there has to be cheap  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:08):**  food to feed the hungry. That food is not cheap. If you take all those costs to the  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:12):**  planet, to the farmers, to our health into account, it's too costly for us to continue  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:19):**  to produce. And that's why internalizing these externalities becomes a very important part  
**[0:13:23-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:23):**  of it. So it's not cheap. And I think while we address the ecological apartheid which  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:33):**  has separated us from the earth, we need to address the nutritional apartheid, as that  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:39):**  has brought a crazy situation. Where if food is the currency of our life, and the tiniest  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:45):**  of bees, and the tiniest of babies should be having good food, we have created an assumption  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:52):**  that the poor can be deprived. That being poor can pull you out of the cycle of life  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:58):**  where food is the nourishment. So, and the two apartheids go together, the two separations  
**[0:14:06-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:06):**  go together. The only way we'll be able to bring the right of all to good food is through  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:16):**  the right of all people to grow good food. I've reached the stage where I say the most  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:22):**  important thing the earth is asking us to do is put our hands, our heads, and our hearts  
**[0:14:28-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:28):**  to her service. And that's agriculture. So we need these hands. And the reason I think  
**[0:14:36-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:36):**  Colin, like me, questions so much the mechanical mindset, the old paradigm of thinking, which  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:46):**  grew with the fossil fuel age and with industrial agriculture being one element of it, is the  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:53):**  idea that human hands are useless. And if they're not useless, they must be made to  
**[0:14:58-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:58):**  look terribly dangerous. All food safety is hands touched it. Yeah? I mean, in India we  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:07):**  have big things of women's food systems. Women cook with hand. You know, we say handmade  
**[0:15:12-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:12):**  is our new subversive label. Bring the hands back. And that's why the only way to reduce  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:24):**  fossil carbon is to increase living carbon and increase the human capacity to work. We've  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:33):**  forgotten, you know, the definition of energy is the capacity to work. That the ultimate  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:40):**  energy we have is our capacity to work. And especially when you think of the fact that  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:47):**  with artificial intelligence people like Zuckerberg are talking about 99% human beings being useless.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:54):**  I think we need to do two things. First is unleash all the intelligences, all the intelligences  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:03):**  of the amazing planet, all her living systems. Won't you just share with you this one simple  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:09):**  thing? I mean, the neurological activity going on in our gut with food is much bigger than  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:16):**  the neurological activity going on in this brain up here. That's why it's called the  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:21):**  second brain now. The gut is being called the second brain. But in the root of the plant,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:29):**  in one plant, one plant, 13 million rootlets, all combined with the root hairs, 6,000 miles.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:40):**  One plant. Each little rootlet is functioning with exchange. It has a cerebral cortex with  
**[0:16:50-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:50):**  larger root systems, brain neurons, 14 billion. One plant has as much activity going on. And  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:02):**  we define them as vegetables and said they are dead. And I think the big revolution for  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:09):**  food and farming, I mean, J.C. Bose, our physicist, had done amazing work on plants as living  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:14):**  systems. I think the intelligence of plants, the intelligence of soil organisms, the intelligence  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:18):**  of the earth as a whole, the intelligence of animals, including this animal, which has  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:23):**  lost its animal intelligence in the seeking of permission of mechanical intelligence.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:30):**  And now we're being told, for real, you throw away people. So we need a whole new hope for  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:36):**  young people by getting rid of the Iraqis of work, that farming is the past, software  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:42):**  is the future, and the next future is disposability. No. Farming is the highest vocation. Cultivating  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:50):**  food is the highest thing you can do. And Gandhi had a very beautiful, when people said,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:55):**  how do you think small changes can make a difference? He said, I'm not saying we'll  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:59):**  stay small, but we'll spread out. Not scale up, but scale out. And the way he described  
**[0:18:06-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:06):**  it is ever expanding, never ascending, oceanic circles, of which each of us is a part. But  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:16):**  each of us is a center. Each seed is a center of the farming system. But nothing is oppressing  
**[0:18:21-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:21):**  it as a pyramid. Each of them is spreading life in collaboration, in amazing cooperation  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:30):**  with an inner intelligence. The last idea that's coming to me is, you know, all of living  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:36):**  systems are based on self-organization. It's being called autopoiesis, organizing from  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:43):**  within. Free societies are organized from within. Gandhi talked about self-rule. All  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:49):**  controlled systems are organized externally. Earlier it was chemicals as external inputs,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:55):**  but now it's knowledge will be external input, data will be external input. You'll have to  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:01):**  borrow more and more and more. You have to live in perpetual debt to stay alive. If you  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:08):**  look at the debt craving, someone gave the figure in one of our groups, two pounds for  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:13):**  the children, one pound goes for water, and one pound for food. How could we come to this  
**[0:19:20-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:20):**  situation in what was the heart of the big empire? So we talked about decolonizing England.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:29):**  And we have a wonderful, you know, we have a beautiful link and we should talk about  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:32):**  this. Albert Howard, who was sent to India in 1905, he was brought to industrialize India's  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:38):**  farming. He brought back organic farming to this country. We've got to do a little bit  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:41):**  more of that. Over all of these years, to learn from the earth, to learn from nature,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:48):**  to learn from our farmers and our peasants, to learn how to cultivate community both as  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:53):**  earth community, but as human communities because we've lost the capacity. Fossil fuels  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:57):**  just ruptured our relationship. We built an earth university. And I think one thing we  
**[0:20:03-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:03):**  could serve and be happy to serve is if you want young farmers trained for a quick transition.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:14):**  And you know, instead of thinking of how many farmers are going out, let us make a 10 year  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:20):**  plan. And in the 10 year plan is poison free food and farming, fossil fuel free systems.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:27):**  A 10 year plan of get the public money out of subsidizing the wrong thing into supporting  
**[0:20:31-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:31):**  the right thing because right action doesn't need subsidy, it needs support. And finally,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:40):**  educating young farmers, growing young farmers and our university is always there for that  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:45):**  service. Thank you.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:55):**  This episode was edited by me, Suzy McCarthy, for Farmer Armour. Thanks for listening.

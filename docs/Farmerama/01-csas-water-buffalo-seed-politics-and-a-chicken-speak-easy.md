### Farmerama  (2017-03-10)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the first ever episode of Farmerama. I'm Nigel and here with...  I'm Joe and I'm Abby. We're here to bring you stories from farmers and growers around the UK.  We want to get into the nitty-gritty of producing things like soil experiments,  
**[0:00:23-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:23):**  choosing different seed varieties, sustainable or maybe resilient food systems.  Just generally sharing cool honest projects and ideas going on in food and farming around  the UK and beyond. And we'd like you all to be involved. We hope to speak to a lot of you in  
**[0:00:41-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:41):**  the coming months and provide a place where people involved in farming on whatever scale  can share stories, hear about latest developments and bring this community closer together. So maybe  a little help to introduce us was who are we talking about farming. My experience of farming  
**[0:00:58-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:58):**  was delivered at this first Farmerama meeting where we've just eaten some rocket that I've  grown. So I'm very new to this. Welcome to the fold. Welcome to the fold. Abby, what's your  experience? Well, my family are farmers, but in Chile, South America. And I've been working with  
**[0:01:17-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:17):**  the community farmers there to build tools for them, with them. And generally from a tech  perspective, seeing how tech and tools can empower smaller scale farmers to really prosper.  And Nigel, you're a serious farmer. I didn't know about that, Joe. I grew up on a small family farm  
**[0:01:36-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:36):**  in East Sussex. So I guess I kind of grew up knowing, didn't really know about, you know,  anything other than farming, I suppose, sort of being raised on goat's milk and talked to, you  know, herd cows and sheep at a very early age. So yeah, I have some experience, but it's only more  
**[0:01:55-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  recently the last like couple of years after about 10 years or so in London that I've actually sort  of returned to my roots as it were. Yeah. And I'm sort of now farming with my parents and hoping to  sort of inject some energy and new ideas into UK agriculture. Last year, Nigel embarked on an epic  
**[0:02:14-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:14):**  road trip across the country. And we're going to hear several reports from this trip over the next  few episodes. Nigel, perhaps you can tell us about why you wanted to do this trip.  I was living in London and basically interviewing mainly sort of urban growers and farmers. And I  
**[0:02:31-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:31):**  was really keen to kind of maybe get a bit more of a sense of what's happening outside of London.  So I embarked on this sort of six week road trip on my scooter, Veronica, that was her name,  or is her name, she's still around. And it was very much, I sort of basically put it out there  
**[0:02:48-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  and on some social media, sort of Twitter, Facebook, and I didn't really know exactly who  I was going to see. So it was very free, you know, sort of organic in terms of the roots.  But I, I, hold up, hold up, hold up. Very organic in terms of the roots. I think we need to be a  
**[0:03:07-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:07):**  bit careful with our. Let's see how we go. The first place we're going to travel with you on  Veronica is a Buffalo farm. That's that's it. Yeah. Broughton Water Buffalo Farm, which was a farm I  visited whilst traveling through Hampshire. And I met a really interesting farmer there and he  
**[0:03:30-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:30):**  showed me around his, his kind of quite extensive grazing system. And just the fact that he had  water buffalo, isn't something you see on an everyday farm. I don't know if it's scary. I mean,  I think, you know, they certainly, they certainly a bit more menacing than your average native  
**[0:03:45-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  Sussex or Hereford. So, so yeah, certainly. I mean, I was a slightly, yeah. I mean, not alarmed,  but I'm wary of them. And, but I mean, at the same time, very much the very captivating cause  they're, they're sort of quite beautiful. You know, they're very, you know, they have  
**[0:04:06-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:06):**  a certain charm. They are quite majestic actually. Yeah. They also make a really unusual  sound. I've never heard, I mean, like, don't make this sound. They're almost like a, a croaking sound  or something like that. Like a fog. Yeah. Like almost like a, almost like a frog, which I found  
**[0:04:24-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:24):**  really like interesting and talking to the farmer, he was, he was just so in tune with the whole sort  of ecosystem. He kind of strip grazing where the, he lets an awful lot of his cattle into quite a  small space and they trample down the grass and then, you know, well, they eat some of it and they  
**[0:04:43-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:43):**  trample a little bit down, which returns a lot of organic matter back into the soil. His grandfather  farmed in, in a more sort of traditional or, you know, conventional way,  whereas he's an entirely organic farmer in that sense. Fantastic. Well, let's,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:59):**  let's meet these majestic beasts. We took it over and reverted it back to a natural grassland  farming system. Yeah. And we got in the water buffalo, Indian water buffalo, that they've got in  Italy for mozzarella cheese. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a few producers in this country,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  mostly concentrating on milk production, going into the Asian community and that. Okay. And we've  got, we basically run for meat. Okay. And we sell all the meat that they produce locally at farmers  markets and through pubs and restaurants and catering events we do as well. Okay. What we do  
**[0:05:50-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  is we, we put all the herd into one group. So it's about, well, most of it anyway, about 200  animals in one group. And we put them onto fresh paddocks each day. This is something they call it  mob grazing. Right. And it's a way of, you get all the animals into a small area and they go in and  
**[0:06:13-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:13):**  they graze it off nice and evenly. They dung all over it. And then they move back, they move on  and they go onto the next bit of ground. And so it then gets a real long rest of two, three months.  Okay. And what we're finding is this is kind of, it's feeding the soil and it's kicking the soil  
**[0:06:38-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:38):**  into life and it's gradually, very, very slowly, but we're getting a kind of upturn in productivity  as we start to see the, you know, the effects on it. Yeah. Do you bring them inside or they stay  outdoors or winter as well? No, no, they come in. Oh, they do come in. Okay. Got you. We like to build  
**[0:07:00-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:00):**  the shed every so often just to show the local farming community how successful our operation  is. You know, they're glad to come in, but glad to go back out again. Yeah. So it works okay.  A week or two ago, we went along to the canal side community gardens in Leamington Spa for the CSA  
**[0:07:23-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  network gathering. And one or two conversations got us thinking. Before we get there, CSA means  community supported agriculture. Nigel, what exactly is this? In most traditional farming  systems, agriculture, the risk lies more or less solely with the farmer. What community supported  
**[0:07:43-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:43):**  agriculture is all about is basically sharing that risk. So essentially they work in harmony,  the farmer and the consumer of that product work together. So essentially the consumer pays a  monthly price or an annual price for the harvest and will basically reap the rewards of that  
**[0:08:03-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:03):**  harvest. Or indeed also if the crop fails or doesn't do as well, they also don't then get as  much food as well. And I suppose this has the also added effect of sort of bringing people a lot closer  to the process of their food. Like you're aware of what's going on, you're personally involved.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  You know, generally when CSAs are set up and they find local members, the whole point is about sort  of educating the members about that food growing process. And there was a great community feel at  this event wasn't there? There were babies and old people and farmers of all ages. Yeah, yeah,  
**[0:08:47-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:47):**  definitely. And well, we went for the party, which was really fun. The Kaylee, yeah. The world dancing  and it was a really great atmosphere. And what actually from the day what kind of excited me most  was the idea of, well, for one, people coming and having the opportunity to help out with the farming  
**[0:09:07-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  a few days a year. You know, that's part of often a lot of CSAs, that's part of the commitment.  And then also the idea that you could get more involved with what foods you actually want to be  planted and the taste of the foods. So like, say you really like the taste of stripy beetroot or  
**[0:09:25-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  something, you have the opportunity to be like, well, let's try planting this at this time. And  you know, getting that kind of really from the moment you're tasting something right back to the  moment it's planted and really connecting that up. I like that kind of two way discussion going on  
**[0:09:44-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  between the people eating and the people growing. But we met some really committed people.  There's a real movement happening, I think. You know, it seems a lot of young voices, well,  as Abby mentioned, like a mixture of ages and everyone seemed very upbeat about the future,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  which is great. It was great. And I think we're going to hear from a few of those people now.  Let me start with one of the less young voices, but I'm young in spirit. Robert Simpson, who is a  founding member of the CSA network in the UK. You know, you've got to think about something  
**[0:10:23-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  which is very banal, like growing food in this new kind of way that it's actually central. And  like you're saying, this is the connection between the kitchen and the cooking and the growing.  So everything is understood in terms of relationships all the time. And that is not  
**[0:10:40-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  the mindset of many or most farmers, you know, they've got it all boxed up.  What came up a lot on the day was like, what's the difference between a box scheme and a CSA?  And I think that is something that for a lot of people maybe isn't clear on, you know, first sight.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:57):**  But we really got when we were there at the gathering was that actually this is really  something more than just getting vegetable boxes delivered. You're really part of a community and  you're really learning. And there's engagement in both directions. And that's really exciting.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  Now, one thing, one of the stranger things we heard about on the day was also a way of getting  the community involved. And it was a chicken speakeasy. So sort of just mull that over in  your mind a minute and think what that might be. And then Nigel's going to tell us.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  So I think the chicken speakeasy was essentially an unofficial sort of abattoir.  I can't sell you a processed chicken. Very illegal, very naughty. But I can sell you a live chicken.  So he goes, here's your chicken. Oh, what the hell do I do with this?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  One hand on the head and one hand on the body.  And then we'll have like the plucking session.  The whole point here is that they're not actually slaughtering these animals illegally.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:57):**  They're organising parties where people can come round and they can legally slaughter their own animals.  There's also a really clear, as far as I could tell, sense of wanting to become part of a system  that in some ways seemed to be almost that the system was too big and the CSA network was so small  
**[0:12:19-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:19):**  that even they had lots of good ideas which really did fit in with lots of the aims of national policy.  They're kind of a little bit too small to make that noise loud enough.  The system couldn't think in units as small as one grower on a field.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, it was really interesting actually hearing about how efficient the CSA systems were.  Comparing those to the food systems we have in place and especially with recent announcements  about the importance of reducing food waste in the UK.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  It was really interesting to hear that actually a CSA system has the lowest food waste.  Roughly 25% of what supermarkets sell is wasted.  That's a really significant figure because that's also 25% of their profits.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:11):**  So waste is absolutely fundamental to the supermarket system because if they didn't have  if we and that's just our waste not that not the waste before that's just what we wasted home.  And that's where we buy 25% if we're buying from supermarkets more than we need.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  Which is perfect for a supermarket because that's actually 25% and that's a massive amount of sale.  And of course the whole remit of the supermarket is sell it cheap, sell lots of it and sell it cheap.  They work on quite pretty small margins, you know, percentage very small margins.  
**[0:13:44-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  It's just it's just about bulk. So the system is pretty crap and highly, highly inefficient.  Whereas here, what have we got? So the study I did here was was was one bit was very easy  to measure what waste was was left in the field.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  Well, it wasn't any.  If you've been in there, there is a there's a bean in the corner.  And that is the only thing. So occasionally we have a real glut.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:16):**  And sometimes beetroots are a bit hard to move. Even I find it difficult to eat all the beets we get sometimes.  There's just a tiny tiny tiny about point zero two percent of what's produced is wasted here.  It's just meaningless.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:32):**  That was Nigel talking to us about efficiency and food waste.  Any closing thoughts on that?  I think it's just about efficiency and food waste.  
**[0:14:41-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:41):**  Any closing comments on CSAs? Because I feel it's some it's a movement, an idea which we're going to be returning to.  Yeah, I think it has huge potential, just really needs more farmers to actually learn about, you know,  the potential of setting them up and working with the local community.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  So I think it's one of those systems is a really good idea.  It just really needs more people to to adopt the CSA system.  And I think it has huge potential to really help feed and teach communities about where their food comes from.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:21):**  Our friend Zahra Rahman has done a historical and political examination of seeds in her podcast, Collusion.  She kindly let us use a short segment for Farmer Rahman.  We wanted to bring this in because many people were really excited,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  especially in the sustainable agriculture kind of section,  that the European Union dropped recent proposed regulations on seed varieties.  And Zahra shows that the power of seeds is nothing new.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:53):**  Biopiracy is a way to describe the appropriation or use of indigenous forms of knowledge by commercial actors.  In practice, this could be, for example, scientists or researchers coming to an area  like indigenous communities in Mexico to learn about their medicines and compounds,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:08):**  then taking samples of this back to their research institutions and eventually getting a patent on them.  A form of biopiracy is bioprospecting, when researchers find compounds, plants or medicines used by indigenous people  and patent it without recognizing that the knowledge is neither new nor invented by the patenter.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  Somewhat incredibly, this patent might later be used against the community from whom the knowledge was first found,  and usually the rights to the commercial profits from this kind of technology are denied to the indigenous community.  One of the first most well-known cases of biopiracy was the Maya International Cooperative Biodiversity Group.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  It began as an alliance between the University of Georgia in the US, a small Welsh pharmaceutical group  and an NGO intended to represent the indigenous Maya of Chiapas, as well as various US federal agencies.  The aim of the project was to promote drug discovery from natural sources,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:17):**  biodiversity conservation and sustainable economic growth in developing countries.  But even though the project had a code of ethics and the two main researchers had years of experience  in working with communities in the region, lots of concerns were raised by people within the community.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  The major issue here was the idea of gaining prior informed consent from those communities.  According to Sebastien Luna, an indigenous spokesperson from the council,  the project is a robbery of traditional indigenous knowledge and resources with the sole purpose  
**[0:17:48-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  of producing pharmaceuticals that will not benefit the communities that have managed and nurtured  these resources for thousands of years. Luna explains in a written statement how the project  aimed explicitly at privatising and commercialising knowledge that up until that point had always been  
**[0:18:04-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:04):**  collectively owned, and this move contradicted strongly with the culture and traditions of the  communities involved. It was also difficult given that some individual members of the community  took the decision to actually collaborate with the researchers in return for a relatively small  
**[0:18:20-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:20):**  amount of money, but one that made a big difference to their personal economic situations which were  very difficult at the time.  India started the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library Project, an Indian digital knowledge  
**[0:18:43-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:43):**  repository of the traditional knowledge, especially about medicinal plants and formulations, used in  Indian systems of medicine. It was set up in 2001 and seeks to classify and keep a public record of  medicines that have been used for years in India. It protects the traditional knowledge of the country  
**[0:19:01-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:01):**  from exploitation by biopiracy and unethical patents, and it also makes access to the database  much easier than before. It essentially started as a response to biopiracy and patent claims,  for example in the past patents have been granted on turmeric and even basmati rice, and one of the  
**[0:19:18-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:18):**  main obstacles around this issue was that the patent examiners couldn't search through traditional  knowledge to see if it had already existed prior to the patent being brought about. In part this  was because of a language barrier. Traditional Indian knowledge might exist in any local language  
**[0:19:34-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  such as Sanskrit, Urdu, Tamil, whereas the patent examiners likely in these cases coming from the US  were unlikely to be able to understand these languages. Within the traditional knowledge  digital library that information is now available in English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese,  
**[0:19:51-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:51):**  meaning that hopefully it's more likely to be used and referred to by patent examiners. It gives  modern names to medicines and aims to bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern  knowledges. On their website they've been keeping a record of patents coming largely from the US,  
**[0:20:06-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:06):**  Canada and Europe that have been withdrawn thanks to reference to the traditional knowledge digital  library and up till now they've classified about 200,000 different formulations. Another response  that can be seen among community activists is the establishment of community seed banks aimed at  
**[0:20:23-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  protecting indigenous seeds, helping farmers return to organic farming and reducing dependency upon  multinational corporations. So you heard from Zara her thoughts but what can we do here in the UK?  Well it turns out people are thinking about just this. I spoke to Ben Raskin of the Soil Association  
**[0:20:53-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  about a new project he's been working on. We did an open pollinated seed variety trial where we  got a whole load of varieties that weren't available organically, tested them in organic  systems and then there were a couple that did really well so we went on to second year and  
**[0:21:11-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  tried those two varieties in more places, more holdings. But it then got me thinking about the  fact that a lot of what this is about is just information sharing and there's no  independent testing of organic varieties now in the UK, there used to be. They cut the funding  
**[0:21:31-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:31):**  about eight years ago. So how do, and it's come up a few times today in discussions, how do you  know what variety of what to grow, you know, and what suits here might not suit down the road,  you know, all that sort of stuff. So what I've started an online seed survey. So people basically  
**[0:21:50-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  put in very basic, because the idea is keeping it easy so that people do it, basic information about  how varieties perform. So you can literally put in one variety and it would take about a minute  or you can send me a spreadsheet of your whole cropping thing and I'll input it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  And then in theory this will become an online searchable map by location, by soil type,  so heavy, medium or light. And then sort of whether it's been growing inside or outside.  So there's a few bits of information that you need to put in that you can then say, right,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  I want to find out carrot varieties that do really well on heavy soil in Lancashire. You zoom in  and people will put them and there'll be a public and a commercial version, both in the same format.  So you can merge the data, but also separatable. So that if you're a commercial growing, you really  
**[0:22:40-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:40):**  just want commercial varieties, then you can do it like that. It's early days, but he's keen to  expand this project. So if you want to get involved, then post on our Facebook page or Twitter  and we can add you to the list of trialists. The more we speak to farmers, the more we hear about  
**[0:22:55-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:55):**  the new ways they are using technology to make their farm work. We think this is particularly  exciting for smaller scale farmers. And we've already talked to a few of them who've told us  about the technologies that are keeping them producing. You'll hear from them all in the coming  
**[0:23:10-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  episodes. But for now, our new friend Robert Simpson from the CSA network is also keen on  sharing the experimentation in the growing world. I'm convinced that this is the what's happening.  The big environment is so ignorant and so unsympathetic. The chances of these experiments,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  you know, having a long life in that environment is kind of, you know, you're against the grain.  But the value is that we've trialed all sorts of experiences and experiments. They talk about  ecology and redundancy. So redundancy, that's OK. So what we have to do is to make sure we've got  
**[0:23:50-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:50):**  opportunity to do these experiments. And so, yes, some will be successful and some will not be  successful. You know, that's the beauty of it. But what is key to that is this thing, you know,  we've got all the technology. For God's sake, let's record what's going on. Because the moment  
**[0:24:08-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  will come when that unsympathetic and ignorant environment in which all this experimentation is  happening will implode on itself or explode on itself. There'll be some ghastly non-linear,  i.e. systemic, if there is a system out there, catastrophe of some kind.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  Quite serious there. And luckily, Farmerama are here to do some of that recording. So hopefully  we can save future generations or current generations ourselves from...  Implosion.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:47):**  Explosion.  Who knows?  That's interesting. And another thing which was really clear from talking to Robert was  
**[0:24:56-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:56):**  sometimes when we talk about technology, people are assuming new technology.  But Robert really talked to us about rediscovering old and forgotten bits of technology from the past  and seeing how we might be able to make use of that again. Or even simply just making sure we  
**[0:25:15-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  don't forget. Yeah, I think it's really important to remember that everyone kind of thinks technology  means digital in this day and age, but that's just a very recent understanding of the word technology.  And that we really need to have a much broader understanding of what technology means. It's  
**[0:25:33-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:33):**  almost like closer to tools than it is to digital, well, in my view. Seeing history as a resource to  re-envisage the future. The now is just between what was and what's to come. And well, what do  you want to come? So you learn about the past in order to resource your envisioning of the future.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  And what do you think is the role of technology to play in the future? Because obviously that  wasn't necessarily in the past. New technologies. Well, you're asking me something which is  preoccupying me a lot at the moment because technological innovation is subject to a law  
**[0:26:21-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:21):**  of diminishing returns. It's always the argument that we can grow by substitution. New technology  will find us a new substitute for petroleum, for instance. Problem solving and using technological  fixes as part of the problem solving process is subject to this law. It's not ultimately going  
**[0:26:48-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:48):**  to be a fix, whether there is a fix as such. So it's quite, because I've been reading quite a  bit about collapse theory and that's, I think now I'm not comfortable about talking about  sustainability because I think probably much better to use the word resilience really.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:10):**  Because resilience is part of the ecological cycle. There was this famous psychologist called  Buzz Hollings who did this work on American pine forests. I can't remember where it is,  on the East Coast somewhere. And did all the mathematical modelling and discovered that the  
**[0:27:29-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  climax, forest climax stage of development is very, very brittle and unstable and it collapses.  So there's climax and collapse and then regeneration and the whole cycle starts again.  So there was also a social scientist, a paleoanthropologist who did work in the 90s on  
**[0:27:51-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:51):**  social collapse and he worked out this idea that the pursuit of sustainability is a driver of  collapse of complex societies, which is a pretty scary thought to get your head around because,  you know, we've listened to the talk about sustainability for so long, but it isn't an  
**[0:28:12-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:12):**  ecological category. You know, there's always this moving through and so resilience is a much more,  a much more serviceable idea. So that's why I say, you know, we're going to see some of these  projects fail. This is almost inevitable, but the value will be that we've got actually some  
**[0:28:34-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:34):**  technology which we can record what happened and how it worked, you know, and that will be immensely  important when the collapse stage of our complex society starts to impact. So that may not be my  lifetime, but it's certainly been yours, I should think. Robert has an awful lot to say about an  
**[0:28:56-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:56):**  awful lot. We think he's great. So we're going to be hearing more from him over the next few  episodes. Robert and Ben have both in slightly different ways talked about how sharing knowledge  and experience is important. And this is an idea we're really keen on at Parmarama. As we mentioned  
**[0:29:14-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:14):**  at the start of the show, we'd like to hear as many voices as possible and give a feel for what's  going on across the whole country. That means we want to hear your voice. So we have a little  request or an opportunity. We'd like to invite people to send in short stories, letting us know  
**[0:29:31-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:31):**  what you've been up to. It could be an explanation on how a new variety of plum is doing or a response  to something you heard on the show or elsewhere, or maybe simply just telling us how much you enjoy  being outdoors. Basically a little news story from the farm out in the field. We want to hear your  
**[0:29:50-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:50):**  experiences. We want to hear from all corners of the country. Just give us a feel for what's going  on with you as part of this work you do. It sounds somewhat daunting, but technology-wise,  it really is easy enough to make a recording on your iPhone. If you've got something, then let us  
**[0:30:07-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:07):**  know and we'll tell you where to send the files. We're also really happy to help with the  technical questions. So we can't wait to hear what you've been up to.  Thank you so much for joining us on what has been the first episode of Farm to Rama.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:34):**  And so subscribe to the feed on iTunes to make sure you get all the episodes, all the future  episodes. Okay. So just quick, you can find us on Facebook at farmarama radio. And then on Twitter  and Instagram, our handle is at farmarama underscore underscore. So that's two underscores,  
**[0:30:56-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:56):**  a really long line. So do once again, at farmarama underscore underscore. We'd love to  hear from you. Farmarama has been made by the three of us. Me, Abby Schlosser,  me, Nigel Akerst, and I'm Joe Barrett. We'd like to thank Zara Laman for her feature on Seeds,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:14):**  and our guests this episode, Ben Raskin and Robert Simpson. We'll leave you today with the  Sounds of Ben, this time singing us out with a traditional Irish folk song from the CSA event  the other week.

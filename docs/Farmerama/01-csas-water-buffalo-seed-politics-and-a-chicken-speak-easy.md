### Farmerama  (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 12:10:13)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the first ever episode of Farmerama. I'm Nigel and here with...  
**[0:00:11-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:11):**  I'm Joe and I'm Abby. We're here to bring you stories from farmers and growers around the UK.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  We want to get into the nitty-gritty of producing things like soil experiments,  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:23):**  choosing different seed varieties, sustainable or maybe resilient food systems.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:29):**  Just generally sharing cool honest projects and ideas going on in food and farming around  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:35):**  the UK and beyond. And we'd like you all to be involved. We hope to speak to a lot of you in  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:41):**  the coming months and provide a place where people involved in farming on whatever scale  
**[0:00:44-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:44):**  can share stories, hear about latest developments and bring this community closer together. So maybe  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:53):**  a little help to introduce us was who are we talking about farming. My experience of farming  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:00:58):**  was delivered at this first Farmerama meeting where we've just eaten some rocket that I've  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:04):**  grown. So I'm very new to this. Welcome to the fold. Welcome to the fold. Abby, what's your  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:09):**  experience? Well, my family are farmers, but in Chile, South America. And I've been working with  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:17):**  the community farmers there to build tools for them, with them. And generally from a tech  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:24):**  perspective, seeing how tech and tools can empower smaller scale farmers to really prosper.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:29):**  And Nigel, you're a serious farmer. I didn't know about that, Joe. I grew up on a small family farm  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:36):**  in East Sussex. So I guess I kind of grew up knowing, didn't really know about, you know,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:41):**  anything other than farming, I suppose, sort of being raised on goat's milk and talked to, you  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:49):**  know, herd cows and sheep at a very early age. So yeah, I have some experience, but it's only more  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  recently the last like couple of years after about 10 years or so in London that I've actually sort  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:00):**  of returned to my roots as it were. Yeah. And I'm sort of now farming with my parents and hoping to  
**[0:02:06-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:06):**  sort of inject some energy and new ideas into UK agriculture. Last year, Nigel embarked on an epic  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:14):**  road trip across the country. And we're going to hear several reports from this trip over the next  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:19):**  few episodes. Nigel, perhaps you can tell us about why you wanted to do this trip.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:25):**  I was living in London and basically interviewing mainly sort of urban growers and farmers. And I  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:31):**  was really keen to kind of maybe get a bit more of a sense of what's happening outside of London.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:37):**  So I embarked on this sort of six week road trip on my scooter, Veronica, that was her name,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:43):**  or is her name, she's still around. And it was very much, I sort of basically put it out there  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  and on some social media, sort of Twitter, Facebook, and I didn't really know exactly who  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:02:54):**  I was going to see. So it was very free, you know, sort of organic in terms of the roots.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:00):**  But I, I, hold up, hold up, hold up. Very organic in terms of the roots. I think we need to be a  
**[0:03:07-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:07):**  bit careful with our. Let's see how we go. The first place we're going to travel with you on  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:17):**  Veronica is a Buffalo farm. That's that's it. Yeah. Broughton Water Buffalo Farm, which was a farm I  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:24):**  visited whilst traveling through Hampshire. And I met a really interesting farmer there and he  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:30):**  showed me around his, his kind of quite extensive grazing system. And just the fact that he had  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:36):**  water buffalo, isn't something you see on an everyday farm. I don't know if it's scary. I mean,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  I think, you know, they certainly, they certainly a bit more menacing than your average native  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  Sussex or Hereford. So, so yeah, certainly. I mean, I was a slightly, yeah. I mean, not alarmed,  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:03:53):**  but I'm wary of them. And, but I mean, at the same time, very much the very captivating cause  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  they're, they're sort of quite beautiful. You know, they're very, you know, they have  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:06):**  a certain charm. They are quite majestic actually. Yeah. They also make a really unusual  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:12):**  sound. I've never heard, I mean, like, don't make this sound. They're almost like a, a croaking sound  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:19):**  or something like that. Like a fog. Yeah. Like almost like a, almost like a frog, which I found  
**[0:04:24-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:24):**  really like interesting and talking to the farmer, he was, he was just so in tune with the whole sort  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:33):**  of ecosystem. He kind of strip grazing where the, he lets an awful lot of his cattle into quite a  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:39):**  small space and they trample down the grass and then, you know, well, they eat some of it and they  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:43):**  trample a little bit down, which returns a lot of organic matter back into the soil. His grandfather  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:49):**  farmed in, in a more sort of traditional or, you know, conventional way,  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:54):**  whereas he's an entirely organic farmer in that sense. Fantastic. Well, let's,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:04:59):**  let's meet these majestic beasts. We took it over and reverted it back to a natural grassland  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:13):**  farming system. Yeah. And we got in the water buffalo, Indian water buffalo, that they've got in  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:20):**  Italy for mozzarella cheese. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a few producers in this country,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  mostly concentrating on milk production, going into the Asian community and that. Okay. And we've  
**[0:05:31-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:31):**  got, we basically run for meat. Okay. And we sell all the meat that they produce locally at farmers  
**[0:05:41-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:41):**  markets and through pubs and restaurants and catering events we do as well. Okay. What we do  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  is we, we put all the herd into one group. So it's about, well, most of it anyway, about 200  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:05:57):**  animals in one group. And we put them onto fresh paddocks each day. This is something they call it  
**[0:06:02-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:02):**  mob grazing. Right. And it's a way of, you get all the animals into a small area and they go in and  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:13):**  they graze it off nice and evenly. They dung all over it. And then they move back, they move on  
**[0:06:20-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:20):**  and they go onto the next bit of ground. And so it then gets a real long rest of two, three months.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:31):**  Okay. And what we're finding is this is kind of, it's feeding the soil and it's kicking the soil  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:38):**  into life and it's gradually, very, very slowly, but we're getting a kind of upturn in productivity  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:47):**  as we start to see the, you know, the effects on it. Yeah. Do you bring them inside or they stay  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:06:54):**  outdoors or winter as well? No, no, they come in. Oh, they do come in. Okay. Got you. We like to build  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:00):**  the shed every so often just to show the local farming community how successful our operation  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:05):**  is. You know, they're glad to come in, but glad to go back out again. Yeah. So it works okay.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  A week or two ago, we went along to the canal side community gardens in Leamington Spa for the CSA  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  network gathering. And one or two conversations got us thinking. Before we get there, CSA means  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:29):**  community supported agriculture. Nigel, what exactly is this? In most traditional farming  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:36):**  systems, agriculture, the risk lies more or less solely with the farmer. What community supported  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:43):**  agriculture is all about is basically sharing that risk. So essentially they work in harmony,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  the farmer and the consumer of that product work together. So essentially the consumer pays a  
**[0:07:55-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:07:55):**  monthly price or an annual price for the harvest and will basically reap the rewards of that  
**[0:08:03-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:03):**  harvest. Or indeed also if the crop fails or doesn't do as well, they also don't then get as  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:13):**  much food as well. And I suppose this has the also added effect of sort of bringing people a lot closer  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  to the process of their food. Like you're aware of what's going on, you're personally involved.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  You know, generally when CSAs are set up and they find local members, the whole point is about sort  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:33):**  of educating the members about that food growing process. And there was a great community feel at  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:40):**  this event wasn't there? There were babies and old people and farmers of all ages. Yeah, yeah,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:47):**  definitely. And well, we went for the party, which was really fun. The Kaylee, yeah. The world dancing  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:53):**  and it was a really great atmosphere. And what actually from the day what kind of excited me most  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:08:59):**  was the idea of, well, for one, people coming and having the opportunity to help out with the farming  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  a few days a year. You know, that's part of often a lot of CSAs, that's part of the commitment.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:12):**  And then also the idea that you could get more involved with what foods you actually want to be  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  planted and the taste of the foods. So like, say you really like the taste of stripy beetroot or  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  something, you have the opportunity to be like, well, let's try planting this at this time. And  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:31):**  you know, getting that kind of really from the moment you're tasting something right back to the  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:37):**  moment it's planted and really connecting that up. I like that kind of two way discussion going on  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  between the people eating and the people growing. But we met some really committed people.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  There's a real movement happening, I think. You know, it seems a lot of young voices, well,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:09:57):**  as Abby mentioned, like a mixture of ages and everyone seemed very upbeat about the future,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  which is great. It was great. And I think we're going to hear from a few of those people now.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:09):**  Let me start with one of the less young voices, but I'm young in spirit. Robert Simpson, who is a  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:17):**  founding member of the CSA network in the UK. You know, you've got to think about something  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  which is very banal, like growing food in this new kind of way that it's actually central. And  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:32):**  like you're saying, this is the connection between the kitchen and the cooking and the growing.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:36):**  So everything is understood in terms of relationships all the time. And that is not  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  the mindset of many or most farmers, you know, they've got it all boxed up.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  What came up a lot on the day was like, what's the difference between a box scheme and a CSA?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  And I think that is something that for a lot of people maybe isn't clear on, you know, first sight.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:10:57):**  But we really got when we were there at the gathering was that actually this is really  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:03):**  something more than just getting vegetable boxes delivered. You're really part of a community and  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:09):**  you're really learning. And there's engagement in both directions. And that's really exciting.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  Now, one thing, one of the stranger things we heard about on the day was also a way of getting  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:19):**  the community involved. And it was a chicken speakeasy. So sort of just mull that over in  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  your mind a minute and think what that might be. And then Nigel's going to tell us.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  So I think the chicken speakeasy was essentially an unofficial sort of abattoir.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:40):**  I can't sell you a processed chicken. Very illegal, very naughty. But I can sell you a live chicken.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:45):**  So he goes, here's your chicken. Oh, what the hell do I do with this?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  One hand on the head and one hand on the body.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:50):**  And then we'll have like the plucking session.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:52):**  The whole point here is that they're not actually slaughtering these animals illegally.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:11:57):**  They're organising parties where people can come round and they can legally slaughter their own animals.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:05):**  There's also a really clear, as far as I could tell, sense of wanting to become part of a system  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:13):**  that in some ways seemed to be almost that the system was too big and the CSA network was so small  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:19):**  that even they had lots of good ideas which really did fit in with lots of the aims of national policy.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:23):**  They're kind of a little bit too small to make that noise loud enough.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:28):**  The system couldn't think in units as small as one grower on a field.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, it was really interesting actually hearing about how efficient the CSA systems were.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:42):**  Comparing those to the food systems we have in place and especially with recent announcements  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:48):**  about the importance of reducing food waste in the UK.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  It was really interesting to hear that actually a CSA system has the lowest food waste.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:12:56):**  Roughly 25% of what supermarkets sell is wasted.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  That's a really significant figure because that's also 25% of their profits.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:11):**  So waste is absolutely fundamental to the supermarket system because if they didn't have  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  if we and that's just our waste not that not the waste before that's just what we wasted home.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:22):**  And that's where we buy 25% if we're buying from supermarkets more than we need.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  Which is perfect for a supermarket because that's actually 25% and that's a massive amount of sale.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:34):**  And of course the whole remit of the supermarket is sell it cheap, sell lots of it and sell it cheap.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  They work on quite pretty small margins, you know, percentage very small margins.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  It's just it's just about bulk. So the system is pretty crap and highly, highly inefficient.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:51):**  Whereas here, what have we got? So the study I did here was was was one bit was very easy  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:13:59):**  to measure what waste was was left in the field.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  Well, it wasn't any.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:07):**  If you've been in there, there is a there's a bean in the corner.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:11):**  And that is the only thing. So occasionally we have a real glut.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:16):**  And sometimes beetroots are a bit hard to move. Even I find it difficult to eat all the beets we get sometimes.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:23):**  There's just a tiny tiny tiny about point zero two percent of what's produced is wasted here.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:31):**  It's just meaningless.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:32):**  That was Nigel talking to us about efficiency and food waste.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:36):**  Any closing thoughts on that?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:38):**  I think it's just about efficiency and food waste.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:41):**  Any closing comments on CSAs? Because I feel it's some it's a movement, an idea which we're going to be returning to.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:49):**  Yeah, I think it has huge potential, just really needs more farmers to actually learn about, you know,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:14:57):**  the potential of setting them up and working with the local community.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  So I think it's one of those systems is a really good idea.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:05):**  It just really needs more people to to adopt the CSA system.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:11):**  And I think it has huge potential to really help feed and teach communities about where their food comes from.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:21):**  Our friend Zahra Rahman has done a historical and political examination of seeds in her podcast, Collusion.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  She kindly let us use a short segment for Farmer Rahman.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:31):**  We wanted to bring this in because many people were really excited,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  especially in the sustainable agriculture kind of section,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:39):**  that the European Union dropped recent proposed regulations on seed varieties.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:45):**  And Zahra shows that the power of seeds is nothing new.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:53):**  Biopiracy is a way to describe the appropriation or use of indigenous forms of knowledge by commercial actors.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:15:59):**  In practice, this could be, for example, scientists or researchers coming to an area  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:04):**  like indigenous communities in Mexico to learn about their medicines and compounds,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:08):**  then taking samples of this back to their research institutions and eventually getting a patent on them.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:19):**  A form of biopiracy is bioprospecting, when researchers find compounds, plants or medicines used by indigenous people  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:27):**  and patent it without recognizing that the knowledge is neither new nor invented by the patenter.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  Somewhat incredibly, this patent might later be used against the community from whom the knowledge was first found,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:39):**  and usually the rights to the commercial profits from this kind of technology are denied to the indigenous community.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  One of the first most well-known cases of biopiracy was the Maya International Cooperative Biodiversity Group.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  It began as an alliance between the University of Georgia in the US, a small Welsh pharmaceutical group  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:05):**  and an NGO intended to represent the indigenous Maya of Chiapas, as well as various US federal agencies.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:12):**  The aim of the project was to promote drug discovery from natural sources,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:17):**  biodiversity conservation and sustainable economic growth in developing countries.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:22):**  But even though the project had a code of ethics and the two main researchers had years of experience  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:27):**  in working with communities in the region, lots of concerns were raised by people within the community.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  The major issue here was the idea of gaining prior informed consent from those communities.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:39):**  According to Sebastien Luna, an indigenous spokesperson from the council,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:43):**  the project is a robbery of traditional indigenous knowledge and resources with the sole purpose  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  of producing pharmaceuticals that will not benefit the communities that have managed and nurtured  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:53):**  these resources for thousands of years. Luna explains in a written statement how the project  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:17:59):**  aimed explicitly at privatising and commercialising knowledge that up until that point had always been  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:04):**  collectively owned, and this move contradicted strongly with the culture and traditions of the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:10):**  communities involved. It was also difficult given that some individual members of the community  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:16):**  took the decision to actually collaborate with the researchers in return for a relatively small  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:20):**  amount of money, but one that made a big difference to their personal economic situations which were  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:25):**  very difficult at the time.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  India started the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library Project, an Indian digital knowledge  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:43):**  repository of the traditional knowledge, especially about medicinal plants and formulations, used in  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:49):**  Indian systems of medicine. It was set up in 2001 and seeks to classify and keep a public record of  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:18:56):**  medicines that have been used for years in India. It protects the traditional knowledge of the country  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:01):**  from exploitation by biopiracy and unethical patents, and it also makes access to the database  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:06):**  much easier than before. It essentially started as a response to biopiracy and patent claims,  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:12):**  for example in the past patents have been granted on turmeric and even basmati rice, and one of the  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:18):**  main obstacles around this issue was that the patent examiners couldn't search through traditional  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:23):**  knowledge to see if it had already existed prior to the patent being brought about. In part this  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:29):**  was because of a language barrier. Traditional Indian knowledge might exist in any local language  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  such as Sanskrit, Urdu, Tamil, whereas the patent examiners likely in these cases coming from the US  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:40):**  were unlikely to be able to understand these languages. Within the traditional knowledge  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  digital library that information is now available in English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese,  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:51):**  meaning that hopefully it's more likely to be used and referred to by patent examiners. It gives  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:19:57):**  modern names to medicines and aims to bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:01):**  knowledges. On their website they've been keeping a record of patents coming largely from the US,  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:06):**  Canada and Europe that have been withdrawn thanks to reference to the traditional knowledge digital  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:11):**  library and up till now they've classified about 200,000 different formulations. Another response  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:18):**  that can be seen among community activists is the establishment of community seed banks aimed at  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  protecting indigenous seeds, helping farmers return to organic farming and reducing dependency upon  
**[0:20:29-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:29):**  multinational corporations. So you heard from Zara her thoughts but what can we do here in the UK?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  Well it turns out people are thinking about just this. I spoke to Ben Raskin of the Soil Association  
**[0:20:53-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  about a new project he's been working on. We did an open pollinated seed variety trial where we  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:03):**  got a whole load of varieties that weren't available organically, tested them in organic  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:07):**  systems and then there were a couple that did really well so we went on to second year and  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  tried those two varieties in more places, more holdings. But it then got me thinking about the  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:18):**  fact that a lot of what this is about is just information sharing and there's no  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:26):**  independent testing of organic varieties now in the UK, there used to be. They cut the funding  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:31):**  about eight years ago. So how do, and it's come up a few times today in discussions, how do you  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:38):**  know what variety of what to grow, you know, and what suits here might not suit down the road,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:42):**  you know, all that sort of stuff. So what I've started an online seed survey. So people basically  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  put in very basic, because the idea is keeping it easy so that people do it, basic information about  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:21:57):**  how varieties perform. So you can literally put in one variety and it would take about a minute  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:01):**  or you can send me a spreadsheet of your whole cropping thing and I'll input it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  And then in theory this will become an online searchable map by location, by soil type,  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:12):**  so heavy, medium or light. And then sort of whether it's been growing inside or outside.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:17):**  So there's a few bits of information that you need to put in that you can then say, right,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  I want to find out carrot varieties that do really well on heavy soil in Lancashire. You zoom in  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:28):**  and people will put them and there'll be a public and a commercial version, both in the same format.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:35):**  So you can merge the data, but also separatable. So that if you're a commercial growing, you really  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:40):**  just want commercial varieties, then you can do it like that. It's early days, but he's keen to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:46):**  expand this project. So if you want to get involved, then post on our Facebook page or Twitter  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:51):**  and we can add you to the list of trialists. The more we speak to farmers, the more we hear about  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:22:55):**  the new ways they are using technology to make their farm work. We think this is particularly  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  exciting for smaller scale farmers. And we've already talked to a few of them who've told us  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:05):**  about the technologies that are keeping them producing. You'll hear from them all in the coming  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  episodes. But for now, our new friend Robert Simpson from the CSA network is also keen on  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  sharing the experimentation in the growing world. I'm convinced that this is the what's happening.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:21):**  The big environment is so ignorant and so unsympathetic. The chances of these experiments,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  you know, having a long life in that environment is kind of, you know, you're against the grain.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:36):**  But the value is that we've trialed all sorts of experiences and experiments. They talk about  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:43):**  ecology and redundancy. So redundancy, that's OK. So what we have to do is to make sure we've got  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:50):**  opportunity to do these experiments. And so, yes, some will be successful and some will not be  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:23:57):**  successful. You know, that's the beauty of it. But what is key to that is this thing, you know,  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:04):**  we've got all the technology. For God's sake, let's record what's going on. Because the moment  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  will come when that unsympathetic and ignorant environment in which all this experimentation is  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:16):**  happening will implode on itself or explode on itself. There'll be some ghastly non-linear,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:24):**  i.e. systemic, if there is a system out there, catastrophe of some kind.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  Quite serious there. And luckily, Farmerama are here to do some of that recording. So hopefully  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  we can save future generations or current generations ourselves from...  
**[0:24:45-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:45):**  Implosion.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:47):**  Explosion.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:49):**  Who knows?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:49):**  That's interesting. And another thing which was really clear from talking to Robert was  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:24:56):**  sometimes when we talk about technology, people are assuming new technology.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:00):**  But Robert really talked to us about rediscovering old and forgotten bits of technology from the past  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:10):**  and seeing how we might be able to make use of that again. Or even simply just making sure we  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  don't forget. Yeah, I think it's really important to remember that everyone kind of thinks technology  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:22):**  means digital in this day and age, but that's just a very recent understanding of the word technology.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:29):**  And that we really need to have a much broader understanding of what technology means. It's  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:33):**  almost like closer to tools than it is to digital, well, in my view. Seeing history as a resource to  
**[0:25:41-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:41):**  re-envisage the future. The now is just between what was and what's to come. And well, what do  
**[0:25:52-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:25:52):**  you want to come? So you learn about the past in order to resource your envisioning of the future.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  And what do you think is the role of technology to play in the future? Because obviously that  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:09):**  wasn't necessarily in the past. New technologies. Well, you're asking me something which is  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:16):**  preoccupying me a lot at the moment because technological innovation is subject to a law  
**[0:26:21-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:21):**  of diminishing returns. It's always the argument that we can grow by substitution. New technology  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:29):**  will find us a new substitute for petroleum, for instance. Problem solving and using technological  
**[0:26:36-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:36):**  fixes as part of the problem solving process is subject to this law. It's not ultimately going  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:48):**  to be a fix, whether there is a fix as such. So it's quite, because I've been reading quite a  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:26:56):**  bit about collapse theory and that's, I think now I'm not comfortable about talking about  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:03):**  sustainability because I think probably much better to use the word resilience really.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:10):**  Because resilience is part of the ecological cycle. There was this famous psychologist called  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:20):**  Buzz Hollings who did this work on American pine forests. I can't remember where it is,  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:25):**  on the East Coast somewhere. And did all the mathematical modelling and discovered that the  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  climax, forest climax stage of development is very, very brittle and unstable and it collapses.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:37):**  So there's climax and collapse and then regeneration and the whole cycle starts again.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:44):**  So there was also a social scientist, a paleoanthropologist who did work in the 90s on  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:51):**  social collapse and he worked out this idea that the pursuit of sustainability is a driver of  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  collapse of complex societies, which is a pretty scary thought to get your head around because,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:05):**  you know, we've listened to the talk about sustainability for so long, but it isn't an  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:12):**  ecological category. You know, there's always this moving through and so resilience is a much more,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:20):**  a much more serviceable idea. So that's why I say, you know, we're going to see some of these  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:26):**  projects fail. This is almost inevitable, but the value will be that we've got actually some  
**[0:28:34-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:34):**  technology which we can record what happened and how it worked, you know, and that will be immensely  
**[0:28:43-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:43):**  important when the collapse stage of our complex society starts to impact. So that may not be my  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:52):**  lifetime, but it's certainly been yours, I should think. Robert has an awful lot to say about an  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:28:56):**  awful lot. We think he's great. So we're going to be hearing more from him over the next few  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:02):**  episodes. Robert and Ben have both in slightly different ways talked about how sharing knowledge  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:08):**  and experience is important. And this is an idea we're really keen on at Parmarama. As we mentioned  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:14):**  at the start of the show, we'd like to hear as many voices as possible and give a feel for what's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:18):**  going on across the whole country. That means we want to hear your voice. So we have a little  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:24):**  request or an opportunity. We'd like to invite people to send in short stories, letting us know  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:31):**  what you've been up to. It could be an explanation on how a new variety of plum is doing or a response  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:38):**  to something you heard on the show or elsewhere, or maybe simply just telling us how much you enjoy  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:44):**  being outdoors. Basically a little news story from the farm out in the field. We want to hear your  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:50):**  experiences. We want to hear from all corners of the country. Just give us a feel for what's going  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:29:56):**  on with you as part of this work you do. It sounds somewhat daunting, but technology-wise,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:03):**  it really is easy enough to make a recording on your iPhone. If you've got something, then let us  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:07):**  know and we'll tell you where to send the files. We're also really happy to help with the  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:13):**  technical questions. So we can't wait to hear what you've been up to.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:30):**  Thank you so much for joining us on what has been the first episode of Farm to Rama.

**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:39):**  episodes. Okay. So just quick, you can find us on Facebook at farmarama radio. And then on Twitter  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:48):**  and Instagram, our handle is at farmarama underscore underscore. So that's two underscores,  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:30:56):**  a really long line. So do once again, at farmarama underscore underscore. We'd love to  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:02):**  hear from you. Farmarama has been made by the three of us. Me, Abby Schlosser,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:08):**  me, Nigel Akerst, and I'm Joe Barrett. We'd like to thank Zara Laman for her feature on Seeds,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:14):**  and our guests this episode, Ben Raskin and Robert Simpson. We'll leave you today with the  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:20):**  Sounds of Ben, this time singing us out with a traditional Irish folk song from the CSA event  
**[0:31:26-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:26):**  the other week.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:31:56):**  We ran from the ex-sides man.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:32:02):**  It's a smuggler's life for me.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:32:06):**  It's a smuggler's life for me.

**[0:32:14-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:32:14):**  It's a smuggler's life for me.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/01-farmerama#t=0:32:22):**  It's a smuggler's life for me.

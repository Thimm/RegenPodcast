### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:00:00):**  This is Pavlos and this is Oliver who came from Ireland together.  Shall we go and meet the guys?  Yeah, let's do it.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:00:39):**  Will you tell me your name and where we are?  I am Dimitris, I am from Thessaloniki.  I am living in the centre of Thessaloniki.  
**[0:00:48-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:00:48):**  And this place is only 10, no 10, 7 kilometres from Thessaloniki.  To continue?  Yeah, and what's the name of the garden?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:01):**  This garden's name is Perka.  Perka means...  How do you say it?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:09):**  It's the very first word.  Very urban cultivations.  Urban gardening.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:14):**  The first letters from two words.  Urban gardening.  Perka.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:19):**  And this place was an army camp.  And the army went 15 years ago.  And 6 years ago we came here, a group of citizens of Thessaloniki.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:37):**  We were looking for a place to plant.  And we found this place. Free.  You know, all this place, the area is 70 hectares.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:49):**  It's very, very big.  It's the biggest free place in Thessaloniki.  If you can see from the Google map.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:00):**  The place, you can understand.  It's near the... not near, it's in Thessaloniki.  So it's 7 hectares.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:09):**  7 hectares.  70 hectares.  No.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:12):**  700.  70 hectares.  70 hectares.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:15):**  It's from here to the mountain.  It's from here to the mountain.  But we start here, the first group, 30 persons with our families.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:27):**  We start to plant here.  Without help.  Only with our work and with our money.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:40):**  We do all.  We take water.  We rebuild some buildings here to put our tools.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:49):**  And we start.  And now there are 7 groups like this.  We are all around after this building.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:59):**  So there's 7 kind of mini gardens within the overall place.  Yes.  So in each, because where we are now, there's how many, like 30 families?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:11):**  Yes, around 35 families.  And this particular plot is about 1 third of a hectare maybe?  Sorry, my English is not very good.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:19):**  How big is this plot?  At the place?  This one.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:22):**  How... this is, I don't know, 2 hectares.  No, no, no hectares.  Look, we are 30 gardeners and we have 40 square meters.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:35):**  Is this the other guy?  Yes.  So we have 1200 square meters all this place.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:42):**  And there's 7 of these...  7 of these groups.  And we cultivate with rules.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:54):**  Is...  Solidarity?  Is solidarity.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:00):**  It isn't a private situation.  We have assemblies.  We decide for all together.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:08):**  And we plant, biological.  We try with traditional Greek seeds, with traditional way.  The places are small, the gardens are small, that we don't use mechanical tools.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:32):**  Only with our heads.  So, I can speak hours.  Let's go to the sound.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:42):**  Yeah.  Wait, let's go to the other side.  Do you feel the noise?  
**[0:04:52-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:52):**  Yes, now this season is the best.  Spring.  And we prepare our garden.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:04):**  We plant summer legumes.  You know, tomatoes, gogobers, obalgins, peppers.  And it's very nice to be here.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:19):**  It's easy.  For me and for my family, for my children, here is our village.  Because we have chicken too.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:30):**  We have garden for the children.  We have kitchen.  We make parties here.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:39):**  It's very nice place.  Katafigio?  It's a shelter, a refuge.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:46):**  Yes, it's for all us.  Because you know, we are living in apartments.  Thessaloniki is full of cement.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:54):**  There are no free places.  And for us, here is paradise.  It's very nice how you combine different plants.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:03):**  Like this one.  No, this is Rikinus communus.  Rikinus communus.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:10):**  Rikinoladia.  And I love this, this is the most toxic plant in the world.  Castor oil.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:19):**  Castor oil, yes.  Castor oil is used for Rikinoladia.  Because it replaced the drug.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:30):**  And...  We try.  And the way to care...  
**[0:06:37-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:37):**  Why you put the castor oil?  I put the castor oil... I love this...  How do you say the plant?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:46):**  Rikinus.  Yes.  No, the word plant. How is it?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:50):**  The plant.  The plant.  This will be high like this.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:55):**  This is from last year.  Because died, at the winter, died.  I plant in these lines to have shadow.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:05):**  Because the summer in Greece is very hot.  And we need shadow for the legumes.  And I plant this to be high.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:14):**  And I work in the shadow.  And the shadow for the legumes is good.  Is it also used as a natural for insects?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:24):**  Yes, yes.  And sometimes I plant beans.  Beans?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:33):**  Yes, green beans.  To go up.  So where is your plot?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:39):**  This one here.  From this, from here, there, there.  40 square meters.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:47):**  It's enough for one family.  If you work every day, you have legumes.  Summer and winter too.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:57):**  Vegetables.  Vegetables, yes.  It's okay for one family.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:02):**  And here isn't only the gardening.  It's our target.  We have three targets.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:16):**  To gardening, to have vegetables,  clean vegetables for our families.  To protect this place.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:27):**  To not...  You know, because the economic crisis in Greece,  governments, governments,  
**[0:08:38-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:38):**  and some guys want to sell these places.  And we want these places green.  And we protect this army camp to be green.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:51):**  And we fight.  All these six years we fight.  We make...  
**[0:09:01-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:01):**  Rallies, protests.  And interviews and festivals.  And the third target is to meet the people in Greece,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:15):**  that they live in cities, big cities,  that to have urban gardenings is very easy.  It's very easy.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:25):**  It's simple to be a group with ten persons,  to find a free place, and to go there to plant.  It's very easy if they believe this  
**[0:09:37-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:37):**  and if they want to do this.  To not be afraid about this.  So we've walked up to the top end of this,  
**[0:09:49-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:49):**  one of several allotment areas in the park.  And so what have we seen up here now?  So we walked up to the garden's depth.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:00):**  It describes the landscape.  So what do we see here?  This is a garden for our children.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:07):**  We planted this last weekend.  We have a festival here.  We have a festival every year here.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:17):**  And our children, we plant this.  And the children come to take care about the vegetables.  But we have...  
**[0:10:29-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:29):**  You know, we go to the schools and we talk about the vegetables.  We prepare school gardens with children.  Schools come here.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:41):**  We go to the refugees' camps  to help them to make gardens.  And now came a group with young refugees.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:58):**  Without refugees' children,  from 12 to 16 children from Syria and Afghanistan,  without parents.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:11):**  They came here with...  With their guides.  Yes. And now they adopted this garden  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:22):**  and they take care about this garden now.  And yesterday was there.  For that they do this.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:30):**  And we have this for our children.  So this is a little play area.  Yes. But you know, the children play and learn.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:42):**  The secrets. To be together.  Do you have any plans to expand this?  Because obviously 70 hectares...  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:56):**  What will be expanded?  Yes, to expand slowly.  There are people that want to come to gardening here.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:04):**  A guy before you asked me.  They walk around here and they like this situation  and they ask us how can I do the same.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:13):**  The problem is...  The place is 70 hectares.  For thousands of people.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:22):**  For thousands of gardeners.  But the problem is the water.  The water is not enough.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:27):**  We take water from the earth.  The water.  Yes.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:33):**  And we put hoses in all gardens.  One kilometer.  With our work and with our money.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:43):**  All this.  And the water is not enough for the summer.  You know, the summer in Greece is very hot.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:49):**  We need water. It is not enough.  It is enough only for these gardens.  And we will see.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:57):**  Something special in this place is that...  You know, when we came here...  We talked with the municipality.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:05):**  We gave them a letter that we are a group.  We do this.  You can see what we can do.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:13):**  It is not a secret.  It is not dangerous.  We planned with our children.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:19):**  But there is a problem with the priority of this place.  There is a fight between the army and the government.  It does not belong to the municipality.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:35):**  It belongs to the army or to the government.  It is not the same in Greece.  And the army came sometimes here with police.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:42):**  And asked us to go.  And we...  We gathered.  
**[0:13:49-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:49):**  We collected all together and we said no, we don't go.  Three or four times they came.  We will see.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:00):**  About the future is not certain for this place.  We will see.  We will fight.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:13):**  We will fight every day.  If we are here every day.  This means something for all these people.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:20):**  They want to buy or to sell this place.  We will see.  Can you tell me about the structure that you use to organize the place?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:32):**  The people who are here now who have plots.  They are all members of an association.  Presumably.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:39):**  What if somebody wants to leave.  If they move to a different city.  How does the plot transfer to other people and so on?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:47):**  We have assemblies.  Every month.  We all...  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:55):**  Here is Perka one.  Perka two, Perka six, seven.  Every month all Perkas.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:02):**  We have one assembly.  And we talk about our problems.  Our targets.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:09):**  And two times a year.  Spring and autumn.  We call the new people that want to come to cultivate.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:21):**  To meet them.  But before we ask the people around Perkas.  Who lives.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:29):**  And we...  Collect the free gardens.  And we give them to the new people.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:43):**  So there is a list?  Yes, there is a waiting list.  How long is it? How big?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:49):**  After our festival last week.  We have twenty persons that are waiting.  You know...  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:00):**  Perka after six years is a little famous in Thessaloniki.  And people come.  If we have place...  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:09):**  One thousand maybe.  It's a matter of access to water.  Yes.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:15):**  This is the most limiting factor.  Yes, to water.  First is the water.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:21):**  Second...  There are very nice...  It's a very good situation all this.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:27):**  People are annoyed.  Each other.  People...  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:33):**  We have students.  We have professors of...  University.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:39):**  Retired.  We have unemployed.  We have women.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:49):**  We have old men.  You know, from all levels of...  Community of Thessaloniki.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:57):**  And...  This is good here.  But what do you want to tell?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:05):**  Why did we speak before?  Is it an association?  What do you mean?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:11):**  A formal organization?  No, no, no.  It's not something typical.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:17):**  It's informal.  You know...  There are some problems.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:25):**  If we have...  If we make some typical organization...  We need money.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:31):**  We need papers to give to the government every month.  We decided here to...  To put money for our...  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:39):**  Pockets.  Little money.  Now the new guys that...  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:45):**  Came to garden give...  Here to Perkawan...  15 euros for one year.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:53):**  15? 15.  1.5.  To have some money if...  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:59):**  We have some problem with the water...  To buy tools for this.  So let me ask, is 40 meters...  
**[0:18:05-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:05):**  This is 40 meters.  Enough for a family of like 4 people?  40 is enough.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:13):**  The problem is when the...  Seasons change.  Like now.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:19):**  Because now I have...  Winter legumes.  And I want place to put...  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:25):**  Summer legumes.  Only this season there is the problem.  If I have double...  
**[0:18:33-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:33):**  I have one free to put.  But it's enough.  Here people that work too much...  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:41):**  You know...  Unemployed.  Or retired people...  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:47):**  Are here all day.  This guy there is from 6 o'clock...  Until midnight.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:53):**  He lives near here.  All day here.  And work all day.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:59):**  And take care of...  And he has...  Food for all year.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:05):**  And give to the neighbors too.  Can you have more than one plot?  Should we have more than one?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:11):**  No.  No, we decide no.  To be...  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:17):**  Equal.  Yes.  You know...  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:23):**  As all...  Communities we have some problems.  With some members.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:29):**  We have rules but...  You know...  Some guys in 150 families here...  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:35):**  They don't take care about our rules.  Very much.  This is...  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:41):**  Usual problem.  But we talk about this.  Don't fight.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:47):**  We have no...  Exit procedures.  No exit process.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:53):**  We talk...  We talk...  We talk about this situation.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:59):**  This season.  Because we have some problems.  We say that we don't make...  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:05):**  Big constructions.  And these guys...  Made.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:11):**  Because...  If I am here...  And this guy make a high...  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:17):**  Construction.  I have problem...  Me too.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:23):**  This guys don't take care.  They are all day...  Very big.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:29):**  With goods.  Chemicals no.  They don't put...  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:35):**  So nobody uses...  Fertilizers or pesticides or herbicides.  Sorry?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:41):**  Nobody uses the fertilizers...  Or pesticides or herbicides.  The biocide.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:47):**  The insecticide.  We don't use chemicals.  Biological style.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:53):**  There are not too much...  Insects.  We have no problem.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:59):**  I never put nothing.  If I need something I will make...  You know a traditional way with...  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:05):**  Some...  Spices.  And for...  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:11):**  How is it?  Fertilizer.  We use...  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:17):**  We use...  We use...  Manure.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:23):**  Compost.  We make compost there.  And from animals.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:29):**  So there are just chickens as the only animals?  Only chickens from animals.  Yes we have some chickens...  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:35):**  Here for...  Eggs only for eggs.  And for children.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:41):**  We try to make a situation like...  A village.  This is good.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:47):**  So the chicken belongs to all of them?  Yes to all.  How many?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:53):**  Chicken?  Three and one cock now.  Does each of the seven plots...  
**[0:21:59-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:59):**  Have animals as well? Have chickens?  Sorry?  Only three from seven.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:07):**  They have three.  But you know...  We talk about this...  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:13):**  This season.  Because some guys want to put more chicken.  And...  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:21):**  You know if the community...  Megaloni grows up.  There are some problems.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:27):**  You cannot control...  Easier.  And some guys in the corner there...  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:33):**  Put more chicken.  And we say here...  Here we plan to eat our families.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:39):**  Not to sell.  If we have more...  We give them to the refugees.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:45):**  To some guys that they have...  Necessity.  That they need.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:51):**  And...  If we have...  Thirty chickens...  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:22:57):**  Some day.  We have thirty eggs.  Maybe some guy think to sell.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:03):**  And we don't...  Want to sell here.  We try here to have a community...  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:09):**  Differently.  And differently.  Than the community out of Perka.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:15):**  To try to...  To do something...  Without money.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:21):**  Without priority.  Without egoism.  We say here that we cultivate...  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:31):**  Legumes and we cultivate...  Human relationships.  Correct? Okay.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:39):**  We try.  In Greece...  It's very difficult.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:45):**  Because the first in our world...  Is the priority.  The privacy.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:23:57):**  The privatization and the egoism.  Here we fight this situation.  To make...  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:07):**  The situation in Perka.  Isn't to have food.  Only.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:13):**  Is a place to...  To...  To have something...  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:19):**  A creative occupation.  Different occupation.  To go to the beach.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:27):**  To go to the cafeteria.  Or to go to the cafes.  For us and for our children.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:33):**  So...  We must stop to do...  All this...  
**[0:24:39-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:39):**  That the people do...  To the gardens out of Perka.  We take care to...  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:47):**  To have...  Product.  With...  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:53):**  Assemblies solutions.  Good?  Come to show you.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:24:59):**  We plant here tomatoes.  Tomatoes...  Peppers...  
**[0:25:05-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:05):**  Summers...  What I think is very interesting in Greece is that...  Seeds are exchanged for free.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:13):**  Is not like other countries that...  There is a small fee.  To get a...  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:19):**  Small bag of seeds.  So those guys are growing...  Seedlings.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:25):**  Which are given for free.  And here is written also.  To take...  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:31):**  Pumpkins, tomatoes...  So take for free.  And you can see all those plants here.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah.  So people like...  This one behind is...  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:43):**  So it is...  I have seed of...  Seeds for free.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:49):**  Seeds for free.  Seeds of freedom.  And we take seeds...  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:25:57):**  We keep the seeds.  We keep the seeds.  Not too much but we try.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:26:03):**  We take seeds from...  Peliti.  Ok and from other people.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:26:09):**  Because there are...  Now this year...  There are people that have...  
**[0:26:15-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:26:15):**  Traditional Greek seeds.

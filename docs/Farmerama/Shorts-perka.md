**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:00:00):**  This is Pavlos and this is Oliver who came from Ireland together.  Shall we go and meet the guys?  Yeah, let's do it.  Will you tell me your name and where we are?  I am Dimitris, I am from Thessaloniki.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:00:45):**  I am living in the centre of Thessaloniki.  And this place is only 10, no 10, 7 kilometres from Thessaloniki.  To continue?  Yeah, and what's the name of the garden?  This garden's name is Perka.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:04):**  Perka means...  How do you say it?  It's the very first word.  Very urban cultivations.  Urban gardening.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:14):**  The first letters from two words.  Urban gardening.  Perka.  And this place was an army camp.  And the army went 15 years ago.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:29):**  And 6 years ago we came here, a group of citizens of Thessaloniki.  We were looking for a place to plant.  And we found this place. Free.  You know, all this place, the area is 70 hectares.  It's very, very big.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:01:51):**  It's the biggest free place in Thessaloniki.  If you can see from the Google map.  The place, you can understand.  It's near the... not near, it's in Thessaloniki.  So it's 7 hectares.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:09):**  7 hectares.  70 hectares.  No.  700.  70 hectares.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:14):**  70 hectares.  It's from here to the mountain.  It's from here to the mountain.  But we start here, the first group, 30 persons with our families.  We start to plant here.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:30):**  Without help.  Only with our work and with our money.  We do all.  We take water.  We rebuild some buildings here to put our tools.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:02:49):**  And we start.  And now there are 7 groups like this.  We are all around after this building.  So there's 7 kind of mini gardens within the overall place.  Yes.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:05):**  So in each, because where we are now, there's how many, like 30 families?  Yes, around 35 families.  And this particular plot is about 1 third of a hectare maybe?  Sorry, my English is not very good.  How big is this plot?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:20):**  At the place?  This one.  How... this is, I don't know, 2 hectares.  No, no, no hectares.  Look, we are 30 gardeners and we have 40 square meters.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:35):**  Is this the other guy?  Yes.  So we have 1200 square meters all this place.  And there's 7 of these...  7 of these groups.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:03:47):**  And we cultivate with rules.  Is...  Solidarity?  Is solidarity.  It isn't a private situation.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:03):**  We have assemblies.  We decide for all together.  And we plant, biological.  We try with traditional Greek seeds, with traditional way.  The places are small, the gardens are small, that we don't use mechanical tools.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:32):**  Only with our heads.  So, I can speak hours.  Let's go to the sound.  Yeah.  Wait, let's go to the other side.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:04:51):**  Do you feel the noise?  Yes, now this season is the best.  Spring.  And we prepare our garden.  We plant summer legumes.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:09):**  You know, tomatoes, gogobers, obalgins, peppers.  And it's very nice to be here.  It's easy.  For me and for my family, for my children, here is our village.  Because we have chicken too.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:30):**  We have garden for the children.  We have kitchen.  We make parties here.  It's very nice place.  Katafigio?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:43):**  It's a shelter, a refuge.  Yes, it's for all us.  Because you know, we are living in apartments.  Thessaloniki is full of cement.  There are no free places.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:05:56):**  And for us, here is paradise.  It's very nice how you combine different plants.  Like this one.  No, this is Rikinus communus.  Rikinus communus.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:10):**  Rikinoladia.  And I love this, this is the most toxic plant in the world.  Castor oil.  Castor oil, yes.  Castor oil is used for Rikinoladia.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:27):**  Because it replaced the drug.  And...  We try.  And the way to care...  Why you put the castor oil?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:39):**  I put the castor oil... I love this...  How do you say the plant?  Rikinus.  Yes.  No, the word plant. How is it?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:06:50):**  The plant.  The plant.  This will be high like this.  This is from last year.  Because died, at the winter, died.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:01):**  I plant in these lines to have shadow.  Because the summer in Greece is very hot.  And we need shadow for the legumes.  And I plant this to be high.  And I work in the shadow.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:17):**  And the shadow for the legumes is good.  Is it also used as a natural for insects?  Yes, yes.  And sometimes I plant beans.  Beans?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:33):**  Yes, green beans.  To go up.  So where is your plot?  This one here.  From this, from here, there, there.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:45):**  40 square meters.  It's enough for one family.  If you work every day, you have legumes.  Summer and winter too.  Vegetables.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:07:58):**  Vegetables, yes.  It's okay for one family.  And here isn't only the gardening.  It's our target.  We have three targets.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:16):**  To gardening, to have vegetables,  clean vegetables for our families.  To protect this place.  To not...  You know, because the economic crisis in Greece,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:36):**  governments, governments,  and some guys want to sell these places.  And we want these places green.  And we protect this army camp to be green.  And we fight.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:08:53):**  All these six years we fight.  We make...  Rallies, protests.  And interviews and festivals.  And the third target is to meet the people in Greece,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:15):**  that they live in cities, big cities,  that to have urban gardenings is very easy.  It's very easy.  It's simple to be a group with ten persons,  to find a free place, and to go there to plant.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:33):**  It's very easy if they believe this  and if they want to do this.  To not be afraid about this.  So we've walked up to the top end of this,  one of several allotment areas in the park.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:09:54):**  And so what have we seen up here now?  So we walked up to the garden's depth.  It describes the landscape.  So what do we see here?  This is a garden for our children.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:07):**  We planted this last weekend.  We have a festival here.  We have a festival every year here.  And our children, we plant this.  And the children come to take care about the vegetables.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:26):**  But we have...  You know, we go to the schools and we talk about the vegetables.  We prepare school gardens with children.  Schools come here.  We go to the refugees' camps  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:10:45):**  to help them to make gardens.  And now came a group with young refugees.  Without refugees' children,  from 12 to 16 children from Syria and Afghanistan,  without parents.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:11):**  They came here with...  With their guides.  Yes. And now they adopted this garden  and they take care about this garden now.  And yesterday was there.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:27):**  For that they do this.  And we have this for our children.  So this is a little play area.  Yes. But you know, the children play and learn.  The secrets. To be together.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:11:50):**  Do you have any plans to expand this?  Because obviously 70 hectares...  What will be expanded?  Yes, to expand slowly.  There are people that want to come to gardening here.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:04):**  A guy before you asked me.  They walk around here and they like this situation  and they ask us how can I do the same.  The problem is...  The place is 70 hectares.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:18):**  For thousands of people.  For thousands of gardeners.  But the problem is the water.  The water is not enough.  We take water from the earth.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:30):**  The water.  Yes.  And we put hoses in all gardens.  One kilometer.  With our work and with our money.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:43):**  All this.  And the water is not enough for the summer.  You know, the summer in Greece is very hot.  We need water. It is not enough.  It is enough only for these gardens.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:12:54):**  And we will see.  Something special in this place is that...  You know, when we came here...  We talked with the municipality.  We gave them a letter that we are a group.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:09):**  We do this.  You can see what we can do.  It is not a secret.  It is not dangerous.  We planned with our children.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:19):**  But there is a problem with the priority of this place.  There is a fight between the army and the government.  It does not belong to the municipality.  It belongs to the army or to the government.  It is not the same in Greece.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:40):**  And the army came sometimes here with police.  And asked us to go.  And we...  We gathered.  We collected all together and we said no, we don't go.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:13:52):**  Three or four times they came.  We will see.  About the future is not certain for this place.  We will see.  We will fight.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:13):**  We will fight every day.  If we are here every day.  This means something for all these people.  They want to buy or to sell this place.  We will see.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:26):**  Can you tell me about the structure that you use to organize the place?  The people who are here now who have plots.  They are all members of an association.  Presumably.  What if somebody wants to leave.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:41):**  If they move to a different city.  How does the plot transfer to other people and so on?  We have assemblies.  Every month.  We all...  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:14:55):**  Here is Perka one.  Perka two, Perka six, seven.  Every month all Perkas.  We have one assembly.  And we talk about our problems.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:07):**  Our targets.  And two times a year.  Spring and autumn.  We call the new people that want to come to cultivate.  To meet them.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:23):**  But before we ask the people around Perkas.  Who lives.  And we...  Collect the free gardens.  And we give them to the new people.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:43):**  So there is a list?  Yes, there is a waiting list.  How long is it? How big?  After our festival last week.  We have twenty persons that are waiting.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:15:57):**  You know...  Perka after six years is a little famous in Thessaloniki.  And people come.  If we have place...  One thousand maybe.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:11):**  It's a matter of access to water.  Yes.  This is the most limiting factor.  Yes, to water.  First is the water.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:21):**  Second...  There are very nice...  It's a very good situation all this.  People are annoyed.  Each other.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:31):**  People...  We have students.  We have professors of...  University.  Retired.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:43):**  We have unemployed.  We have women.  We have old men.  You know, from all levels of...  Community of Thessaloniki.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:16:57):**  And...  This is good here.  But what do you want to tell?  Why did we speak before?  Is it an association?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:09):**  What do you mean?  A formal organization?  No, no, no.  It's not something typical.  It's informal.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:19):**  You know...  There are some problems.  If we have...  If we make some typical organization...  We need money.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:31):**  We need papers to give to the government every month.  We decided here to...  To put money for our...  Pockets.  Little money.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:43):**  Now the new guys that...  Came to garden give...  Here to Perkawan...  15 euros for one year.  15? 15.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:17:55):**  1.5.  To have some money if...  We have some problem with the water...  To buy tools for this.  So let me ask, is 40 meters...  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:05):**  This is 40 meters.  Enough for a family of like 4 people?  40 is enough.  The problem is when the...  Seasons change.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:17):**  Like now.  Because now I have...  Winter legumes.  And I want place to put...  Summer legumes.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:27):**  Only this season there is the problem.  If I have double...  I have one free to put.  But it's enough.  Here people that work too much...  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:41):**  You know...  Unemployed.  Or retired people...  Are here all day.  This guy there is from 6 o'clock...  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:18:51):**  Until midnight.  He lives near here.  All day here.  And work all day.  And take care of...  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:01):**  And he has...  Food for all year.  And give to the neighbors too.  Can you have more than one plot?  Should we have more than one?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:11):**  No.  No, we decide no.  To be...  Equal.  Yes.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:21):**  You know...  As all...  Communities we have some problems.  With some members.  We have rules but...  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:31):**  You know...  Some guys in 150 families here...  They don't take care about our rules.  Very much.  This is...  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:41):**  Usual problem.  But we talk about this.  Don't fight.  We have no...  Exit procedures.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:19:51):**  No exit process.  We talk...  We talk...  We talk about this situation.  This season.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:01):**  Because we have some problems.  We say that we don't make...  Big constructions.  And these guys...  Made.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:11):**  Because...  If I am here...  And this guy make a high...  Construction.  I have problem...

**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:31):**  Chemicals no.  They don't put...  So nobody uses...  Fertilizers or pesticides or herbicides.  Sorry?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:41):**  Nobody uses the fertilizers...  Or pesticides or herbicides.  The biocide.  The insecticide.  We don't use chemicals.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:20:51):**  Biological style.  There are not too much...  Insects.  We have no problem.  I never put nothing.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:01):**  If I need something I will make...  You know a traditional way with...  Some...  Spices.  And for...  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-perka#t=0:21:11):**  How is it?  Fertilizer.  We use...  We use...  We use...

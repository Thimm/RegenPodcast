## Shorts: Blue Corn  
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:00):**  The corn, yeah, we've had a lot of fun with that because we're not from a culture or an  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:12):**  ethnicity that typically uses a lot of corn, cooked corn.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:17):**  So just developing recipes and finding different ways to use it has been rewarding.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:24):**  And just learning about the grain itself.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:26):**  It's not something that we grew up with.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:28):**  It's not something we'd ever seen.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:29):**  It's not something that...  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:31):**  So just learning how to use it and how to work with it and how to promote it, it's been  
**[0:00:35-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:35):**  a journey for sure.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:36):**  You guys have decided to go down the route of creating tortilla chips, which I think  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:41):**  is really cool because it's a staple and a lot of people love tortilla chips, but again,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:45):**  there's a lot of stuff in them quite often.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:48):**  So you guys went to a traditional Mexican place to have them made?  
**[0:00:55-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:00:55):**  Well most of the commercial tortillas that are made or the chips or the nachos, some  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:02):**  people call them tortilla chips, some call them nacho chips, however, that are made or  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:08):**  certainly that are available on a commercial level are all made with a masa flour.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:13):**  There's absolutely no company in Canada that makes masa flour.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:17):**  So again, it's all being imported from the US or from offshore.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:21):**  So it comes back to why are we doing that?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:25):**  We're producing...  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:27):**  We have the ability to grow a flour or grow a grain that can produce that flour, but it's  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:32):**  the lack of manufacturing facility.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:35):**  But more and more what I came to realize in the research and everything, the availability  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:40):**  of the nutrients from the corn is released in a different way when the corn is actually  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:46):**  cooked and they call that wet milling where you cook the corn in a lime, it breaks down  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:51):**  the starches and then it's ground into a fine meal.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:01:57):**  So the digestibility of it is that much more absorbable for the gut of the human.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:03):**  What is really interesting to me is that was intuition from...  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:06):**  Or skills that the Mexicans and a lot of the natives knew for thousands of years, they  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:10):**  were already doing that.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:12):**  So I think that that's one of the biggest things that when people eat our corn chips,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:15):**  they can't believe the difference of the taste, the flavor.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:18):**  And it was a small manufacturer that's been doing it that way for 20 years.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:24):**  And the fact that they're using a cold pressed sunflower oil that's grown on another farm  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:28):**  as opposed to a cheap byproduct or a cheap oil, again, it's the complete chip.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:35):**  And we have family members that do struggle with food issues and with digestive issues  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:40):**  and when they're able to eat that product again, you feel good because you know, okay,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/blue-corn#t=0:02:45):**  this is something that isn't causing more problems.

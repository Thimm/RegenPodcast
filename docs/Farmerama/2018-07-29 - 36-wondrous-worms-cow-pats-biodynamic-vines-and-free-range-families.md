**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama, our third birthday edition supported by Revel Kitchen.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:09):**  This month we hear from the Worm Lady, Jackie Stroud.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:13):**  We get some tips on cow paths and profitability from a Missouri based mob grazer.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:18):**  We hear some thoughts on regenerative agriculture from the owner of a biodynamic vineyard in  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:22):**  California.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:23):**  And we have the latest update from Jubilee Farm in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:36):**  Can I just say first how great it is that we're all here together in the same room  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:40):**  along with Bessie the Farmerama dog, who doesn't make any noise, you won't know she's here.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:47):**  Yes, so good to be here, so good to see you both and to record together.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:52):**  It's the first time it's ever happened, I think.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:00:54):**  So yeah, it's nice to be here and not on the other end of a laptop for once.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:14):**  So before we start, Abby, a couple of the interviews in this show come from the groundswell  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:20):**  conference that you were at quite recently.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:22):**  So maybe you want to just tell us a little bit about that.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:24):**  Yeah, I was at the groundswell conference, which is the no-till conference organised  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:29):**  by the Cherry family in Hertfordshire.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:32):**  It's quite unlike any other conference, they really know about their farming, obviously,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:36):**  as a farming family.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:37):**  And so they bring amazing speakers from all over the world to talk about soil health.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:43):**  And some of them are quite forward thinking.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:45):**  Was it fun?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:47):**  It was really fun.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:48):**  It's a brilliant two days and there's just people from all types of agriculture there.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:01:56):**  Definitely a good mix of conventional and organic farmers, all really sharing their  
**[0:02:01-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:01):**  knowledge.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:10):**  Jackie Stroud is a soil scientist at Rothamsted Research and renowned in the UK farming community  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:16):**  as the Worm Lady.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:18):**  She recently ran a citizen science project with farmers around the country.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:23):**  It was called hashtag 60 min worms.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:28):**  And the goal was to encourage farmers to count the number of worms in their soil.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:32):**  Her particular focus is on recording the types of worms present.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:36):**  And she's created a wonderfully simple quiz to help you learn how to identify them.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:42):**  It's all good fun, but ultimately it's about the very serious issue of monitoring and building  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:47):**  soil health.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:50):**  You do a lot of soil sampling and digging holes.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:02:57):**  And I was finding some soils that are absolutely, you know, colander-like.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:00):**  They're full of life and biodiversity.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:02):**  Whereas other soils I was digging were just like a solid block.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:06):**  And there's not really much life on there.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:07):**  And as a soil scientist, that's quite boring.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:09):**  But also it really shows me there's something not quite right.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:12):**  And worms are such a great indicator of soils.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:14):**  I really hope to study them and also help other people look at their soils to understand  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:18):**  them.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:19):**  A key thing with earthworm counts is just getting in there and looking at soils.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:23):**  And with my earthworm count, I suggest 10 pits across the field.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:26):**  So you get a really good average and you can see compaction issues, texture differences,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:30):**  which sometimes people haven't looked at before.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:32):**  Worm populations are very variable.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:34):**  So when you do a count, you need to do quite a lot of counting to get a really good representative  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:38):**  answer.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:39):**  For example, you can find two worms in one pit and 20 worms in the next pit.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:43):**  And that can be quite hard to interpret, which is why digging a bit deeper and looking at  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:46):**  the types of worms you have can tell you a little bit more about what's going on in your  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:50):**  soils.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:51):**  There are three types of worms.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:53):**  There's the type which is a litter-feeding worm.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:55):**  So it needs litter on the soil surface.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:03:57):**  So soil management practices include cultivation.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:00):**  So you're burying that litter layer.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:01):**  There's nothing for them to eat.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:02):**  So their populations can decline.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:05):**  And then you've got your topsoil worms.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:06):**  These are really important for nutrient mobilisation and they're just working their way, churning  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:10):**  up that topsoil layer.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:12):**  And that's why you dig holes to find them, because that's where they live.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:16):**  And then you've got the deep-borrowing worms.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:17):**  And they're also highly prized by farmers because they're known as the drainage worms.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:21):**  So they're the ones that help stop that standing water and help wick that water to the drains  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:26):**  in the soils.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:27):**  And that group, particularly Lumbricus trestris, the lobworm, that's really vulnerable to soil  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:31):**  management practices because, again, it eats the litter.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:34):**  So burying that.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:35):**  But also it has quite a slow life cycle, which is why once its population starts to decline,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:39):**  you can sort of see a continued decline and it slowly builds up over time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:44):**  So by looking at the three different types of worms you have, you can tell you a little  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:47):**  bit about if you've perhaps over-cultivated in the past and have impacted your worm community.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:52):**  Each one has a specific role.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:54):**  So as I said, we've got the drainage worms, which make deep vertical burrows in the soil.  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:58):**  And that's quite a unique property.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:04:59):**  The other types of worms don't do that.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:01):**  Those worms will dig up to six foot in the soil, maybe two metres deep.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:05):**  They keep those channels permanent because they live in them their whole lives, maintaining  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:09):**  that open burrow.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:10):**  So that's really quite a unique role, which is why having those in the system is important.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:14):**  Whereas the litter-feeding worms, if you have surface litter, you'd like that to be broken  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:18):**  down to help the crops emerge.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:19):**  So that's another key feature.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:21):**  And then mixing all that soil together, breaking down the nutrients, aggregating the soil,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:26):**  that's what the topsoil worms do.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:27):**  So by seeing all the different groups, each one has a unique function.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:31):**  So that's what's quite a good idea, to have all three.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:34):**  So the first step is you can only identify adult worms.

**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:41):**  is a 20 centimetre by 20 centimetre soil pit.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:45):**  And of those 10 worms, maybe only two or three are adults.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:48):**  And to tell an adult, what you're looking for is the saddle, which is sort of thickened  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:51):**  reproductive ring on it.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:53):**  And if your worms have got a saddle, then you can take it to the next step and identify  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:56):**  what type it is.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:57):**  Now they're quite easy to distinguish.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:05:59):**  The litter type, they're usually red in colour.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:02):**  That's a good camouflage colour.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:03):**  You can imagine they're quite good bird food being on the surface.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:06):**  So they're red, a little bit of protection from the sun, like a sort of sun tan.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:09):**  And they're quite fast moving.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:10):**  Again, they're easily predated.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:12):**  So they're fast moving and red.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:14):**  Then we've got the topsoil worms.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:15):**  Now they live in the soil, so they're often much more paler in colour, or green colour.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:19):**  So they're pale or green.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:21):**  And their size, they can range from sort of a matchstick size through to that of a pen  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:25):**  sort of size.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:26):**  So they can grow quite large, but generally closer to the size of a matchstick.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:30):**  And then finally the deep-boring worms.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:31):**  Again, they can have a dark head.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:33):**  They're litter feeding, like that sort of sun tan type thing.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:36):**  So a black head or a red head.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:38):**  And they're large worms.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:39):**  They can be either long and thin, or shorter and fatter.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:42):**  But again, at least the size of a pen would be the adult-sized worm there.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:47):**  There's a new HDB leaflet called How to Count Worms, which is based on our worm survey,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:51):**  bringing all that feedback from farmers.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:53):**  So it's got some really nice pictures there, so you can help get your eye in.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:06:56):**  And then just based on the feedback, I've made a fun interactive quiz, which is just  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:00):**  15 questions from pictures I've taken in the lab and in the field of worms with the answers.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:06):**  So you can have a practice go before you go out to the field.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:09):**  And that will help speed things up when you're out there, because you've got your eye in,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:11):**  you know what you're looking for already.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:13):**  You can't manage them all year round.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:14):**  That is a downside.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:15):**  For example, this time of year, it's not an appropriate time of year to look for earthworms,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:20):**  because most of them are hibernating.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:21):**  So that's when it doesn't really work.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:23):**  But in the UK, earthworms are endemic across this country.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:27):**  I think we've got 28 different species in this country.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:30):**  So that's why they're quite a useful indicator, because there's no reason why they shouldn't  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:34):**  really be in your soils.

**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:42):**  I just strongly encourage people just to go out there and have a look at your soils.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:46):**  I recommend using a fork instead of a spade for when you look at your field, because you  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:07:50):**  chop less worms in half.

**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:09:42):**  Well, I can tell you what.

**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:12):**  of the microbes such that they are doing the work, extracting the carbon, building the  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:18):**  humus, which expands the water holding capacity, so therefore I don't have to irrigate.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:24):**  So the process that I'm using for that is, one is I build compost, and so we do an annual  
**[0:17:30-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:30):**  compost structuring using pumice and cow manure and straw, and we build about three  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:41):**  tons per acre that we spread in the fall right after harvest.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:45):**  We also graze the animals throughout the winter, we use sheep, we have a flock of about 50  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:50):**  sheep that we run through the vineyards.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:53):**  Additionally, we'll use biodynamic preps, which we think is a significant piece to the  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:17:58):**  fertility.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:00):**  And now we're changing up our cultivation practices in order to reduce the amount of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:09):**  cultivation, so we've cut our cultivation in half.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:13):**  So every other row is what we call a permanent cover, and this is our third year.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:18):**  My concern there was that, and what we've always said in grape farming is that if you  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:24):**  don't cultivate, you're going to get wicking and you're going to lose moisture, and I thought  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:29):**  it would impact my vigor, but I'm actually finding that it's not impacting the vigor  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:35):**  at all, and I've got about the same amount of vigor that I've always had.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:39):**  So the philosophy here is that we want the vine roots to penetrate as deep as they possibly  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:44):**  can in order to extract as much flavor and minerality from this property.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:49):**  So in winemaking, we say, we use the term terroir, and terroir means the expression  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:56):**  of place.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:18:57):**  And so my philosophy is that we don't want the roots to acclimate themselves just to  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:01):**  the space under the drippers, because then it's only drawing expression of the property  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:08):**  from a very small percentage of the property.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:11):**  So we look at it from the standpoint that we're not managing the vines themselves, we're  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:15):**  managing the space in which the plant grows.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:18):**  And so deep root penetration is a critical piece.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:21):**  So about year three during the development of the vine, we'll go through with what we  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:28):**  call a hoe plow, or a French plow it's also called, and we remove the roots in the vine  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:35):**  row in order to get the plant to realize that they have to send roots down deeper.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:40):**  So we'll water significantly the first two, three, four years, and then year five we start  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:47):**  cutting the water back in half, and then in half again the next year, and the next year  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:50):**  by year 10, the plants are dry farmed on a hillside piece of property.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:19:56):**  I have this philosophy, I say farming grapes is kind of like raising a child.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:02):**  So each grape vine representing our children.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:06):**  So when we raise our kids, we have some opportunities to impact them to some degree.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:13):**  We can feed them well, we can nurture them when they're young, we can give them an opportunity  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:21):**  to go to good schools or to have good friends, to be able to choose whether they want to  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:28):**  do sports or music.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:30):**  But really the contribution that we provide for our kids is contributing to the space  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:35):**  in which they thrive and grow.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:39):**  And I say it's the same thing for a grape vine.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:41):**  We can contribute to the health and the viability of the soil and the space of the roots, but  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:47):**  also the space in which the plant itself grows.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:52):**  And our greatest hope for our kids, as is our vines, that they'll grow up and fully  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:20:57):**  developed and be fully expressed.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:01):**  One thing I was going to ask about was when he talked about having permanent cover, I  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:06):**  wasn't 100% sure what that meant in practice.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:08):**  So I guess maybe if you can talk a bit about that.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:12):**  Well, many vineyards you'll go and you'll see the vines in rows and then all the ground  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:16):**  below is completely dirt or just dirt.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:21):**  And obviously that's not great for soil.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:23):**  So a lot of vineyards in California put cover crops in between.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:28):**  But still, because they're worried about water, their narrative is to then till in that cover  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:36):**  crop.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:37):**  And so again, you get bare soil at certain times of the year when they want to reduce  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:40):**  or they think that it will allow more water to go to the vines.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:45):**  For him, it means that all year round he's leaving that cover crop in the ground.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:51):**  So it's like green below the vines all year round.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:21:54):**  And it was so interesting to see that he had seen no difference in terms of water use.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:00):**  And that's much more in line with all of the kind of science coming through from other  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:04):**  parts of the farming world.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:08):**  Was there anything he said that you're curious to try out on your family's vineyard?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:13):**  Well, we actually, we leave permanent cover all the time.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:18):**  So we definitely do that already.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:21):**  I really like, you have, it's so beautiful, his vineyard.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:26):**  When you're up on the top of the hillside, you can see out over the Mendocino Valley.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:30):**  And then he has these Cypress trees and lavender all along the ridge.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:34):**  And it just, you feel like you're in another land.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:38):**  So that was what I was most inspired by is adding some of this colorful beauty all within  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:22:45):**  the vineyard.

**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:23:00):**  Last month, they hosted the very intriguing sounding BioBlitz Festival.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:23:05):**  Johnny tells us about the festival and also speaks to Grow Wild Manager, Stephanie Bain,

**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:24):**  So Stephanie, who are Grow Wild and why work with local communities on nature conservation?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:32):**  Grow Wild is a project that is the outreach program of the Royal Botanic Gardens queue.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:38):**  And the Royal Botanic Gardens has a mission to make everybody understand plants and fungi  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:45):**  better.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:46):**  So Grow Wild works with communities who are not necessarily have any involvement with  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:52):**  nature or with growing or with any plant and encourage them to start bringing that connection  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:24:58):**  to nature together, particularly with native species and with local provenance species  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:05):**  to understand that bringing in tropical species and decorative species is not always the best  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:12):**  thing for a native wildlife.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:15):**  So the communities I work with can be very urban and some can be very rural.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:20):**  And they don't tend to apply to us for wild projects.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:24):**  They tend to apply to us because they see it as a nice pot of money, which is easy to  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:28):**  get.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:29):**  And then I make them think about native species of plants.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:32):**  And that brings us into animals and the wider nature around us.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:37):**  It's all about taking notice and having some fun.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:40):**  Stephanie, particularly in places like the UK and Ireland, farm landscapes are really  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:44):**  important for wild nature.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:46):**  So zooming out from the micro level with local communities to think about the landscape level,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:50):**  how do we maintain and in some cases restore biodiversity to those landscapes, especially  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:25:58):**  where farming is concerned?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:00):**  The one thing I would say is that our landscapes are all managed.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:03):**  There's nothing truly wild about Northern Ireland and in fact, the island of Ireland.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:09):**  So what we have to do is look at how our management practices can help biodiversity and the wild  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:16):**  species of our land.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:20):**  So things that we consider wild, wild flowers, maybe the Irish hare, maybe the wolf, if it  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:28):**  ever gets reintroduced, that'd be quite great.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:32):**  The whole point is that we manage the land around the possibility that they do come back  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:36):**  and they do have something, a habitat and a range to live in.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:41):**  So it's not so much about stopping farming.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:45):**  If we stop farming completely, we would lose our landscape.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:49):**  But it's about sympathetic farming and actually looking at farming management practices in  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:55):**  a way that can encourage species to thrive.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:26:58):**  So I suppose whether it's at the micro level or the macro, whether it's at the local or  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:04):**  the landscape, it's all about reconnecting people with where they live.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:10):**  It's all about reconnecting people with farm landscapes and the role of good farming management  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:15):**  in the conservation of wild nature.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:18):**  And I suppose from our perspective at Jubilee with our Free Range Families project, it's  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:22):**  getting people out of the classroom and out of their house and down onto the farm and  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:27):**  engaging with the world around them.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:29):**  When we do look at sympathetic land management, it actually makes the land more sustainable  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:35):**  and the people within it more sustainable by bringing not only those connections that  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:39):**  you're talking about, but actually bringing a more sustainable farmed landscape that will  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:44):**  last us many more years into the future.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:47):**  At the moment we're just taking.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:48):**  We need to just give it back as much as possible.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:51):**  Moving from that industrial and extractive model of agriculture to one that's restorative  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:27:57):**  and agroecological.

**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/36-wondrous-worms-cow-pats-biodynamic-vines-and-free-range-families#t=0:28:03):**  have wild nature flourishing in all our landscapes.

## 'Cereal', Episode 2: Nature hates uniformity  
**[0:00:00-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Serial, from Farmerama.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:26):**  This is episode 2, Nature Hates Uniformity.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:40):**  Bellhaven Community Garden, just outside my hometown of Dunbar, on the east coast of Scotland.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:46):**  One sunny spring day, volunteers are sowing a tiny plot of wheat.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:52):**  It's part of an initiative from Scotland the Bread, called Soil to Slice.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:00:57):**  The goal is to engage communities in cereal production, bringing the fields literally  
**[0:01:01-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:01):**  to their doorsteps.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:02):**  But it's also part of ongoing research into how different wheat varieties fare in different  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:08):**  parts of the country.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:10):**  It's one of the ways people across the UK are seeking to answer the question, in the  
**[0:01:16-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:16):**  face of climate and health crises, what seeds should we be sowing?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:25):**  In the last episode, we explored how, over the last century or so, our bread has changed  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:30):**  beyond recognition.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:32):**  Well, it's a change that ripples up and down the production chain.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:37):**  The industrial food system strives to maximise output while minimising human input, and that  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:43):**  requires scalable, uniform processes.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:47):**  Uniform processes that require uniform ingredients.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:53):**  Just as our bread has changed, so have our seeds.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:01:56):**  The seeds that grow into the plants, that yield the grain that's ground into the flour,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:01):**  that makes the bread.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:02):**  Our seeds have been transformed as well.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:05):**  But as with our bread, it wasn't a sudden change.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:09):**  It was a series of incremental steps, each of which had its own logic.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:14):**  Today, wheat covers an estimated 218 million hectares of the planet, more than any other  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:22):**  food crop.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:23):**  World trade in wheat outstrips that of all other crops combined.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:28):**  So how did we get to this point?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:30):**  Around 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers in the Middle East collected and ate the seeds  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:35):**  of wild grasses, wild wheats.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:39):**  At some point, they sowed a few of those seeds.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:41):**  They planted fields and tended them, and harvested the grain.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:46):**  There's debate around the question of whether farming enabled nomadic people to settle,  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:50):**  or whether they had to settle in order to tend and protect the fields they planted.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:02:55):**  In other words, as Ali Ragosa asks in her book, Restoring Heritage Grains, did people  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:01):**  domesticate wheat, or did wheat domesticate people?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:05):**  Either way, the domestication of wheat sparked the birth of agriculture.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:09):**  The earliest cultivated forms were what we now call einkorn and emmer.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:14):**  The sickle-shaped region in the Middle East, where wheat was first domesticated and agriculture  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:19):**  emerged, is now known as the Fertile Crescent.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:23):**  After about 8,000 BC, domesticated wheat spread from the Fertile Crescent.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:28):**  By 3000 BC, it had reached the British Isles.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:32):**  Those early wheat fields contained a huge amount of genetic diversity.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:37):**  Each plant would have been slightly different from the others.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:40):**  They were what we now refer to as populations.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:43):**  So population is a mixture of a number of varieties.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:46):**  Rupert Dunn from Torth Uthyr Peasant Bakery in South West Wales.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:51):**  So every year, you'll get cross-pollination when the wheat's flowering.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:54):**  It's a very special time in the field.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:03:56):**  3 to 5% of those varieties, as I understand it, will cross-pollinate.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:00):**  So every year, we'll have a new variety emerging in the field.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:04):**  As people sowed, tended and harvested in their local areas, year after year after year, those  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:10):**  wheat populations diverged from each other.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:14):**  Plants that were suited to the area's climate, soil and landscape, and maybe also to the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:18):**  local tastes and cuisines, thrived and reproduced.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:23):**  Others died out.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:24):**  The genetic makeup of populations in different places became distinct.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:29):**  So there's a historical, a cultural tradition to this local population.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:33):**  John Latz, a farmer and seed breeder based near Oxford.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:37):**  And over the years, those lines within it that are better adapted are going to produce  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:43):**  more seed, just natural selection and evolution.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:45):**  So those that were better adapted to the soil, to the weather, to the climate, to the way  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:49):**  they were harvested, to factors that we can't even dream about ecologically because it's  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:54):**  so complicated, they've adapted to the local area.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:57):**  So they're growing these and saving the seed every year.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:04:59):**  So they're perpetuating that genetic diversity from year to year.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:02):**  So you can call it a population, but because it's been grown in one area for a long time,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:06):**  it's a land race, quite unique to that area.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:09):**  Might have a unique flavour, might have a unique colour, makes unique bread, beer, whatever.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:13):**  It's local.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:15):**  So for millennia, we grew land races, locally adapted, genetically diverse populations of  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:21):**  cereal plants.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:23):**  Then in the 19th century.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:25):**  So someone comes into the field in the 1830s and he says, oh, your crop is very messy.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:30):**  It's hundreds of different varieties in this field.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:32):**  And what you really want is uniformity.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:34):**  And it started in about 1830s in a big way by a guy named Jean LeCoultre, a guy from  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:39):**  Jersey.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:41):**  So what happened over the next 30, 40 years as a scientist with a genuine desire to improve  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:45):**  those crops would go in and they'd select maybe two or three ears out of this field  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:49):**  of 500, take those away.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:52):**  And all that genetic diversity in that field was then milled up into the last loaf.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:05:57):**  Perhaps even 2000 years of genetic history and evolution was lost.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:02):**  And the three years they'd select were pulled out and purified and they would maybe grow  
**[0:06:06-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:06):**  one ear each year, take the best ear out of each plant and so on until you have pure varieties.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:14):**  And there was a big sea chain shift in that, I think in the early 1900s when they started  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:21):**  to hybridize wheat.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:24):**  People played with hybridization 50 years before, but they never produced any real commercial  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:28):**  varieties from that.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:30):**  So they were pure line selections.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:32):**  In 1906, 1908, they released the first two commercially successful hybrid wheats, Little  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:37):**  Joss and Victor.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:40):**  And that was to improve baking quality because the bakers wanted high gluten.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:44):**  And so they crossed in wheats like Red Phife and all these really high gluten North American  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:48):**  ones.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:49):**  A hybrid is created when two different varieties of a plant are deliberately cross pollinated.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:06:54):**  It means you can select specific characteristics or traits from different varieties and concentrate  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:00):**  them in a new variety.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:02):**  Those traits might be things like gluten content, disease resistance, height or yield.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:07):**  And although people did experiment with hybridization in the 19th century, it really accelerated  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:13):**  in the 1960s during the so-called Green Revolution, a period of rapid and momentous global change  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:20):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:21):**  And then through intensive selection, one ear, one plant, one ear, one plant, one ear,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:26):**  one plant for seven or eight generations, you get rid of as much genetic diversity as  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:30):**  possible and you end up with that monocultural modern hybrid wheat.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:35):**  Modern wheat.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:36):**  One of the key figures in its development was an American agronomist named Norman Borlaug,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:42):**  also known as the father of the Green Revolution.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:45):**  He was passionate about relieving hunger around the world and he believed the way to do that  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:51):**  was to make farming more intensive.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:54):**  The idea was that if farms moved away from growing lots of different crops and instead  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:07:58):**  got really good at growing a single crop, that would improve their efficiency and increase  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:03):**  their yields.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:05):**  Borlaug and his team crossed thousands of wheats from around the world to develop a  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:09):**  hybrid variety that was high yielding and apparently disease resistant.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:14):**  It was specifically bred to respond to the synthetic nitrogen-based fertilizers that  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:19):**  had recently become available, and that meant it could be grown in areas that weren't naturally  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:24):**  suited to it.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:25):**  But heavy use of nitrogen-based fertilizer increases the chance of lodging, which is  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:30):**  when plants topple over in the wind or rain and rot, meaning their grain goes to waste.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:36):**  Also Borlaug's wheat had dwarfing genes which gave it a much shorter, thicker stem and reduced  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:42):**  the risk of lodging.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:43):**  For comparison, before the Green Revolution wheat grew to around 4 feet or even taller.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:50):**  Modern varieties stand at around 2 feet tall.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:08:54):**  That also means the plant puts more of its energy into producing grain instead of stock.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:00):**  So under the right conditions, modern wheat varieties are very high yielding and they're  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:06):**  uniform, a genetic monoculture.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:08):**  So those modern varieties are the result of really you could say at least 150 years of  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:15):**  intensive genetic selection to get rid of diversity so that every plant in the field  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:21):**  is genetically identical, genetically pure.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:25):**  Now there might be a little touch of genetic diversity in there because nature has its  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:31):**  way of hiding a bit of diversity from us, but in almost every significant visual, kind  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:37):**  of morphological genetic trait, they are uniform.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:41):**  They are clones of each other.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:44):**  Identical plants have advantages.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:46):**  In some ways, they're easier to manage and easier to harvest.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:49):**  They're the same height.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:51):**  Their grain ripens at the same time.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:54):**  They fit more easily into a mechanized farm system.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:09:57):**  And if you're selling into a commodity market that requires uniformity, their grain is suited  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:02):**  to that.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:03):**  But...  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:04):**  Because every plant in the field is identical, they're genetically uniform.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:07):**  Nature hates uniformity.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:09):**  Disease comes in, a pest comes in, boom.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:10):**  You lose the whole, you know, the rust sweeps through the field.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:13):**  You can almost see it moving through the field day by day.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:17):**  Identical plants have identical vulnerabilities and they have identical needs.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:22):**  They compete for the same resources at the same times.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:25):**  And if you're trying to squeeze plants together which are identical, which are occupying exactly  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:31):**  the same niche, then you have to have large amounts of inputs in order to make it work.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:38):**  That's the late Professor Martin Wolf speaking at the Oxford Real Farming Conference back  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:43):**  in 2011.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:44):**  You've got to have lots of nutrients available, added into the system.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:49):**  You've got to have pest disease, weed control in place.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:53):**  And in many cases, you have to have water as well.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:10:57):**  And these, these additions, these inputs are totally dependent on a stable environment,  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:04):**  resources being available and of course, cheap energy.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:07):**  A stable environment, available resources, cheap energy.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:13):**  Is this ringing alarm bells?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:15):**  I've heard several analogies for modern wheat varieties.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:18):**  I've heard them described as addicts, dependent on getting their fix, or as being on life  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:23):**  support hooked up to an intravenous drip, or as being attached by an umbilical cord  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:29):**  to petrochemical inputs.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:31):**  All of these analogies make the same point.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:34):**  Yes, in ideal conditions, with the right synthetic fertilizers and the right doses at the right  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:40):**  times, the right mix of herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, the right weather, the right  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:45):**  temperatures, in those conditions, modern varieties do fine.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:50):**  They yield really well.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:54):**  But without those ideal conditions, they're extremely vulnerable.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:11:59):**  They can't look after themselves.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:03):**  As we adapt to climate change, can we afford to rely on that artificial life support system?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:14):**  Those modern varieties, the modern hybrids, dwarfs, they were bred to respond to nitrogen.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:20):**  They need high nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:23):**  They've been selected to be short so that all that energy they capture from the sun  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:27):**  goes into grain, not into straw.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:30):**  But that means they've also stunted the root system.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:33):**  And that's because that's where you put your fertilizer.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:34):**  So why should they develop deep root systems?  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:36):**  It's a waste of plants' energy.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:38):**  They're so short, they can't compete against weeds, so they need herbicides.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:42):**  And they're also not very good at forming these connections with root fungi, mycorrhiza.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:46):**  So they don't work in sustainable systems, in low input systems with no nitrogen.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:50):**  Those modern varieties cannot be grown in that sustainable way.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:12:55):**  So if modern wheat is incompatible with sustainable farming, what's the alternative?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:00):**  John Letts and many others say it's about reviving older wheats, so-called heritage  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:06):**  varieties.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:07):**  There's no scientific definition of a heritage variety, but the term is generally applied  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:12):**  to varieties that existed before the 1950s or 60s, before the so-called Green Revolution.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:19):**  One of the things these varieties have in common is their broad genetic base.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:23):**  It's a sliding scale, but heritage means diversity to me.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:28):**  It has genetic diversity in it still.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:32):**  And they also share certain characteristics.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:34):**  These crops are not only dealing with bad weather from year to year, so they need to  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:38):**  be resilient, but they're dealing with longer-term climate change.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:42):**  And what's fantastic about these old heritage varieties is that they have massively deep  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:45):**  root systems.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:46):**  So they can deal with drought, they can deal with low fertility, I think they can even  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:51):**  pass nutrients between them.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:55):**  They work as a community.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:57):**  And if we want sustainable farming, that's what we need.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:13:59):**  We need to create a sustainable, resilient, true agroecological ecosystem.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:07):**  So now, all over the country, people are researching and reviving heritage varieties, sowing them  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:14):**  out in different places, observing, sharing results, harvesting, milling, testing, tasting,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:21):**  and sowing out again.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:22):**  Scotland the Bread is one of many groups who've been doing this for several years.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:26):**  So we've found grains which were purely as a starting point.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:31):**  This isn't a heritage museum project.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:33):**  Andrew Whitley, co-founder of the Real Bread campaign and Scotland the Bread.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:38):**  But we found wheat varieties with Scottish names languishing in gene banks around the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:44):**  world from as far apart as the United States and Poland and Russia.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:48):**  We got them together, grew them in an experimental plot and had them tested and found that the  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:54):**  ones that had the same name were essentially the same genetic, so we put them all together.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:14:59):**  The three varieties were Rouge de Cosse, Golden Drop and Hunters.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:04):**  To find them, Andy Forbes of the Brockwell Bake Project in London scoured gene banks  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:09):**  around the world, searching for varieties that could have Scottish provenance.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:14):**  He managed to get hold of 13 small samples of seed.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:18):**  They were germinated and planted out on four farms across Scotland.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:22):**  Each year after that, the grain was harvested and re-sown.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:26):**  Those three varieties are now being grown, milled and sold as flour by Scotland the Bread.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:32):**  Significantly, we also found that on average they had a very interesting nutritional profile.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:38):**  It was uneven as it was bound to be because there's lots of perverse effects with soils  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:43):**  and climate and all the rest of it.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:45):**  But generally, compared to a control, they had more minerals, key minerals that are important  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:49):**  for human nutrition, which you might expect to be present in your bread if you actually  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:53):**  bother about these things, which we need to because some people in our population even  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:15:58):**  now don't get enough iron, zinc, magnesium in their diet in an assimilable, digestible  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:05):**  way.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:06):**  It can sound as though this is almost medicalised when we talk about individual minerals and  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:11):**  nutrients and bioavailability and so on, but it's also actually about really tasty, lovely  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:16):**  food that you want to eat.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:19):**  Scotland the Bread's research into heritage varieties is very much ongoing.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:23):**  The soil to slice plot that we heard about at the start of this episode is part of that  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:27):**  research.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:29):**  This year, at Belhaven Community Garden, volunteers were growing three Swedish heritage varieties  
**[0:16:34-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:34):**  – Ölands, Lögn and Dalarna.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:44):**  All over the country, and the world, other individuals and groups are also reviving heritage  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:50):**  wheat varieties with their diverse genetics.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:53):**  But true resilience requires diversity at all levels.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:16:58):**  So far, we've talked about diversity within a variety.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:03):**  Could the next step be to recreate populations, allowing varieties to cross-pollinate with  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:08):**  each other, abandoning the idea of a specific variety altogether?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:14):**  Going back to the within-crop diversity, what we've been trying to do in this particular  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:20):**  project which we started at the beginning of the decade is to develop wheat populations  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:26):**  in which every plant is different from every other in the crop.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:31):**  These crops, as they develop, as they evolve under their own steam, so to say, gradually  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:38):**  become much more uniform, surprisingly uniform in appearance, but they still have within  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:46):**  them this immense capacity for variation, for the ability to complement each other,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:52):**  to deal with local differences in the environment.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:17:57):**  This is the way that we produce the populations initially.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:00):**  I won't go into the detail, but intercrossing a large number of high yielding and high quality  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:06):**  varieties to produce these populations, what we've been able to find and demonstrate from  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:13):**  looking at the performance of these populations, that in fact they do demonstrate real resilience  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:20):**  in variable environments.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:22):**  They are much better than the parents.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:26):**  High yielding varieties crossed with high quality varieties, the YQ population.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:33):**  It's also known as the ORC Wakelands population in reference to the Organic Research Centre  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:39):**  which pioneered its development and Wakelands Agroforestry, Martin Wolf's farm in Suffolk  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:45):**  where a lot of the work took place.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:48):**  Martin Wolf had a successful career as a plant pathologist before he became disillusioned  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:52):**  with mainstream approaches to disease control in crops.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:18:56):**  He bought Wakelands as a place to explore alternative models, approaches based on growing  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:01):**  different crops together, interspersing crops with trees and generally increasing diversity.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:08):**  YQ was one of the outcomes of that research.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:12):**  Kimberly Bell is the founder of Small Food Bakery in Nottingham.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:16):**  She was introduced to YQ and to Martin Wolf when she was researching ingredients for a  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:21):**  sustainably sourced meal.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:23):**  Her collaborator was a keen forager.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:25):**  But one of the things he said to me which is very provocative was that I can't make  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:29):**  a bread for this meal.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:30):**  He said wheat bread is never going to be a sustainable food.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:35):**  So he forced me to look for the most sustainable bread wheat that I could find which took me  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:41):**  to Wakelands Agroforestry.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:42):**  And initially I went there because I'd heard that they were growing wheat amongst trees  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:47):**  and I thought well John's problem with the wheat is that it's typically grown as a monoculture  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:52):**  often in you know quite chemical farming systems.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:57):**  And so I thought he'll be happy with that.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:19:58):**  If I can say I'm going to get a wheat from an agroforestry system he'll let me have  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:01):**  bread on the menu basically.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:03):**  We went to visit Martin, Laura and I.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:05):**  We drove all the way to Suffolk.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:06):**  We spent a day with him.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:08):**  We weren't expecting the welcome that we got.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:11):**  We thought we'd probably just be like a little bit of a pain in the bum.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:14):**  We knew he was a little bit famous and like he probably got lots of visitors.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:17):**  But when we got there he just said something like I'm so glad you're here.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:21):**  And we were like oh really.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:23):**  And he just basically explained that he'd been developing this population wheat for  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:27):**  many many years, 17 or 18 years of field trials.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:33):**  And he'd been trying to convince bakers to work with it and no one had sort of taken  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:37):**  the bait so far.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:39):**  And so I know Martin had a way of getting people to do things without you really realizing  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:44):**  that you were going to do it.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:45):**  But I think somehow that day we realized we were going to become ambassadors for that  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:49):**  wheat and we were going to figure out how to bake it.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:52):**  They're a noisy bunch aren't they?  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:54):**  Yeah we can go somewhere else.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:20:58):**  That's great.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:01):**  What Martin explained to us that day when we visited was really a kind of brief overview  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:06):**  of plant breeding.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:08):**  And typically crops are bred to serve particular functions within a particular agricultural  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:14):**  system.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:15):**  So we've kind of come to this situation where crops are bred for a marketplace instead  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:20):**  of bred for the ecology that they need to exist within.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:24):**  To me it's just a bit forced and I guess what John was trying to say, my collaborator  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:28):**  in putting together this meal, was very much that we need to work much more with nature  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:33):**  and that a vast wheat monocrop was not a natural phenomena.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:39):**  So coming to speak to Martin with that in the back of my mind when he presented the  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:42):**  population he described it as a genetically diverse population of wheat and then later  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:49):**  explained the technicalities of that which, how he came to achieve that was to crossbreed  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:55):**  20 different varieties every which way.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:21:57):**  So the DNA from every plant was married with every plant and what that did was create 200  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:04):**  parent plants that he then grew up and planted out in a field.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:09):**  The principle was simply that by having a much broader library of DNA the crop rather  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:16):**  than plant would be able to respond to any challenges that it faced while growing and  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:22):**  those challenges could be pathogens, they could be climate related.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:26):**  But essentially what Martin hypothesised was that the plants would have enough of a library  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:34):**  of tools to be able to cope with any situation that it was put into and the population wheat  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:40):**  was never intended to be a high yielding wheat, it was just intended to be something that  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:45):**  was reliable so that a farmer could not have a crop that failed.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:51):**  And I asked him a question which for me illustrates quite well what the population is.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:22:56):**  If you planted a field of population wheat how big does it need to be before you get  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:01):**  a replication?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:02):**  So I was interested in the maths of this kind of like population and he said he thought  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:08):**  that if you had two acres of the population you would not find two genetically identical  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:13):**  plants and I think that's a really good way of visualising the sorts of diversity that  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:17):**  we're talking about.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:18):**  So yeah it's been pretty exciting to be an ambassador for that crop over the last couple  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:24):**  of years and a real privilege to spend time with Martin.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:29):**  Mark Lee has an organic mixed farm in Shropshire.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:32):**  Along with a wide range of heritage varieties he's been growing YQ for several years.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:38):**  Martin Wolff introduced the idea that YQ as a population because of its genetic diversity  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:44):**  would adapt in real time really, year to year.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:49):**  Not in terms of evolution but it would adapt and change the frequency of different genetics  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:23:54):**  within it so the most successful elements of it would succeed dependent on the environment  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:00):**  that they're in.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:01):**  And it was really that visualisation of evolution but in one crop that was actually happening  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:07):**  right in front of us that if we grew a crop here in Shropshire rather than in Norfolk  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:11):**  or Suffolk it would adapt to Shropshire weather, Shropshire conditions.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:17):**  The belief there is that if it's continually exposed to those environmental conditions  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:21):**  that the frequency of genetics will adapt it would potentially become better, certainly  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:27):**  more resilient, may not perform better but it may perform more reliably which again is  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:32):**  the principle of it really.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:34):**  And instead of buying in new seed every year the whole logic of populations like YQ is  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:40):**  that farmers can save and sow their own seed.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:43):**  We're into fourth year with the same YQ seed and have absolutely no ambition to have new  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:47):**  seed that's the point.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:49):**  We always will grow the same and keep growing the same.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:24:55):**  Professor Martin Wolff passed away in the spring of 2019 but it's clear that his legacy  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:01):**  is alive and well, quite literally in the fields and figuratively in the hearts and  
**[0:25:07-0:25:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:07):**  minds of the people who knew him, worked with him and learnt from him.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:16):**  One thing to note, YQ was created by crossing 19 modern wheat varieties plus one slightly  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:23):**  older variety, Maris Widgeon.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:25):**  Their parents were genetically uniform so there wasn't a huge amount of diversity there  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:30):**  but what was there shuffled around.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:34):**  He was building in as much diversity as possible within a modern variety because what he wanted  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:40):**  to retain was the short straw, the dwarfing genes.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:45):**  I would rather have seen a composite cross population incorporating old heritage lines  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:51):**  because of the deeper root systems, the taller straw.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:25:54):**  I think there's some other factors that now, having spoken to Martin just before, that's  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:00):**  where I think we were all moving.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:02):**  So what we did was I was growing the old populations, he was growing the modern ones, the YQ, and  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:06):**  we mixed them together to have the old time population.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:09):**  So it covers modern increased diversity as well as ancient diversity.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:15):**  It's the same concept in diversity as strength, whether it's modern or not.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:18):**  So I think the modern varieties were selected a lot for yield and maybe less so for flavour  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:25):**  and resilience but in a higher nitrogen environment YQ would do well because that's where it's  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:30):**  parents are.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:32):**  But if you mix the two then you have heritage lines that have flavour and texture and resilience  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:36):**  from the past so it kind of makes sense.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:38):**  But in a low input system I still think those modern varieties that are adapted to high  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:42):**  nitrogen fundamentally will gradually disappear.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:47):**  But what he showed was that the key to stability of yield and stability of quality of resilience  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:53):**  was diversity.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:54):**  It's what our ancestors did naturally.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:26:56):**  So I think the YQ is a fantastic part of the story going forward.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:01):**  It was blazing a trail in many ways because it also was allowed to be marketed in the  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:05):**  EU.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:06):**  So for many reasons that was fantastic research that we have to take forward.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:10):**  Yes, there's a very important factor that we haven't yet talked about, regulation.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:17):**  Well the current seed system in order to market, in order to sell, trade, barter, give away  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:24):**  seed of any crop it has to have passed the tests to be licensed by DEFRA.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:30):**  So it has to be genetically distinct from anything else, genetically uniform, genetically  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:34):**  stable.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:35):**  In the UK if you want to sell seed that variety has got to be registered on the national list.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:42):**  The list is intended as a quality control, a guarantee for farmers that the seed they're  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:47):**  buying is reliable, that it's been tested and approved, that it won't result in a failed  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:52):**  harvest.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:54):**  Varieties that make it onto the list are then included in an EU database so they can be  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:27:58):**  marketed across Europe.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:00):**  To be approved for inclusion on the national list a variety must be distinct, uniform and  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:06):**  stable.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:07):**  Distinct meaning it has different characteristics to other varieties.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:12):**  Uniform meaning all the plants within the variety share those same characteristics.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:17):**  Stable meaning the variety remains unchanged even after several generations.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:23):**  In other words the offspring are the same as the parents and the parents' parents and  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:28):**  so on.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:29):**  Well by definition having a population of any kind means it's not genetically uniform  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:34):**  and not genetically stable.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:35):**  I don't want stability, I want genetically unstable because that's how it adapts, that's  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:40):**  what nature does.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:41):**  So there's no way I can market this.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:44):**  What was great about Martin Wolf's work is that he did get a special dispensation for  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:49):**  the YQ population to be marketed but for a specific amount of time.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:28:54):**  In 2014 the Organic Research Centre persuaded EU officials to grant a derogation, a sort  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:00):**  of temporary relaxation of the law.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:03):**  That change allowed seed that doesn't fit the normal rules to be marketed, seed like  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:08):**  the YQ population.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:10):**  So could that derogation pave the way for a permanent change in the law?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:15):**  Here's Josiah Meldrum from Hodmadods, a company that sources and supplies sustainably grown  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:20):**  pulses and grains from British farms.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:23):**  The amazing thing about the population was that they needed to demonstrate that it could  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:27):**  be grown on farms which meant that the Organic Research Centre and Martin needed to be able  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:32):**  to trade the seed and in order to do that they needed to get a derogation from the European  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:36):**  Union to allow them to trade a non-listed seed.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:40):**  Having done that they set something of a precedent, it's clearly possible, the EU were quite supportive  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:45):**  of the whole process and it's meant that the new organic standard that's being adopted  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:48):**  all across Europe at the moment contains a clause which allows for the sale and exchange  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:53):**  and trade of heterogeneous, unlisted varieties.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:29:59):**  It's only organic but the challenge there from a policing point of view is how do you  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:04):**  know how someone's going to grow it once they've bought the seed?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:08):**  And I think that it represents a kind of breakdown of that hegemony of the big scale seed companies  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:17):**  who won't have, we shouldn't say this really, they won't have twigged that this is happening  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:21):**  I suspect, they won't even know that it's written because it's not on their radar and  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:27):**  it will free up and allow a lot of the kind of networks of exchange that we need to happen  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:31):**  to facilitate the creation of this new relocalised grain economies that will want these varieties.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:37):**  I think that's a big thing so I'm hoping that perhaps Martin's biggest legacy will  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:42):**  be the fact that the research work that he was involved with caused this change to have  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:47):**  to happen.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:48):**  Is that an opening now that I can drive through the heritage grain sector?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:52):**  We should because in a sense the EU and countries around the world are trying to preserve crop  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:30:58):**  genetic diversity and biodiversity and on the left hand they're making it illegal to  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:02):**  do that by having strict seed legislation.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:06):**  Makes no sense.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:07):**  At the time of recording we don't yet know for certain whether a post-Brexit UK will  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:12):**  adopt these same provisions.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:14):**  But even before the EU derogation some breeders of diverse seed already had inventive ways  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:20):**  of doing their work.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:22):**  My plan and quite strategic decision about 10-15 years ago was I'm going to create a  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:29):**  genetically diverse population that's illegal, I can't give it to anybody, but I'm going  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:33):**  to make it so popular and spread it around so far that by the time they figure out that  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:38):**  I'm doing this and try to stop me you won't be able to put the rabbit back in the hat.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:43):**  They did call me up to Cambridge, I won't go into detail, but they basically told me  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:46):**  I had to stop what I was doing.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:48):**  And I said I'm not doing anything illegal because I'm growing it.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:53):**  And they're saying well you can't grow this diversity and I said yes I can, I just can't  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:56):**  sell it or give it to anyone else.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:31:58):**  Anyway I didn't let them stop me.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:00):**  So if they ever do try to stop me, which it would be insane to do it now because we're  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:05):**  clearly in a different period where we have to increase this diversity and they're beginning  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:09):**  to recognize it.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:10):**  But I thought well then I'll take them to the WTO for stopping a viable economic activity.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:15):**  I had a whole bunch of different plans for doing it.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:17):**  Basically I wanted to provoke them because it's quite clear that we have to move towards  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:21):**  more sustainable farming systems.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:22):**  And the basis for that I think fundamentally you've got to start with genetic diversity  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:27):**  in your crops.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:28):**  If you don't have that you're going to struggle to have any sort of sustainable true agroecological  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:33):**  system.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:34):**  I think you need good quality seed.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:36):**  I planted a five acre field and not a seed came up because it was old.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:40):**  I know what that's like.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:41):**  So I'm not against good quality seed.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:43):**  I'm not against being careful about that.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:45):**  Some of the lessons might be useful, but it's actively discouraging the preservation and  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:49):**  use of genetic diversity in order to create varieties that are profitable so that big  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:32:54):**  companies, this is the theory, can reinvest their money into producing new varieties because  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:00):**  we need to create these new varieties that are adapted to climate change.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:03):**  Well no, the way to adapt to climate change is diversity.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:06):**  It's not to stop diversity and then pay a big plant breeding company billions to produce  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:11):**  new varieties every year.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:12):**  We're never going to outbreed the rate of climate change.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:16):**  It's coming too quickly.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:17):**  These diseases are evolving quickly.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:19):**  The only hope we have is to have an inbuilt resistance through genetic diversity.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:24):**  So that's what we should be encouraging, not trying to stop it.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:27):**  So if the legislation or the dominant system continues to favour the status quo, distinct,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:34):**  uniform and stable seeds with progress understood as the constant development of new varieties,  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:40):**  which is an undertaking that requires huge levels of financial investment, if that remains  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:45):**  the case, could one alternative be a more collaborative model?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:49):**  What we need is populations that are out there that are available for everyone.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:53):**  Well how do we do that with the legislation?  
**[0:33:55-0:34:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:33:55):**  So what we do is we get everyone to come together and we together create a people's population.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:02):**  So there's no exchange then, is there?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:04):**  We've all together co-bred, co-created, you know, participative plant breeding.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:10):**  We've created a population so no one can say that we've been swapping it around.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:15):**  And part of that creation would be growing the, let's call it the mother, the proto population  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:21):**  in different parts of the country.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:23):**  So it's then adapting to those local conditions.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:25):**  And we keep bringing that seed back to a central place and growing some of it there.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:29):**  But together we all create a very, very, very mixed population, the mother of all populations.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:37):**  Then when that's ready, well the people who are already part of the Populations Project  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:41):**  can grow it and there's no exchange required.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:42):**  And they can then supply their local millers and their local bakers and we're on our way  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:47):**  back to recreating local grain economies.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:50):**  We could do that.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:51):**  It would take about five years.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:52):**  It wouldn't take massive amounts of funding, but it would take a bit of a home-based gene  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:57):**  bank.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:34:58):**  So we can recreate this if we all work together and we better do it soon because we need this  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:01):**  to happen within five or ten years given the state of the climate.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:05):**  There are a lot of people very interested in this all over the country.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:07):**  There are quite a few groups in Wales moving.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:10):**  There's work going on in Scotland.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:12):**  So if we all work together, I think we can in a sense circumvent this legislation that  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:17):**  stops the spread.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:18):**  But it's also got to be done quite, I think, carefully.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:22):**  One there's no disease, which can happen in grain, but there are easy ways of treating  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:25):**  that.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:26):**  So we need to be clever and maximize the diversity.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:29):**  Maybe it would mean including some YQ into it, but having the most genetically diverse  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:33):**  population we could possibly create, farming it out to the areas, bringing it back and  
**[0:35:38-0:35:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:38):**  all working together to recreate what our ancestors did naturally.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:47):**  The current seed system is not some evil conspiracy.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:52):**  It does have, or it did have, a logical basis.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:35:56):**  It's supposed to protect farmers, to give them confidence in the seeds they're buying.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:01):**  And the royalty system associated with it is meant to support innovation, to make sure  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:05):**  that breeders are rewarded for their work, that it isn't stolen, and that they can invest  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:10):**  resources back into breeding the next new variety.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:15):**  But that logic is outdated at the very least.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:18):**  It's clear that the current approach is no longer fit for purpose.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:24):**  If there's just one conclusion we'd like you to take away from this episode, it's that  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:29):**  any vision we have of a sustainable, resilient, healthy future has to be underpinned by diversity.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:37):**  Whether that's in the genetics of our cereals, in the life present in the field and on the  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:42):**  farm, or crucially, in the range of people who control access to the seeds we rely on  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:48):**  to feed ourselves.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:51):**  And whereas the current legislation and the mainstream model of seed breeding concentrates  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:36:56):**  power in the hands of a few large companies, heritage varieties and populations instead  
**[0:37:02-0:37:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:02):**  disperse that power to the hands of farmers, activists, bakers, and in fact, all of us.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:10):**  Diversity, autonomy, resilience.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:15):**  We'll return to these interconnected themes in the next episode when we'll be meeting  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:19):**  cereal farmers.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:22):**  For now, here's Professor Martin Wolf again to sum things up with a quote from a certain  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:28):**  Mr Charles Darwin.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:29):**  I'll leave the last word to the man that started it all.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:34):**  I use this quite often.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:35):**  I just love the wording.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:38):**  So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:43):**  plants are diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity#t=0:37:49):**  be capable of their supporting themselves.

**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:04):**  आलेक्सांजर सेक्स्टिन्ड  
**[0:02:06-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:06):**  SAAAAAA would be my biggest take-out is...me, Hope, which is quite nice, to start the year...  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:34):**  We are doing market garden at Village Farm.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:37):**  My take away from here has been a lot of talk about soil science which is amazing.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:42):**  I am really pleased that it is getting into more of what I now consider mainstream farming because we are organic mainstream.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  It is amazing to see how many different ways there are to fix the soil and nice to see lots of people doing them.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  My name is Howell Lewis. I am a beef farmer and forester in West Yorkshire.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:03):**  My biggest take away from the conference is being very inspired by other farmers telling their stories of how they are making their farms work in a sustainable and viable way.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:15):**  Hi, I am Rebecca aka the Wild Shepherd from Village Farm.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:20):**  It is my first year at Oxford. I have really enjoyed it. There needs to be more talks about sheep.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:25):**  But it is so lovely to meet the sustainable community.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:31):**  I have really loved how many no plough and soil carbon themes there are.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:38):**  My name is Rebecca.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:40):**  I am Peter Kindersley and we run the Sheep Drain Trust.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:46):**  It is just wonderful to see us now twice as big as the old farming conference down the road.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:56):**  It really is amazing.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:03:58):**  I think in fact we are probably more than twice as big.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  It is an amazing buzz here for anybody who comes and I really do encourage people to come because it really is looking into the future and what we can do to really help our farming system fit in with nature and supply really good quality food.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:21):**  Peter Lungren. I am a conventional arable farmer in Lincolnshire.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  The good thing with this event is the energy and enthusiasm for farming.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  When you meet Lincolnshire farmers they are very down. They have only got 2000 acres. They have only got one quad track.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:35):**  When you come here and you meet young people who are desperate to get into farming.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:39):**  I was talking to a young couple last night. They were milking seven goats. They have just got their first cow. They are living in a converted bus.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:47):**  They are desperate to get into farming. That level of energy and enthusiasm is what will take farming forward.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:53):**  Well obviously the big big debate this year is Brexit.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:04:57):**  That is one of the big things that is being discussed a lot here.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:05:03):**  The other is of course the nutritional differences between organic and conventional food.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:05:10):**  There is no doubt that the research is really coming home to say that organic is better.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:05:40):**  Applause  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:05:54):**  Abby is not here today in person. She is back on her family's farm in Chile.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:05:59):**  Nevertheless here she is with some thoughts from the conference she sent over.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  It is a very precarious and sad time here in Chile right now.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:11):**  I am stuck inside as the smoke is too thick to go outside.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  There are over 100 fires burning as we speak and only a few of them are under control.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:19):**  The fire is literally less than a kilometre away right now and all I can see is smoke pouring over the hill where we live.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:26):**  It has been like this for over seven days now and more fires are started each day in new locations.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:32):**  It is chaos and camaraderie on the ground.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  As people are coming to help but the volunteer firemen are speeding around saving one person to the next.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:41):**  No one is even trying to save the forests any longer.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  We evacuated our farm a few days ago as a new fire was started in the pine forest in front and the flames licked towards us.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  We are all safe and for now our farm is okay too although a new fire is passing through as we speak.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:00):**  Living in a deserted blackened landscape it becomes ever clearer that we must work together combining farming, forestry and native lands to keep our earth a beautiful place.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:11):**  The natural world never stops reminding us that working with the land is a very risky business.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  Something I think the non-farming community don't always understand.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:21):**  Vast tracks of pine forest or tinderboxes that the natural world would never have created.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:27):**  Going forward I hope we learn.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:29):**  It's been hard to do anything other than track fires, prepare breaks and help others over the last week.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:35):**  So I hope my thoughts have some consistency this month.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:39):**  Back to the wonderful ORFC.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  The three main things I came away with were that one storytelling is key.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:47):**  We need to create an alternative narrative to tell a story that offers a different vision than the overarching we need GM to feed the world.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:56):**  Which has been paradigm for many years.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:07:59):**  Secondly the importance of combining modern tools and technology with older farming methods.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:05):**  Joel Salatin calls it new fashion farming where GM and chemical inputs are now old fashioned.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:12):**  And thirdly what an opportunity we have right now in the UK to rethink subsidies and farming policy post Brexit.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  One of the highlights of us at ORFC in 2016 was Rebecca Lawton and we were lucky enough to corner her for an interview this time.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:29):**  Rebecca is a long time organic market gardener in Dorset as well as campaigns researcher for Land Workers Alliance.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:36):**  She spent the last two years researching the productivity of small scale farms in the UK.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:41):**  She felt that in order to have the government take her seriously and think about how small scale farms might offer a very valuable contribution to agriculture.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:50):**  She needed to provide some real data.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:53):**  Anecdotal evidence was not enough and so the Master of Scale report came into being.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:08:59):**  So I'm Rebecca Lawton and I am a member of the Land Workers Alliance and I grow vegetables as a tenant farmer on a large organic farm in Dorset.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:12):**  As part of my role in the Land Workers Alliance I'm campaigns researcher.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:17):**  I started the a matter of scale project which I aimed to find out about how productive small scale farms are in relation to large scale farms.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:29):**  And to find out generally a bit more about the small scale farming sector in the UK.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:33):**  And I wanted to do this to actually find out whether claims that small farms are more productive than large farms were actually accurate.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:42):**  There are a lot of claims that are going about both ways.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  The government sees small farms as being hobby farms or at best niche farms producing luxury value added foods.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:09:55):**  Whereas a lot of small farmers are saying well actually we can provide significant amounts of foods to feed the UK population and we can be more productive than larger farms.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  So I really wanted to find out what the truth is whether small farms are more productive than large farms or whether they're not.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  And I managed to get about 70 respondents to the online surveys that we conducted which is actually a very very small sample when you consider that there are 98,000 farms of 20 hectares and less in the UK.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:10:31):**  The dominant enterprises were vegetable production followed by fruit production and poultry production.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:10:39):**  But vegetable production was by far in a way the most frequent enterprise.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:10:47):**  And really the only data set which I feel it's legitimate to draw many conclusions from is the vegetable data because the others are just too small and too patchy and too diverse to draw any conclusions from.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:11:06):**  There were some very very productive farms but then there were quite a lot that were below average in the data set.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  When you looked at the median and compared it to organic farms and then to standard organic data for non-organic farms, the medians actually compared quite well both with the standard organic data and with the non-organic data.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  Particularly for crops such as broad beans, salad and other leafy vegetables, the ones that require high labour input which is perhaps not that surprising but it was good to actually see the figures support the fact that small farms that are producing labour intensive vegetable crops can actually be highly productive.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:11:55):**  Other crops such as potatoes, onions, carrots and even things like squash didn't compare so well.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:12:03):**  The ones that use quite a lot of machinery and you don't need so much hand labour for.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:12:10):**  But they were about the same rather than a lot less.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:12:15):**  Potatoes and carrots and onions were actually lower but I think what the results point to is that there's a productivity advantage for small farms producing certain categories of produce.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:12:31):**  And as we're coming into an era where potentially we might have higher prices of fresh produce if it's being an import from Europe, I think there's potential to be really increasing domestic productivity of fresh produce using small farms at the same time as creating some really good employment for young people on farms.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:13:01):**  There were various examples when I asked people about what their barriers to productivity were of lack of infrastructure, mainly things like buildings and places for storing hay or good fencing, which required quite an input of capital at the beginning.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:13:30):**  And the lack of those resources was meaning that businesses weren't as efficient as they could be.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:13:36):**  So, for example, one of the farmers was talking about how when they started they bought their land and they had about five thousand pounds of capital after they bought their land and two thousand pounds of that went off, was spent on putting in a track.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:13:52):**  So, for years and years they've had to do things like storing their hay under tarpaulins or using electric fencing, which although it can be effective, sometimes it's not so effective and animals escape.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  And that kind of drains the business because you're running out to cover the hay when there's a storm and stop it getting wet or you might lose the hay because it does get wet and then you're spending out on more forage and the animals escape or you're keeping the animals without a concrete yard, so you're wading around in mud.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:14:32):**  Having capital to invest in infrastructure from start just makes everything so much easier and more efficient and means that more can be done for the same effort rather than just draining the effort.  
**[0:14:47-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:14:47):**  What I'm finding interesting in thinking about where we go post Brexit is looking at the scale of farm subsidies that are being paid out each and every year just to keep farms going.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:15:04):**  I think if even a fraction of that could be diverted towards capital start-up grants, which would then enable small farms to develop and become efficient and then not need any subsidies at all.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:15:18):**  So I think that if money that goes into agriculture was being spent on helping develop the infrastructure and the tools and the training, that would actually create a much more resilient farming system, small resilient agro-ecological farms, they're actually minimising their input.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:15:37):**  The biggest cost really is labour for most of these farms and although that's a cost in one sense, I don't see that as being a big problem because that's income and that's creating livelihoods for people who then go and spend it in the local economy.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:15:52):**  These farms can be generating money that then can be used to pay workers without relying on a lot of subsidies, which I do think is possible, then that would be a really good way forward for agriculture.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:16:06):**  Well, in looking into how productivity and efficiency are measured in conventional terms, there seems to be a real bias towards looking at productivity per unit labour rather than productivity per unit land.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:16:21):**  It's quite hard to find statistics on productivity per unit land now because labour efficiency is just so much the measure of how successful a farm is. It would be very interesting to look at the increase over the next few years in productivity per unit land, which I think as knowledge grows could follow the productivity per unit labour graph.  
**[0:16:49-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:16:49):**  The productivity per unit labour, that implies that labour is a bad thing, whereas I think labour is a good thing and if we're wanting to employ people, which is often given as a measurement of economic success, then creating jobs on farms is a good thing and creating livelihoods on farms is a good thing.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:17:13):**  And particularly creating satisfying, diverse, socially enjoyable working environments is very valuable.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:17:23):**  I suppose the one thing that's really come out of this for me is that there's a real need for the small scale agroecological farming movement to be creating more data, to be keeping better records, because I think that if we're going to change policy to make it more supportive of what we're trying to do,  
**[0:17:49-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:17:49):**  I think we can't expect the government to just see that we're offering environmental benefits and social benefits. The government has really got to see convincing figures for how economically viable small farms can be and also how productive small farms can be.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:18:07):**  The argument that's always used against particularly organic farming, but also small scale farming is, well we need to feed the world and we've got to produce enough food to feed the world. Now that can be unpicked in many ways, I mean you can criticise that because you can say, well a lot of food is wasted.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  But ultimately I think we've got to be able to show that small farms can provide significant amounts of food and maybe even more food if the right training and the right security of land tenure and infrastructure is available.  
**[0:18:47-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:18:47):**  So I think it's essential that we're producing enough data and for that I think that we need to be creating comparable forms of data collection and also really easy to use record keeping methods for all farmers to be using.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:09):**  Because farmers are busy people and it's hard to encourage people to keep data and a lot of people have gone into farming because they're not so interested in figures and record keeping and economics, they want to get out there and be working on the land.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:26):**  But making it easy and appealing and offering incentives is really important.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  At the conference, Abbie also caught up with Charles Dowding, who runs a commercial market garden in Somerset.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  Since the 80s he's been growing many different vegetables organically and without disturbing or digging the soil at all.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:53):**  He's also a great experimenter and he's been doing comparison trials for many years.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:19:58):**  Charles is the no dig market garden expert and he told us about some of his latest trials and what he thinks is really going on down there in the soil.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:10):**  I'm Charles Dowding from Somerset, South West UK and I'm a market gardener, vegetable grower primarily and always organic.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:20):**  In fact in the 1980s that was the starring role part of my growth because people were fascinated.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  Gardening groups for example who I'd go and give talks to, you mean you can really grow vegetables organically, you don't need pesticide or fertiliser?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  That was the common response.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:38):**  I was a farmer's son, young man at that time.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:40):**  In 1982 it was a very chemical world, fertiliser and insecticides were predominant, they were bringing in the warble fly spray for example.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:50):**  In fact my brother got poisoned by organic phosphates in the 80s.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  It was just everywhere and I was seen as very odd for being organic.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:20:58):**  Now organic is seen as at least possible.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:01):**  By most people I think it's more a question of whether they want to do it.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:04):**  But in the 1980s I was also no dig.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:08):**  The interest in soil is quite a recent thing.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  I've been a member of the soil association since 1981.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:14):**  Even they only recently started talking about soil.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:18):**  But it's only recently that soil has become a topic of interest to many people.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:22):**  And that has led to much more interest in no dig or no till.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:27):**  Just to clarify the terms, no dig is more the British gardening word and I think in America it's more no till and farming is no till.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:35):**  But it's the same thing of not disturbing or disturbing the soil as little as possible.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:40):**  And it's about feeding soil.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:42):**  Initially I started with a rotavator I have to admit.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:45):**  Because it was the only tool I had was rotavating my father's pasture land.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:49):**  I rotavated an acre and a half and actually then I shaped up beds.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:52):**  I really like raised beds.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:54):**  So with a spade I shaped, took soil out of past, put it onto beds and I had my raised beds there.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  So the question then is how do you go from that if you're going to do any kind of cultivation without losing your beds.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:04):**  If I'd rotavated again it would have all gone flat and I'd have lost all that precious time I put into making these lovely beds.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:09):**  And so I started looking into whether, you know, do I need to cultivate?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:14):**  You know it's like perhaps I don't actually.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:16):**  And I found a book by Ruth Stout, an American gardener who was using her husband, a farmer, that spoiled hay as a mulch.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:25):**  And she found that everything grew fine doing that so why not just feed the soil with hay.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:31):**  Her reasoning was the cow hadn't eaten the hay so the goodness is still in there.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:34):**  I just put it straight on the ground and that's feeding my plants through feeding the soil.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:38):**  And so I actually bought some old hay at first and I thought I'll try that, mulch my beds with old hay like she does.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:45):**  And then the following spring so many of my plantings were killed, eaten by slugs.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:50):**  Duh! Where she's from, Midwest USA, continental dry climate, they don't have slugs.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:22:56):**  So that taught me the dangers of taking methods from one part of the world and bringing them into a different area.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:02):**  So you've got to always, if you're taking things off the internet particularly, it's not always said where they're coming from.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:08):**  So be very careful to make sure it's applicable to your condition.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  And in my work now I'm using compost as the mulch because that does not encourage slugs.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:18):**  So you know you could say I'm doing the same as Ruth Stout, she was mulching with hay, I'm mulching with compost.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:24):**  You're feeding soil, all your plants benefit in a very simple way.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:28):**  You're getting high yields for low input of time because that's the other brilliant thing about no dig, less weeds.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:34):**  You know in growing nowadays costs are the killer if you like.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:40):**  You know if you don't keep your costs down you will not survive as a grower or as a farmer really.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:45):**  So if you look at many growing operations it's one of the main costs is time spent weeding.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:49):**  Weeding is necessary, I'm not anti-weeding but I just want to keep it to a minimum.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:53):**  No-till undisturbed soil obviously doesn't grow weed seeds so much because you're not bringing them up to the surface.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:23:58):**  But there's one other very important factor which has been discovered by Elaine Ingham in the USA.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:04):**  That if you have a high fungal population near the surface of soil that discourages germination of pioneer weed seeds.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:14):**  Now this is a really important piece of knowledge and it's one explains for me something I've always noticed.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:20):**  Why my gardens grow so few weeds and you know it's like there's more going on here than just the fact that I'm not bringing up weed seeds.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:27):**  For me it's almost felt something like the soil is happy. Why does soil grow weeds in the first place?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  Weeds are often our response to cultivation and it's soil recovering itself.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:37):**  And if you then think of the meaning of that word recover it does have that other meaning.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:42):**  You know we need to recover if we've got an injury and that's how I see it when soil is disturbed, over disturbed particularly.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:49):**  It's injured and so it recovers with weeds. Even if some weeds are there they're less inclined to germinate the soil feels happier.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:24:55):**  That interesting that ties into you're talking about that you're doing some trials around forking some of the ground and no dig some of the ground.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:02):**  Can you explain about that?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:04):**  Absolutely I'm doing two separate trials actually well more than that.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:07):**  But the two main ones I'm doing dig no dig and on the original dig no dig which is now and it's stand here.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:13):**  And I turn over the soil and incorporate manure in trenches traditional single digging.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:19):**  And ten years of results on that trial show that eight years out of ten the no dig less work actually gives higher yield.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:26):**  And then in my new garden I've also started a separate trial where for the last three years I've got a bigger strip of ground two metres by nine metres.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:33):**  Where each of the six beds within that strip is forked before every single sowing or planting.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:39):**  So we put a garden fork in the ground about every six inches or so maybe a bit more to its full length which is eleven inches.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  And give it a wiggle to loosen the soil but without inversion.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:50):**  So in theory you think less intrusion into soil but maybe aeration or whatever it's supposed to do you know this broad forking idea.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:25:58):**  And then next to that similar strip two metres by nine metres no dig so basically no disturbance whatsoever.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:05):**  And the same amount of compost goes on top of each of these strips of ground.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:10):**  So again it's slightly different to my other dig no dig where the dug bed the soil is being incorporated.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:15):**  So three years results in each of the three years again the no dig is ahead in terms of harvest.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:21):**  So we grow the same vegetables in each of the strips and I record all the harvest which yeah it takes a bit of time.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:28):**  But it's actually a really enjoyable job because it's fascinating you know even apart from the fact I've got the trial results side by side.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:34):**  I'm also getting total yield figures which are getting more and more impressive as well.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:37):**  So that's a very nice body of evidence to have.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:39):**  The results this year were really quite staggering actually.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:42):**  Fifteen percent increase by doing less.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:45):**  What I think is happening or you know this suggests is happening the forking is disturbing the fungal threads.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:51):**  And if you think about it well that does make sense.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  So that any kind of intrusion into the soil that we do I think particularly with iron tools as well.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:00):**  You know this goes back to Victor Schauberger's work in Austria a hundred years ago where he invented copper tools and discovered that they.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:08):**  You've got much higher yields of wheat from using his famous copper plan than you did from using an iron plan for example.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:15):**  You know what's all that about.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:17):**  But you know I think that there could be an element of that as well.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:19):**  But for me the big one is soil life.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:22):**  You know I think that's the thing that we need to both protect and encourage for our businesses to be really successful and profitable and for us to spend less time doing it as well.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:31):**  Because it does seem that healthy soil with vibrant soil life across this whole spectrum.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:37):**  A diverse soil life is going to give you high yields for less input of time.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:42):**  Feeding the soil on the surface which is nature's way you know naturally all organic matter lands on the surface and then nature is equipped.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  It has equipped itself the soil with all these organisms that can take this matter in process it and turn it into plant food.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:27:57):**  And working with those processes I think is very exciting for farmers and growers.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:03):**  Abbie talking to Charles Dowding.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:06):**  If you're interested in learning more Charles runs courses on his farm.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:10):**  And I really think there's so much to learn if you've got the time to spend a day with him down there.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:15):**  He's also got a new garden diary out.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:18):**  So if you want to know a little bit more take a look at Charles Dowding.co.uk  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:35):**  Back to that intriguing and powerful voice from the start of the program.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:39):**  It belongs to Ashwini Shanakodi who's recently left her family farm in India to join her partner in the UK.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:46):**  Here she speaks to Dala Eno for Pharma Rama about her work in community development, the role of women in Indian agriculture and the calling back to her home.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:28:57):**  Also about the power of street play as a tool for civic engagement.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:02):**  Performances acted out on the streets in local languages in order to describe ideas, concepts and ways of understanding the world to people within local communities.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:13):**  And apologies for the small amount of machine noise in this recording.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:19):**  My name is Ashwini Shanakodi. I'm from India. I was born and brought up in an agricultural farm.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:25):**  I sometimes feel very guilty about the family farm being there and I'm here. I have to go back. That feeling is still there.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:35):**  Over the time I observed that how the farming is, transition is happening.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:43):**  What happened was that when I was growing up there was this disconnection from the farm myself.  
**[0:29:49-0:30:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:29:49):**  I myself went through that stage because you've been always told that okay let's do go work in the farm because it's something was imposed rather than came for me when I was kid.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:01):**  But over the time when I started going for college that's when I observed that there are other social problems which are not being discussed.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:09):**  We saw that there is alcoholism, there is financial problems where they are, problems with the abusers, different kinds of abusers.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:20):**  And people were not aware about lot of issues relating to, within agriculture maybe relating to industrial farming, the traditional farming.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:32):**  And straight play is an approach to convey the message to the people.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:37):**  So what we done was that I asked the college students to come join me and we trained them in a local language that is Kannada to speak with the local people and to convey what is happening, what is organic farming.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:30:55):**  What, who are the actors are in it, what happens when you call yourself as an organic farmer.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:01):**  Because many people won't read, how many people will read? I will read only which is required for me.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:07):**  But I feel always that visual media which is more effective rather than documents because that's where you express yourself.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:18):**  So there is still a connection, if I go back people will recognize me.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:24):**  It made lot of changes because it's not only me, many people are doing street play in India, across India.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:33):**  When it comes to if you are introducing any project, if you look at social media, if you look at internet also, you will find incident, you will find clips, stories about how street plays are being used.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:46):**  As a community you are part of that one community. If I am taking Oxford as a community whole example, each and every activity which is happening within Oxford becomes part of it.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:31:59):**  So if you tell that okay I have work but in my agriculture land and I am not able to become part of the community, then you are actually going away from the reality what is happening within your community.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:16):**  Yesterday they were talking about there is lot of education information is available but it is not available.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:23):**  It's not available in the mainstream, it's available if I am connected to you, I may get.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:29):**  But see I was coming and going for last two years to UK but I was not aware about many things.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:36):**  I was not connected with lot of networks because it's been from past one year I am here majority of my time.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:45):**  So I am able to connect now I know that these things are happening.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:49):**  We don't talk about the gender issues much. I haven't seen anybody talking about gender issues here in the conference.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:32:57):**  I see lot of girls here and they are interested in the topic, they have that interest.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:04):**  Do you say that because is it something you feel when you are back home is gender an issue in farming?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:10):**  Yes because lot of ladies they do lot of hard work and they are the people who preserve seeds, they are the people who transfer traditional knowledge.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:19):**  My mom she is a very good vegetable garden person. She knows how to do bee keeping.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:27):**  She knows how to because I learnt from her how to do basic bee keeping. I am still learning the skill.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:34):**  Everybody from surrounding area they come and collect seeds from her, vegetable seeds specially.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:41):**  Because people from small village like from my farm they took and it's there in Bangalore. Bangalore is a metro built in city.  
**[0:33:51-0:34:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:33:51):**  So people take it there and also they do some vegetable gardening inside the house. Still it's coming up.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:00):**  So the woman is actually like the pillar in Indian agriculture would you say?  
**[0:34:06-0:34:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:06):**  Yes they are the pillars because they are the people who go and work in the farm, in the land and they save the seeds for the next generation.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:18):**  Definitely they are the pillars.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:20):**  That is very inspiring because it is over here there is a bit of an archetype of the male farmer I think and there is still a lot of gender issues around strength and questioning about what women can bring to agriculture.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:37):**  And I think that's come with mechanisation.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:40):**  Yes because of the tillers and big tractors.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:45):**  Not valuing things like seed saving.  
**[0:34:48-0:35:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:34:48):**  If you have a family farm in UK or a 20, 50, 60 acres of land the management of it, everything they look after which is not being, we don't hear their stories.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:02):**  There is no narratives about the contribution of women in the agriculture of UK. That is one of the interesting research topic maybe.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:10):**  That was Dala speaking to Ashwini for Farmerama.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:14):**  And we are now going to go back to Abby once more on her family farm with a few points to follow that interview.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:22):**  I was so pleased that Ashwini brought up the lack of female narratives at the ORFC.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:27):**  Although the crowd in the room was quite well mixed, I too never once heard gender brought up.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:33):**  In the storytelling session two men spoke and I didn't hear them speak about a single story that involved a female farmer.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:41):**  I'm ashamed to say that for some reason I felt too scared to get up and say anything about it.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:46):**  Like we had much more pressing issues to worry about.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:49):**  But after much reflection I think biodiversity in the environment must be reflected in the narratives we tell.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:56):**  After all we are part of this environment.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:35:59):**  So not only do we need more female narratives but those of people from different backgrounds, religions and so on.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:06):**  If the farming community is going to generate a positive environment we must reflect that in our world view and the voices we share.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:13):**  ORFC was a huge success this year. I had a great time.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:17):**  And going forward something we would like to see more of is workshops.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:23):**  For example people could learn how to tell their story not just hear from someone who has been successful telling their story.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:30):**  And things like that.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:32):**  I really hope things in Chile get back to some order soon and people stop lighting the fires.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:39):**  You can follow what's going on on our twitter at VidaCycle.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:44):**  We live in a crazy world.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:53):**  Thank you all for listening to Vama Vama this week and every week.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:36:57):**  And thank you to all this week's contributors Joy, Darla and Nigel, Lauren, Phil and Richard at ORFC and Owen who recorded the new music we've had on today's show.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:37:15):**  And of course thank you to all of our guests.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:37:18):**  We're very much looking forward to the rest of the year.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/18-farmerama#t=0:37:22):**  We'll be back next time with more voices from the smaller scale farming movement in the UK and beyond.

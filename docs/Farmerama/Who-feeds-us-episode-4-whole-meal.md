**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:00):**  Who Feeds Us? From Farmerama. Episode 4. Wholemeal.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:13):**  My name is Abigail Horsbrough. I am the lead miller at Bricks and Windmill. I've been milling  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:19):**  there for four years this year.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:21):**  I'm Rosie and I'm a baker in Bristol. I've been baking for maybe eight or so years now.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:28):**  I'm Rosie Gray. I have Reviving Food, which is a mobile micro bakery using UK grown grains  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:35):**  and as much local ingredients as I can find to produce wholesome breads and pastries to  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:40):**  feed the neighbourhood round about here.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:42):**  I'm so sorry that someone just turned up now with their car. I'm just like being recorded  
**[0:00:47-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:47):**  for a podcast. I'm still open. I'm still open, but it's just it's being recorded.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:55):**  At the start of lockdown, as people panic brought bread and then flour, those of us  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:00:59):**  who might not otherwise have thought to seek out a local bakery, let alone a local mill,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:05):**  started to do just that. As we'll hear, this sudden upsurge in demand was a huge challenge  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:12):**  for these small scale bakers and millers. But it was a challenge they met with enthusiasm  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:17):**  and ingenuity, as well as a deep sense of responsibility to their communities.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:25):**  At one time, pretty much every town and village had its own flour mill, driven by wind or  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:31):**  water. Today, across the whole of London, just one working windmill remains, Brixton  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:38):**  Windmill. It's a unique heritage site with a rich educational programme. But as lockdown  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:44):**  began, the mill became much more than a historic curiosity. And its volunteers found themselves  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:50):**  providing a vital service to the local community. Miller Abigail Halsborough explains.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:01:55):**  I suppose for us as volunteers, we were unsure if we were allowed to keep volunteering because  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:01):**  before everything went crazy, we still had our regular orders that we wanted to fulfil.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:05):**  And we weren't sure if we could be classed as key workers or key volunteers or not, and  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:09):**  we would be allowed out. And then the stockpiling started kind of picking up with people in  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:14):**  supermarkets and obviously, you know, besides toilet roll, the next thing to go was flour.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:19):**  And so we had floods of emails and messages on Instagram and phone calls, not just the  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:24):**  shops and bakeries that we'd already stocked in, it was new shops, it was some people literally  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:27):**  just being like, I'd like to order X amount of kilos for my road. It was just a lot at  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:33):**  one time, we were trying obviously to meet demand as best as we could, but we're all  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:38):**  volunteers, myself included. And we very quickly realised we had to kind of put a stop on things.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:43):**  So there was a lot of people that we turned away in terms of shops, mostly because of  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:47):**  the logistics, like all the shops that we're stocked in anywhere, all in South London,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:51):**  there was some in North London, there was some out of London that were approaching us  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:54):**  and it just got a bit ridiculous. There were other mills around the country that are also,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:02:59):**  if not completely volunteer run, like mostly volunteer run. And I feel like at the same  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:04):**  time, we were all trying to step up and obviously meet demand for people who suddenly bake and  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:08):**  bread five times a week or whatever it was they were doing. But we've never milled at  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:12):**  like full capacity or higher capacity. We used to just mill once a fortnight and there  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:18):**  was a point at the start of lockdown where I was in the mill three to four times a week.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:22):**  Obviously it puts a strain on us physically as volunteers, but then also our actual machinery,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:27):**  it's really old. Some of the parts have been there since the early 1900s and we don't want  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:31):**  to damage what is a beautiful heritage building and machinery to meet such short term demands.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:38):**  Before, when we were delivering, it might be, I don't know, me or another volunteer  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:42):**  just like jumping on our bike and dropping it down to the shop. But because we had so  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:45):**  many orders, we had to get other volunteers to do deliveries and again, making sure that  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:50):**  they're safe and they feel safe to do the deliveries. And yeah, it was a lot of e-bills.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:03:55):**  For me personally, it was really good for my mental health. When everything around you  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:03):**  feels like it's going up in flames, the panic that you feel and losing the things in life  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:11):**  that kind of keep you grounded, whether that's like going to your workplace every day, or  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:15):**  for me it was uni or freelance projects that I had coming up that I was really looking  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:19):**  forward to all suddenly gone. Going to the mill, that is a familiar space where I repeat  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:24):**  the same process that someone's been doing for hundreds of years before me is quite meditative  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:29):**  and that is a good thing. And then when we started donating flour to the local food banks,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:35):**  again, it definitely did give me a sense of purpose because I felt like, yeah, I was doing  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:39):**  something good for people in our very immediate area. So the windmill itself is literally  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:44):**  in the middle of an estate, Blenheim Gardens Estate in Brixton. And that was the first  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:47):**  food bank that we started donating to. And then we went a bit further out to Brixton  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:52):**  and Norwood Food Bank. This one woman got quite emotional when we were talking and she  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:04:57):**  was just saying, you know, losing your job at a time like this and depending on services  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:01):**  like the food bank, you're obviously grateful that they're there and you're grateful for  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:04):**  the people that can help out. But it's just this kind of shock and confusion that this  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:08):**  is what things come to for a lot of families in this country. And it just feels good to  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:13):**  just, even if it's a tiny help, just to be helping. The farm that we buy our grain from,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:19):**  it's actually a collective of farms called Organic Arable based in Hertfordshire. They  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:23):**  reached out to us. They were like, we've seen what you guys are doing and we think it's  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:27):**  amazing. We want to donate some grain to you, a ton of grain, which is mad. Things like  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:32):**  that, people have just really got behind us wanting to get behind other people. You know,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:36):**  as things start to pick back up and lives or people get more used to working from home,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:41):**  whatever the new thing is for them, you kind of assume and in a sad way that people will  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:46):**  stop volunteering or they'll volunteer less, but everyone's been really committed and we  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:50):**  were kind of worried we wouldn't have enough manpower, but yeah, people have really stepped  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:53):**  up and it's been really great to see.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:05:58):**  Bristol based baker Rosie Benson has spent the last few years investigating the connections  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:03):**  between her bread, the farms that produce the grain and crucially the soil in which  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:08):**  that grain grows. As lockdown hit, she brought together everything she's learned to provide  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:14):**  nourishing loaves to the people who needed them most. She set up a bakery and called  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:19):**  it Bread and Roses.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:23):**  The name Bread and Roses came from the idea of providing sustenance as well as beauty  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:32):**  and dignity around giving people choice to better food. It didn't really exist until  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:38):**  lockdown happened. Because I'd been working for various bakeries, I wasn't actually a  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:42):**  long term employee. So I was a bit out of work. I was suddenly a baker without a bakery,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:47):**  but I was lucky enough to have access to some amazing grain which Fred at Goulthney Farm  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:52):**  in Somerset and actually a couple of other farms had given me. With those grains, I had  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:06:58):**  the chance to do something and with the network that I have in Bristol, it all kind of fitted  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:04):**  together very easily. And I just wanted to be making the kind of bread that I believe  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:09):**  in. So using grains that I'd source, fresh milling as much as I could and using long  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:14):**  fermentation. I found a set up of a bakery in the south of Bristol, which a friend runs  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:20):**  called Alley. I could rent the space off him per day. I bought some secondhand tins and  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:26):**  I started baking loaves that went out through the really brilliant Coexist Community Kitchen,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:33):**  which is based in Easton in Bristol. They've been making hot meals for people over lockdown  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:39):**  and they ran a crowd funder which paid for those meals and paid for a loaf of bread each  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:45):**  week for people accessing the charities 125 and Second Step, which is a mental health  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:07:53):**  charity in Bristol. There was money available to source that food and to work with some  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:00):**  amazing producers and I was one of the bakers that they chose, which was really great because  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:06):**  I wanted to be making food at that time. There was this sense of urgency and I mean there  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:11):**  always is actually really with bread and with getting good food out there to people. Like  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:16):**  so many people could benefit from having better bread that don't. Unfortunately, the funding  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:22):**  for that came to an end a couple of weeks ago. So the last loaves went out to those  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:27):**  groups then and they went out to a bread subscription. So not just to the Coexist Community Kitchen,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:34):**  but to a doorstop delivery. Bread subscriptions are a great model because you've got a guaranteed  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:41):**  customer base and there was people that really wanted to join the subscription when lockdown  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:45):**  went into force because there was this sudden rush to know where their food was coming.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:51):**  Like this fear that it was suddenly going to run out or something. And it went out with  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:08:56):**  some salad that was grown by Edible Futures in Bristol, which is an urban salad grower.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:02):**  A friend called Humphrey runs that. And then also another friend, Josh, he produces a plant  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:08):**  milk called tiger milk. And the three things, so bread, milk, salad went out together on  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:14):**  the same delivery route, which was much more efficient and less time consuming than individual  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:20):**  bread drops because it's quite hard to make bread affordable when you've got to deliver  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:26):**  to an actual door, rather than people coming to pick it up themselves. By combining the  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:32):**  three, it just made it more possible that we could keep doing bread at the price we  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:37):**  wanted. Even though the number of loaves were not that many that were going to Coexist Community,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:43):**  I needed to combine those two jobs within the day and rent the space together because  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:48):**  it just made financial sense. I couldn't really afford to do it separately. It had to be that  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:09:53):**  I was making bread that people paid for, as well as giving my time to make bread that  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:00):**  was subsidised. So I think it would be hard to do just one or the other.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:07):**  That was all a bit of a whirlwind of what happened in three and a half months. And it  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:13):**  was brilliant to be doing. It felt important and I was baking the kind of bread that I  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:20):**  really agree with, which was great. And it was a real kick up the arse. With lockdown  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:27):**  as well, it's really narrowed and focused me into doing something that I care about  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:31):**  and I'm really passionate about doing. I think always as a baker, you want to provide  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:37):**  good bread. And when you're out of production, you've got all this energy that you need to  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:44):**  put somewhere. So yes, the job of being a baker is really physical. It's a lot of moving  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:50):**  around and you have to keep a certain pace going to be efficient. I think a lot of bakers,  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:10:55):**  now that they've got some systems in place, don't fear a second lockdown as much. So that  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:02):**  will be helpful because it is stressful when you know that people are relying on you for  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:08):**  food or to access to good food. It is quite a stressful thing to go through, as it has  
**[0:11:14-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:14):**  been for so many people in different ways, lockdown and continues to be.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:23):**  Meanwhile at the other end of the country, another Rosie was also busy baking. Rosie  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:28):**  Gray spent some of her childhood near the village of Kincraig in the Scottish Highlands.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:33):**  Shortly before the pandemic, she returned there to set up her own bakery in a converted  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:38):**  horse box. So much of my life, I've had like lots of different seasonal jobs, been mobile  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:44):**  a lot of my life and part of being in a horse box is to do with not really committing as  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:48):**  well to being in the premises. But I live here and it's in the driveway and I'm really  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:11:56):**  becoming much more settled within the community. I've been living here full time since January  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:01):**  now. I've been based here on and off since I was about 11. But it's just really amazing  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:05):**  now to get to know all these different characters and what they're doing. And I get folk come  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:09):**  by to get bread, but they're like, oh, do you know a joiner? And I'm like, yeah, Jack's  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:13):**  a joiner. And oh, do you happen to know a painter? Yeah, Pete's a painter.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:16):**  Today is the first day Scottish schools are back today. So I'm open from eight in the  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:20):**  morning and I had parents after the school run coming by and I've got builders on their  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:24):**  way to work and like they're coming by as well. You get a right good chat and what kind  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:29):**  of bread they like and what their opinions are on different things. It's really settled  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:33):**  within the community like that. It's really lovely. But my mum was here at the weekend  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:37):**  and folk were like, oh, it's really great what Rosie's doing. Because this village,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:42):**  it could very easily be a satellite place. There's a cafe and there's an outdoor centre  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:46):**  that has a restaurant and now there's me doing the bread. So I've had a lot of feedback from  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:51):**  folk just being like, yeah, it's really great that we can get food here. And I guess what  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:54):**  I'm trying to say is like I'm making bread, but how much more that actually really is  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:12:59):**  as well to it. Today was really cool because there's a little forest schools nursery and  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:03):**  so the kids all walk past down the street and they were walking by and they're like,  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:07):**  oh, look what's happening because today's the first day of that as well. And I was like,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:10):**  oh guys come over. So I had like seven, I guess like three or four year olds here out  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:14):**  the front and I gave them some baguette to taste and they're going to come by. One of  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:18):**  them just complained because they didn't have any jam. So they're bringing their jam tomorrow  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:21):**  and I've got wheat that I got from Rupert at Tourthetere. When I was down in Oxford,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:25):**  he gave me a bag of population mix from there. So I've got some of that growing in the garden.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:29):**  They come to buy the bread and they're like, wait a minute, you bake in here too? Yeah,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:32):**  it's all in here. Come up the ramp, you see. And then they stand and they watch. I can  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:36):**  be like, oh, sorry, are you in a hurry? Can you wait a couple of minutes? And they're  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:40):**  like, yes, totally. And they'll watch you load the bread in the oven and stuff too.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:43):**  So just closer connections to how things are being done with their food. So what's interesting  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:51):**  is folk are like, are you doing this because of COVID? I'm like, well, no, I was going  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:13:55):**  to do this anyway, but it's totally been shaped by COVID. There's been really bad parts to  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:00):**  the whole lockdown and like, because I've been living alone, working alone and I really  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:04):**  like speaking to folks. So it's been pretty tough like that. But coronavirus, the positives  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:09):**  of it has been that it has definitely shaped the way that my business has evolved from  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:14):**  selling bread in the pub and having another job to then guys, do you want bread on Wednesdays  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:19):**  and Saturdays? I'll bring it to you. So then I instantly like went overnight into sure  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:25):**  I'll bake bread and bring it to your house tomorrow morning. And that's how I got these  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:27):**  brags printed, these yellow bags. So I just went around and hung them on folks door handles  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:31):**  to then changing that to days because the weather got hotter. So I couldn't do it overnight.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:37):**  Then with the cafe asking for more bread now, I was like, well, sure they want bread. When  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:41):**  the cafe opened, this is literally three weeks ago now and they want bread Friday, Saturday,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:45):**  Sunday and then Thursday. So I was like, okay, cool. Well, I'll do Tuesday, Wednesday, cause  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:48):**  I'm baking all those other days for the local subscription. So they pay monthly and they  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:53):**  have their regular orders, but now folks just come by when they feel like it. So I was taking  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:14:57):**  bread to some people twice a week and it was only after four months I saw their faces cause  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:02):**  they were proper isolating, like shielding. And then they came out and it was like, wow.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:06):**  And it was turning into quite a wee loop. They'd come out, they'd take their dogs for  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:09):**  a walk, pick up the eggs, which were available for sale behind the cafe. And then they come  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:14):**  and get their fresh bread. And so there's all these wicker baskets appearing and stuff,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:17):**  you know, as well.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:22):**  Folk have died obviously during this too. So they were like kind of able to talk about  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:26):**  that and like, you just couldn't go around to folks houses and you know, and be like,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:30):**  oh, I'm sorry about this. Or, you know, just all those kinds of conversations were happening  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:33):**  as well as like noticing different birds. There's been mad amount of like little grouse  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:39):**  chicks on the footpaths of like Monroe's that are normally really walked loads. It's been  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:44):**  really great to develop my role within the community that has so much responsibility  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:49):**  to it like that to do with their people's health. And I learned that from Joe at Riot  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:53):**  Riot. He used to talk about this all the time to do with like the responsibility that bakers  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:15:57):**  have to do with sourcing of ingredients to do with like people should be able to just  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:02):**  live, not just live off your bread, but you know, your bread is their bread. And so there's  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:08):**  a responsibility to have like some wholemeal in it or start, or, you know, to think things  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:13):**  through that it's not all maybe super white process and sugary potentially, but like,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:20):**  yeah, just keeping it wholesome. And I just really love, yeah, just chatting to folk and  
**[0:16:26-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:26):**  finding out what's going on.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:35):**  It's a really long process as a baker. Like you start by just getting your hands in the  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:39):**  dough and then you learn about all these other things that you should be taking notice of  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:44):**  and it becomes more and more complex and it really keeps you in it if you engage with  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:48):**  the farming side of it and creating a really interesting job that's sustainable and doesn't  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:54):**  just wear you out. It's been a brilliant journey, especially in the last couple of years.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:16:59):**  Rosie Benson and Rosie Gray are part of a growing movement of bakers who believe that baking  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:04):**  good bread, tasty, nourishing, environmentally sustainable, affordable bread means actively  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:11):**  engaging with the ingredients, understanding where they come from and who produced them  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:16):**  and how. They're building direct relationships, not only with their customers, but also with  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:22):**  farmers and millers.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:24):**  It's an exciting time to be a baker. There's a definite thirst for knowing more and a demand  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:30):**  for regional grain. Bakers are getting way more educated about the need for diversity  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:35):**  in what they put in their bread and then also trying to think about how to get that out  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:40):**  to everybody and make it as accessible as possible.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:44):**  I was living out of a tent, working in a bakery in a living history museum for about five  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:48):**  or six months. So that was last year and that's when I really decided I want to make the bread,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:52):**  I want to make using the ingredients and getting to know the folk that's growing it and milling  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:17:58):**  it and share the stories basically. And that's what this has turned into is doing it on this  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:03):**  smaller scale and being based in a horse box in a village. There's a customer coming over  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:07):**  right now actually as well. But like, yeah, being based in a village in a quirky bright  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:12):**  yellow horse box, it kind of gets a bit of attention and then I can start having these  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:17):**  conversations and stories with folks.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:20):**  I'm very honest with people that I'm not a baker and I've never been a baker. I think  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:25):**  for me, like bread, my mum's family are from Jamaica. My grandparents came here in the  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:31):**  60s I think. And bread for us, there were different breads for different occasions.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:36):**  So hardo bread is our main bread and it's quite a stodgy bread, but there's a special  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:40):**  shaped hardo bread that you have at weddings or christenings and it's like literally in  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:44):**  the shape of like a swan or a duck and it's very decorative. And then this other thing  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:49):**  that was like, I don't even know what it's called. It's just like this basically like  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:51):**  a rock cake that my nan would make for us as well. And yeah, I think bread has always  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:18:56):**  kind of marked out special occasions or special things happening where the family's coming  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:00):**  together and you know, someone's going to bring that along. And yeah, it's really important.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:04):**  I think obviously as a teenager and in my twenties, I probably ate quite a lot of processed  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:10):**  food as everyone else did. A sucker for like a white muffin, toasted white muffin, but  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:16):**  I think that's okay in moderation. It's more that that shouldn't be the only thing available.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:21):**  It was just a vehicle for the jam. Baking kind of links to so many parts of what nourishes  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:29):**  me. I'm not always the most technically perfect baker, but I'm definitely one that's keen  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:36):**  to keep evolving as a baker. It's not about perfection. It's about sustaining people.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:42):**  I'm not after the perfect loaf. I'm after a loaf that I believe in. I want to be part  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:48):**  of a system that builds soil and looks towards future health of the planet rather than one  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:19:54):**  that mines the soil and ignores what's happening on the land.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:00):**  It was the same with gardening and stuff too. You know when you just like totally find yourself  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:04):**  in a new world and you just feel like you've got this opportunity sat on a plate right  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:10):**  in front of you, but I don't even know the questions to ask to find out. So I remember  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:14):**  really feeling like that yet to know so little to not even know how to start asking. And  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:22):**  now it's amazing to now be able to have conversations.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:26):**  I love old things and old buildings. I'm very invested in helping to preserve the physical  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:32):**  objects and buildings, but also the stories of the people that have helped to make them  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:35):**  what they are. I also drive the train at the Postal Museum. It's called the Mail Rail and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:40):**  it's a miniature train. It goes underground. It's only got about 1.5 kilometres of track,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:44):**  but yeah, it's really cool.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:50):**  We'd always kind of start around 10. It always starts with a good cleaning job. Any windmill  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:20:56):**  or kind of bakery, flowery space, spiders love it. Ladybirds love it. And any other  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:03):**  crawly things. So we make sure we give everything a good sweep and sanitise surfaces. After  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:08):**  that, we've got to make sure we grease the machinery. We've got really big cogs underneath  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:12):**  the stones that we keep oiled. And then literally just dragging down a sack of grain or two  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:18):**  sacks, depending on how much we're milling, getting that into the machine, switching it  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:22):**  on and just letting it do its thing. So once the machine's actually up and running, it  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:26):**  normally takes about, I don't know, 45 minutes to an hour for it to work through one sack  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:31):**  of grain. We have a cup of tea in the meantime and then get in ready to bag it all up. And  
**[0:21:36-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:36):**  we do all of that by hand. Then yeah, it's all ready for delivery.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:47):**  So I'd aim to get in there actually quite a leisurely start at eight o'clock in the  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:52):**  morning. I'd done the leaven build earlier at home. The leaven build is the pre-ferment  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:21:58):**  of flour going into the main mix of the dough. I'd work on my own, which is how it was safer  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:04):**  during COVID. I'd mix up up to maybe a hundred loaves in a morning using the mixers. So not  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:12):**  that many in comparison to some bigger bakery production, but on your own, it feels quite  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:17):**  enough to do, especially when you've got a very small deck oven to try and fill it through.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:22):**  And I just ferment most of the day, do all the packaging, do all the kind of organizing  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:27):**  of when it was going to go out. It was nice because I was making my own bread formulas,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:33):**  casting out ideas. I did a lot of scalds and porridges, sifted out different fractions  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:37):**  of the grain and tried to kind of play around with some ideas that I had around using emmer  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:42):**  that Fred had grown. So sprouting that and popping that back in the dough. So making  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:48):**  something that was more along the lines of a whole grain bread, but still had some of  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:22:53):**  the aesthetics of a whiter hearth form loaf. For those, I don't know, 16 weeks or so of  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:00):**  just playing around with some ideas that I had and having an outlet for that bread rather  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:05):**  than just doing one at home. I was able to be a lot more creative on my own.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:10):**  Well, I'm kind of running two schedules a minute. So I've got one Roffco. I'm baking  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:15):**  about 12 loaves at a time. I choose to have my local orders. So I'll start at six, mixing.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:21):**  Everything is done ambiently at the moment. So I don't have a big fridge to put things  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:25):**  in overnight. So I start mixing at six, shaping at like 11 or 12, start baking things from  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:33):**  about 2.30. People start coming to collect about 5pm. But I'm also then starting mixing  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:40):**  for stuff that goes overnight. So I'll start mixing that. I aim for about 3pm, but it's  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:46):**  often a bit later. So I still end up in here about 1am, 2am. I then nip out and do some  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:52):**  deliveries about 7pm. I was delivering more by bike before, but it's kind of, it turned  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:23:59):**  into more bread and longer distances. And then I asked people if they were nearby to  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:03):**  come and collect. That's been a change. As lockdown eased a bit, I asked if they could  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:07):**  come here instead. So this is the display, but there's not that much left in the display  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:14):**  now. I made some rye bread. The baguettes have all gone. And then my scale, I've like  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:19):**  weighed out the stuff of the buns. I'm drying bannetons in the sun right now there. And  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:24):**  then this is like the counter and it's all open. There's my van. It's all spread by word  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:28):**  of mouth and like a bit of Facebook and whatnot. But, and I have a painted sign at the gate,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:34):**  which honestly is unbelievable the amount of business having a painted sign makes. It's  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:37):**  really obvious, but I think we forget about that sometimes because we live in such digital  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:42):**  worlds that you've got this amazing online presence and all these followers or whatnot  
**[0:24:46-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:46):**  online, but are they the people that eat your bread?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:55):**  So when we get deliveries in the mill, you can get the truck as close as possible to  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:24:58):**  the actual physical mill. But then in terms of getting it up three flights of stairs,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:04):**  before we used to literally like have to carry the sacks up the stairs. And now we've got  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:08):**  a, it's like a winch on the top floor. So I go up on the top and I've got a harness  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:13):**  on. I don't look cool at all. And then we lower the exacts down so that we can fill  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:18):**  it up and bring it up. And yeah, it was just exciting. Just like getting more. It's like,  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:21):**  are there any more bags? It's like, yep, we've got 10 more. And yeah, we were just all really  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:25):**  happy that day.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:31):**  It was nice to hear from friends and farmers that had been pivoting as well. And it felt  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:38):**  like we were supporting each other. This was a time of great change and it was uncomfortable,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:44):**  but it was helpful because there was the hope that people would appreciate flour and where  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:48):**  it came from a little bit more. I think that's been a good part of it.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:53):**  What has been really interesting for me is ordinarily, you know, people that buy our  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:25:57):**  flour, sometimes people will tweet pictures in of the stuff they bake. And you know, it's  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:00):**  typical like sourdoughs or a lot of people do pizza, pizza bases and things like that.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:05):**  But I gave a bag of flour to a friend of mine halfway through lockdown and she sent me back  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:09):**  a picture of doubles. It's like a Trinidadian. It looks similar to a dumpling maybe. You  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:14):**  can fill it with stuff or just have it on the side of your meal. I was really excited  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:18):**  to see like a Caribbean dish made with bricks and wimel flour. And I want to see more of  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:24):**  that really.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:25):**  My top fear was loneliness because when you start to feel lonely, then it just spirals  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:30):**  and everything else starts to fall apart. And coronavirus forced that on me. So now  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:37):**  I'm like, okay, cool. Well, I just done five months of loneliness. Now it's so lovely to  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:41):**  have folk to chat to. And I think maybe, yeah, I do appreciate that and realise the importance  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:46):**  of that even more now. Like every day is like a performance because I have all these characters  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:51):**  that come into my life. There's nobody that comes every day, but they're coming multiple  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:26:56):**  times a week. Yeah, that's what's really lovely. But there's honestly funny moments  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:00):**  and ridiculousness. The stuff on the news, like, you know, there's so much right now  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:06):**  that's really sad, but there's actually so many amazing things that have come out of  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:12):**  this COVID stuff too, do you know? And it can all seem really dark very easily. And  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:18):**  some days it really doesn't. It's like the sun coming out.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:23):**  For me again, on a personal level, I struggle with saying no to things or like dealing with  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:29):**  the guilt of saying no to things. My mental health, I've kind of struggled with that for  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:33):**  a while. And there were some days during lockdown where I just physically didn't want to leave  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:39):**  my bed and telling the other volunteers or people, you know, if we've got deliveries  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:44):**  expected to go out, telling them that I couldn't go or like I wasn't feeling great, I felt  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:49):**  guilty or a bit ashamed because you feel like you let anyone else down and everyone's constantly  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:53):**  telling you what an amazing thing you're doing and how great you must feel. And like, yes,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:27:57):**  there are days when I felt like that, but there were also days when I was just really  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:00):**  worried about, you know, what was happening and what was going to happen in terms of my  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:04):**  future and my job and all of these kinds of things. That was tough. And then I think,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:08):**  if you've been asked a few times to do things like this, like interviews and talking about  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:12):**  what we're doing, and that's good, as I said, because it gets the word out and we get a  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:17):**  lot more people kind of volunteering and things like that. The to-do list never ends and you  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:21):**  get to a point where you're like, it's a lot.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:27):**  Having a business around direct personal relationships with suppliers and customers also helps everyone  
**[0:28:33-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:33):**  involved to understand the value of what they're growing, milling, baking or eating.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:43):**  I'm tired of the facelessness of food production, I guess. Working in a wholesale bakery environment,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:51):**  you don't have the contact with the customers. You don't see who's eating it. You get the  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:28:56):**  feedback, but you get it through a delivery driver. But when they're standing right in  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:00):**  front of you and they see your face, and I see their face, I think that's part of what  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:04):**  it is I want to do. It's accountability as well. My core thing behind it all is about  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:09):**  reducing our impact on the environment through food, through doing it on a human scale. I  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:14):**  want to have the faces of the people that's involved with this on the wall. So this is  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:18):**  my current rant I'm having at the minute. Everyone that's involved with growing the  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:22):**  food displayed. It's not just me. Like I was just saying there to those folk, there's  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:26):**  farmers, there's millers, there's, but you see me here and you see my bread, but there's  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:30):**  all of this that's still faceless within it. Real folk and real food engaging with  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:36):**  people differently, working with telling stories and curiosity. It can get people questioning  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:41):**  their choices of things. I can stand there and get angry and raise my fist about stuff,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:47):**  but this is another way of doing it that's maybe less confrontational. What we started  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:53):**  doing with the food bank donations and when we've been dropping flour to the shops is  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:29:59):**  giving these tiny leaflets. So the leaflets give people a bit more background about who  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:03):**  we are and the mill and how long it's been there. All we mill is wholemeal flour. So  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:08):**  the benefits of wholemeal flour and also just some tips for people who've never really used  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:12):**  wholemeal flour before, or even for people who've never used flour that's as fresh as  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:15):**  ours before. So a lot of the flour you buy in the supermarkets, it could have been sat  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:19):**  somewhere in storage for months before it's got to the shelves, whereas ours, I'm milling  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:23):**  today, I'm milling at about two o'clock. I'll mill and that'll probably go out in the afternoon  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:28):**  and potentially someone could use that at seven o'clock this evening to bake something.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:32):**  And that changes the way that it reacts when you're cooking with it and baking with it.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:36):**  So yeah, we've got these little leaflets we give out to people. They're not overly political,  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:39):**  but I hope it gets them asking questions about where their food comes from and how it affects  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:44):**  them.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:45):**  So I just put my prices up on the 1st of August there. By standing here and selling it all  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:50):**  day you realise a pound for a cinnamon bun is actually potentially too cheap. I don't  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:30:57):**  know anyone else that's selling it for that and that doesn't really include much of my  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:03):**  costs. And so my country loaf is now £3.50, it used to be £3.30 and a pint of beer is  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:09):**  about £3.50. So as a point of reference it was actually interesting to start with.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:14):**  But I have another situation where I've got friends who can't afford it, so we have different  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:19):**  things on the go. So he takes really good photos and he's always on Mad Adventures with  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:23):**  his bike. So he's basically my first sponsored athlete. So he came by earlier today actually  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:29):**  and he's just like, he'll tell me like, I am going up this mountain tomorrow, can I  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:34):**  have a cardamom bun? And I'm like, yeah, sure. And then he goes and he takes a photo of it  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:37):**  on the mountain or something, you know. So there's things like that as well.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:44):**  The thing behind it is not to make money. It needs to make money, but the point of it  
**[0:31:48-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:48):**  is to feed the community here. And that's the priority behind it all. So yeah, the prices  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:31:57):**  have gone up by like 20p. You assume the person that's baking the bread is being paid fairly,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:02):**  you'd assume that. And so that should be the case.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:06):**  So what does the future hold for Rosie Benson, Rosie Gray and Abigail?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:12):**  From last week, I've been running something called Field Bakery. And we have set up a  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:18):**  workshop space on Fred's farm in Golfinie. And we bring people out there for day workshops  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:25):**  where they learn sourdough and they learn how to use local grain. They get to meet the  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:30):**  piglets and they just have a really nice time away from the city and learn a little bit  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:37):**  more about the connection with where cereal crops and diverse crops could come from.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:42):**  Once a month, I'll be doing a bake that goes alongside when he puts out the meat boxes.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:49):**  And then people will be able to taste the whole farm, the grain and the pork. And I'll  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:53):**  probably be freshly milling a lot of the flour that goes into that, using some of the grains  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:32:58):**  that he's got available because harvest has just happened, which has been quite an exciting  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:04):**  time to be down on the farm. Lots of working quite late, the floodlights on.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:09):**  When I was talking about my friend who'd made Trinny doubles with our flour, I am very,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:19):**  very, very keen to get a Brixton Wimnell hardo bread made. There are so many Caribbean takeaways  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:25):**  and bakeries in the area. We've been here for like 40 years, the same family running  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:28):**  this bakery for that long. And I think that would be a really great way for us to connect  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:32):**  with specifically Caribbean communities in the area and to be more visible as well, because  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:37):**  the mill itself is actually quite tucked away. You can't see it even from the main road,  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:40):**  you can't see it. So if we had our flour in those kinds of shops, just showing people  
**[0:33:45-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:45):**  again that we exist and we want people to engage, I hope it would help.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:55):**  This is what my life now looks like and I absolutely love it. I guess I had a moment  
**[0:33:59-0:34:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:33:59):**  the other week where I actually phoned my mum and I was just like, I have the display  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:08):**  of bread that I dreamed of and I'm standing in my horse box with my music on, chatting  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:14):**  to folk with bread that I'm super proud of. Yeah, I'm having moments like every day at  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:20):**  the moment, kind of like that, of just how it's come about and how grateful I am to everyone  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:26):**  else that's been involved and encouraging and supportive. All of their stories that  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:32):**  come into this. I am where I wanted to be, but I would never have imagined the route  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:38):**  it's taken to get to this. And I've got a bit of an idea as to where I'm going next.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:44):**  I guess that's another wee project working towards that, but it's still to do with like  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:48):**  local food, more local food, vegetables is another bit I want to kind of add on with  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:53):**  this now. I feel very optimistic having these new volunteers  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:34:58):**  who as I said, continue to be committed and not only are they showing up and doing things  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:03):**  that need to be done, but they're coming to us with new ideas for things that we could  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:06):**  do, new ways we can reach out to people that we wouldn't have otherwise thought of. In  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:10):**  Kennetton Park, there's this charity and they have a few beehives, but it's also a community  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:15):**  garden and so they sell local honey, but they also make products out of the pollen and things  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:19):**  like that. And I walked in and I was like, oh, I'm really excited. You guys are great.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:23):**  And like, I want to do something with you. And they're like, you guys are great. We've  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:26):**  heard about Ricks and Wimble and like that moment of just, yeah, meeting more people  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:31):**  virtually or in person who are running things in communities and are excited about changing  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:37):**  things and wanting to work with more people. It can only ever get bigger and yeah, it's  
**[0:35:43-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:43):**  going to be great. Everything should be linking back to the soil  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:52):**  in terms of what we put out there to people and opening up our plates to more interesting  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:35:58):**  food. We've narrowed far too much and it's time to rediscover flavor and experience and  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:04):**  engage with where our food comes from. Find your local miller, find your local baker and  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:10):**  ask more questions about where their grain is coming from, where their flour is coming  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:14):**  from importantly, because if consumers don't demand it and us bakers don't listen to what's  
**[0:36:22-0:36:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:22):**  happening out in the field, then we're not going to have a future of good food basically.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:30):**  Rosie Gray, Rosie Benson and Abigail are engaged in building a better system. A system that  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:36):**  looks very different to the one that produces most of the bread we eat in the UK today.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:41):**  When inflexible, centralized supermarket supply chains buckled, they were able to carry on  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:47):**  producing flour, baking bread and feeding people thanks to the localized, adaptable,  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:53):**  human scale infrastructure they're part of. So how can we grow that infrastructure? How  
**[0:36:59-0:37:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:36:59):**  can we all become part of a more resilient, equitable, efficient and enjoyable bread system?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:11):**  How can we help Abigail stock their local takeaways with hardo bread baked with Brixton  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:15):**  windmill flour? How can we follow Rosie Benson's lead and help people to understand that if  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:22):**  they care about good bread, they also have to care about healthy soil? And how can we  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:28):**  join with Rosie Gray in making sure that we celebrate everyone involved in making our  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:33):**  bread and that we listen to what they have to say?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:40):**  In the next episode, we head to the West Midlands to hear how the pandemic has impacted community  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:46):**  growing, identity and mental health with a focus on communities of African and Caribbean  
**[0:37:52-0:38:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:37:52):**  heritage.

**[0:38:59-0:39:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:38:59):**  I have a very distinct memory of I had a Thomas the Tank Engine egg cup. My mom would make  
**[0:39:08-0:39:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:39:08):**  me runny soft boiled eggs and I'd have eggs and soldiers and she'd cut my toast. Yeah,  
**[0:39:18-0:39:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-4-whole-meal#t=0:39:18):**  that's my earliest memory.

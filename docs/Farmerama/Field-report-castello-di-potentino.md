**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:00):**  From time to time we get in a story that deserves a bit more attention than we're able to give  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:05):**  on our regular monthly episode.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:07):**  And here's one of those.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:08):**  A field report from Farmerama reporter Camilla Williamson at Castello di Portentino, a small  
**[0:00:15-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:15):**  scale sustainable vineyard in Italy.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:31):**  I am in... this is like central Tuscany, right?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:36):**  Central Tuscany.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:37):**  I'm about to pick the grapes tomorrow to make some delicious wine.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:47):**  My name is Charlotte Horton.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:49):**  I am English, but I've been living initially for 26 years and discovered that I had an  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:00:57):**  extraordinary passion for wine making.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:00):**  I learned wine making off the local people 25 years ago and that experience has been  
**[0:01:08-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:08):**  informing the way that I make wine and I treat the vines ever since then.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:16):**  My name is Andy Bullard.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:18):**  Full name is Michael Andrew Bullard II.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:22):**  Today we took samples from each row from the vineyards, the ones that we're going to harvest,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:30):**  and just samples being one from the top, middle and bottom about every 10 feet.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:37):**  And those were taken to some lab and were tested, I think, for sugar content and such  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:44):**  and the results that came back I heard were very good.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:49):**  It's a technique that's based on observation and really using very, very natural treatment  
**[0:01:57-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:01:57):**  of the vines and responding to the plants and the particular microclimate that we have.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:06):**  We have found a whole series of Etruscan wine making stones down the valley which attest  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:13):**  to probably continuous tradition of wine making for about 3,000 years.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:20):**  So I'm very proud to be continuing that extremely important tradition.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:29):**  Next we get the grapes from the vines.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:31):**  Tomorrow we're supposed to be out there ready to go at 7, sun up, sun down.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:39):**  The Castello di Potentino has a very unique microclimate.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:44):**  We are in a valley under one of the highest mountains in Tuscany that used to be a volcano.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:50):**  So we have mixed volcanic soil.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:51):**  We have a lot of aquifers under the soil and we have extreme changes in temperature, what  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:02:59):**  they call diurnal temperature, so from day to night.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:04):**  So we have very hot dry air coming in from the coast during the day, very cold air coming  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:09):**  off the mountain at night.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:11):**  These are perfect conditions for the growth of fruit and in fact this valley which is  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:16):**  known as the golden basin in the area, the Concadoro, is very fertile and full of fruit  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:23):**  trees, olive trees, cherry trees, apple, pear, all sorts of things and obviously vine.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:32):**  We have three different varieties of grape in our vineyard.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:37):**  All three varieties are extremely sensitive to their particular environments.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:44):**  So they have a particular quality or a characteristic but they very much reflect or mirror the microclimate  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:52):**  or what they call in France the terroir of where they are.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:03:58):**  So I think plants definitely have an intelligence.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:02):**  Plants have a different type of intelligence and not able to recognize the intelligence  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:07):**  of plants sadly.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:10):**  So plants often get quite badly treated and what I'm interested in is providing a very  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:19):**  good situation for the plants because they will thrive and they will produce something  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:26):**  that is natural.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:30):**  It's sustainable and so that's also very important in how you consider what you're planting and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:35):**  where is the sustainability not only in the sustainability of the plant's life but also  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:44):**  in the sustainability of the taste.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:47):**  I believe that you can actually taste in wines or food when they are produced from plants  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:54):**  that are happy and sustainable in their own environment.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:04:59):**  So we don't add a lot of chemicals to the wine, we don't add a lot of fertilizers to  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:05):**  the soil and we don't irrigate.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:08):**  These are things that will become less sustainable.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:12):**  The use of pesticides and fungicides and treatments for plants in order to produce food or wine  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:20):**  is becoming a really problematic issue.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:23):**  I think that people and plants should be where they can survive without making too much of  
**[0:05:31-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:31):**  an effort.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:40):**  Obviously we have a lot of young volunteers who come and learn about how we make wine.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:47):**  In the last month it's been a very busy time, we've been preparing the vines for harvest.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:53):**  Obviously then we've been actually making wine, so that involves picking the grapes  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:05:58):**  and processing them in the winery.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:03):**  My name is Canilla and I'm staying in Portantino for a few weeks volunteering.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:10):**  Hi my name is Santiago, I come from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:15):**  Today was the first day of harvesting one of the grapes, the Pinot Noir.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:21):**  We put the gloves on and cut the grapes without leaves, put them in crates and then we went  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:31):**  through the vines with the tractor, stacking them all up in the tractor to then take them  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:37):**  up to the back of the castle where they have all the wine making machines and stuff.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:41):**  We were up pretty early, like 6am and had to be out on the fields, the moon was still  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:46):**  up which was lovely.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:47):**  It was quite cool, it was fun, there was about 16 of us doing it.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:52):**  They look pretty tasty, pretty ripe, it looks like it's going to be a good harvest.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:06:57):**  And then we threw them all in a machine that de-steams the grapes.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:03):**  So from one end comes all the leaves and steams and stuff, and on the other end of the machine  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:11):**  with a pressured hose comes out all the grapes, the skin and the juices and everything.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:18):**  And it was quite relieving to get out of the sun by that point, it was about 12.30.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:22):**  We did another hour in the vat passing down a chain of these massive buckets of squashed  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:27):**  grapes and the smell was really strong and on one side you've got all of the barrels  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:32):**  that just had wine in for like a year or so, then on the other side you've got all these  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:36):**  huge empty vats which echo quite a lot and obviously I think they've been scrubbed down  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:41):**  by people who have volunteered before us over the last few months.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:46):**  Skins and juices go into big barrels of wood, I don't know which wood really, and apparently  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:52):**  they stay there for 2 or 3 weeks where they ferment.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:07:57):**  It's a very sweet smell, as you start messing up and grapes explode in your fingers and  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:07):**  they get all over the place, your t-shirt and everything, and you can smell the sweetness  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:11):**  in the air, the sugar from the fruits.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:15):**  So we're all pretty tired, our feet are pretty sore, we've got a few more hours to do today  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:19):**  and then I think we'll go out and finish the last few rows tomorrow morning.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:26):**  There's a bit of a deadline because as the sun goes up the grapes get too warm and then  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:30):**  that's no good apparently.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:33):**  So you start quite slowly, taking your time with each bunch of grapes and then you start  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:40):**  to sweat and you feel you have to hurry up, but it's good fun.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:47):**  After the fermentation process is over, all the volunteers have been helping to take the  
**[0:08:53-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:08:53):**  grape skins off the liquid, the liquid is then racked off and put into barrels to age.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:03):**  We are stamping out the remaining juice left in the grape skins that have been fermenting  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:07):**  over the past 2 weeks I believe.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:10):**  Sarah is lucky enough to be in the thing stamping out, but there's a massive tub on the floor  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:16):**  with a pump and she's squeezing out all the juice.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:19):**  And then people are getting a bit drunk of the fumes in the vat from the fermenting grape  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:25):**  skins and then after this process the grape skins will be, the smell is overpowering.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:30):**  I mean if you stick your head into the vat where all the remaining grape skins are, it's  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:34):**  just alcohol, alcohol, alcohol and that's why you get a bit light headed very fast.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:38):**  Yeah, it's a very sweet smell.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:41):**  So I think generally everyone who's been here has had quite a good understanding of how  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:09:55):**  much work it takes to run a small business and as a small producer, especially if you're  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:01):**  using no machinery.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:03):**  So most of the work is done by hand in vineyards because it makes a difference to the plant.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:10):**  If you see plants that are picked by machines, it's a very traumatic thing to see.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:17):**  There's a technical reason why it's not good for the plants because it traumatises and  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:22):**  damages the plants, but it also damages the quality of the production because you can  
**[0:10:29-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:29):**  get grapes that are maybe hit or damaged and the juice will come out in the back of the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:40):**  truck and that can mean that you can have fermentations, uncontrolled fermentations  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:47):**  starting in places where you don't want that to happen.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:52):**  So it's actually, not only is it traumatic for the plant, but it's actually bad for the  
**[0:10:56-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:10:56):**  production as well.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:11:11):**  Thanks to Charlotte, Andy, Santiago, Liam, Sarah and Caroline for their time.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:11:16):**  And extra special thanks to Camilla for her field report.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-castello-di-potentino#t=0:11:20):**  The regular Farmerama will be back, as ever, on the third Sunday of the month.

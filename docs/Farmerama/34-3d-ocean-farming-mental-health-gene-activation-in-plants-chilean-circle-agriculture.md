### Farmerama  (Sun, 27 May 2018 10:09:18)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to episode 34 of Farmerama.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:07):**  This month we first hear from a self-confessed non-environmentalist about an ocean-based  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:12):**  farming solution that might inadvertently be saving the environment, as well as providing  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:17):**  a simple, new and sensible option for people wanting to make a living from the sea.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:23):**  In Northern Ireland we get stuck into the very important issue of mental health in farming.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:29):**  We get the lowdown on plants activating genes and how this relates to seed saving.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:34):**  And we end with a farmer in the remote south of Chile telling us about the importance of  
**[0:00:39-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:39):**  community and how we can contribute to what he calls circle agriculture.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:00:54):**  Bren Smith is Executive Director and Co-Founder of Greenwave, a fisherman-run organisation  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:01):**  focused on 3D ocean farming of kelp.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:04):**  Their polyculture vertical farming system grows a mix of seaweeds and shellfish that  
**[0:01:08-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:08):**  requires zero inputs while sequestering carbon and rebuilding reef ecosystems.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:23):**  So my name is Bren Smith, I'm owner of Thimble Island Ocean Farm and I'm a 3D ocean farmer.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:30):**  So think of polyculture out to sea.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:33):**  You know I was born and raised up in Newfoundland, Canada and dropped out of high school when  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:38):**  I was 14 and headed out to become a commercial fisherman.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:42):**  I fished you know Gloucester, Graham Banks, George's Banks, Tuna, Lobster and then I headed  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:47):**  to the Bering Sea where I fished cod and crab.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:50):**  You know that was the height of industrialised fishing, it's what we know, it was ecologically  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:01:57):**  unsustainable and it was doomed in terms of creating a good living for those of us that  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:04):**  want to spend our lives on the ocean.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:07):**  So then I went to the aquaculture farms, the salmon farms to try that because that was  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:12):**  supposed to be the answer to overfishing but instead it was still an industrial model  
**[0:02:18-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:18):**  of polluting, of not protecting and caretaking for our oceans and creating a really new vibrant  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:27):**  food supply.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:28):**  So I left sort of disillusioned from the aquaculture sector and then I headed and remade myself  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:34):**  as at the beginning an oyster farmer down in Long Island Sound and that was about 15  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:40):**  years ago and that was the start of all this.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:43):**  You know I'm not really an environmentalist, I grew up supporting the seal hunts as a kid,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:49):**  this was a way of life and I really think of the ocean as a place that I can die on  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:02:56):**  my boat one day, I can have a self-directed life, I can have the pride of helping feed  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:01):**  my country, I can have something to pass on to my kids.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:05):**  The interesting thing is that we're in a time where the choice between jobs and economic  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:12):**  development and ecological restoration, it's not a choice, it's a false choice that we  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:20):**  have to pick one or the other.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:22):**  Like I need to help restore the seas in order to make a living.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:26):**  Even though I'm not a foodie, you know I eat at gas stations and McDonald's and stuff like  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:30):**  that, I'm just a working class kid and I still love the fish switch sandwich and I don't  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:34):**  comment this from an environmental perspective, it's now a tent, this food farming sector  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:42):**  sort of takes all types and I think we're gathering around this common vision of restoration,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:48):**  of feeding local communities and really trying to figure out what would a new sort of climate  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:54):**  farming and climate cuisine look like in the next 50 years.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:03:59):**  You know why are we growing around a wild industrial palette?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:03):**  Like we're trying to grow salmons and tunas, things that people want to eat based on originally  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:09):**  a wild fishery and why aren't we asking the oceans, what does it make sense to grow?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:13):**  You know imagine an underwater garden and what we have is hurricane proof anchors on  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:20):**  the sort of edges of the farm and then just some simple rope scaffolding down below and  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:26):**  from there we grow all sorts of different species.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:29):**  We grow seaweeds and shellfish, so we have kelps, we've got gracilarias, we have oysters,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:35):**  scallops, mussels, clams, we even harvest salt from those grounds and the way we pick  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:42):**  the species is we only do zero input species because the brilliant thing about the ocean  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:46):**  is two things.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:47):**  One is we don't really have to fight gravity, so we're able to build these very simple architectures  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:53):**  under the ocean and they're all these creatures we don't have to feed, so no freshwater, no  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:04:57):**  feed, no fertilizer and of course no land making it the most sustainable food on the  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:03):**  planet.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:04):**  That's one of the unique things about the farming system we've all come up with is that  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:08):**  it's highly replicable and it takes minimal capital costs.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:12):**  Think of it as sort of the nail salon model of the ocean.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:15):**  If you have 20 acres and a boat and $20,000 you can start up your own farm and that's  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:20):**  been the key to replication, kind of these simple affordable designs so everyday regular  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:27):**  people like me can do this.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:31):**  What's interesting on the commercial side is we've started with shellfish and then particularly  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:37):**  a sugar kelp and it's because it's one of the fastest growing plants on earth, it goes  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:43):**  in post hurricane season, we're able to just grow huge quantities in short periods of time  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:49):**  and it's a winter crop so it's off season for a lot of fishermen which is good.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:55):**  But I see that just as the beginning.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:05:58):**  There are thousands of edible plants in the ocean, hundreds of kinds of shellfish.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:02):**  There is something we can grow all over the globe.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:06):**  So kelp is sort of for us the gateway drug in the beginning of this whole new polyculture  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:13):**  regime that we can go out and imagine being a chef and finding out there are corns, arugulas,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:19):**  tomatoes, kales that you've never seen before, you've never tasted before.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:23):**  What we have is Green Wave which is a non-profit and that's meant to really train the new generation  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:29):**  of ocean farmers.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:30):**  And we have requests to start farms in every coastal state in North America and 20 countries  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:35):**  around the world.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:36):**  I think we have over 100 farmers in England alone that want to start their own farms.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:41):**  The demand is just huge.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:44):**  A lot of actually young land-based farmers, men and women who can't afford land out in  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:51):**  the water, for us it's only $50 an acre a year.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:54):**  So they're able to come in and reimagine themselves as ocean farmers.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:06:59):**  So there's something we can grow everywhere.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:01):**  Some places it'll take some initial research in order to figure out what's economically  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:07):**  viable and what's delicious.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:09):**  It basically you put up $20,000 of initial startup costs.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:16):**  So about $35,000 of fixed costs year to year to keep the farm going.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:22):**  Because you can do anywhere from 10 to 20 tons of seaweed per acre, we're actually able  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:30):**  to make it profitable.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:31):**  Generally it's two full-time jobs, five to seven part-time jobs during intense seasonal  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:38):**  work and it's a net for the farmer between $100,000 and $150,000.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:45):**  It's just the crops because we don't have to feed them.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:48):**  It's cheap.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:49):**  It's just rope, some anchors and picking the right crops, it really shifts the economics  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:55):**  of it.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:07:58):**  Now another check-in with Jonny Hansen at Jubilee Farm in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:04):**  Here Jonny is speaking to his wife Paula, a fellow Jubilee director.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:09):**  She is a trainee counsellor and the two of them discuss the intersection of mental health,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:14):**  well-being and farming.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:16):**  There is a bit of wind noise in this recording so we apologize for that.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:20):**  One of the things that we're seeking to set up at Jubilee Farm is a care farming program  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:25):**  and care farming works on the premise that time spent on a farm working with people,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:30):**  animals, plants and the soil is good for us, good for body, good for mind and good for  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:37):**  souls.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:38):**  But if care farming uses farming to take care of vulnerable groups in society, including  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:43):**  those with mental health problems, what about taking care of farmers themselves, particularly  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:49):**  with regards to their mental health and well-being?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:53):**  Well to answer that question this month I'm joined by Paula Hansen who is my fellow Jubilee  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:08:59):**  co-founder, director and better half but she's also a trainee counsellor.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:05):**  And Paula and I are no stranger to mental health problems.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:10):**  Paula has had ME for 15 years and both of us have faced the challenges, the mental health  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:15):**  challenges in particular, of dealing and coping with long-term chronic illness.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:23):**  So Paula, what are some of the challenges facing mental health amongst farmers but also  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:30):**  in farming communities and families?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:33):**  Hi, thanks Jonny.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:36):**  Yes I think as a society we're beginning to become more aware of the importance of our  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:40):**  mental health and how that impacts our lives but there seems to be a lag in the agricultural  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:46):**  sector.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:47):**  In a recent study the Office for National Statistics found that more than one agricultural  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:53):**  worker a week in the UK dies by suicide and the levels of depression seem to be increasing  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:09:59):**  in the sector also.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:01):**  In fact they went on to say that figures show that the risk to suicide among agricultural  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:06):**  roles such as harvesting crops and rearing animals are almost twice the national average  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:11):**  in the UK and I just feel that this is just unacceptable and we really need to start having  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:17):**  more dialogue about what's going on.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:20):**  So I think one of the, some of the problems around this are that there seems to still  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:24):**  be a stigma around mental health and talking about it within our agricultural communities  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:31):**  which further increases our isolation.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:33):**  And even by the nature of the work, working anti-social hours, often working alone and  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:38):**  it's hard arduous physical work often also which we also recognise that our physical  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:45):**  well-being impacts our mental health also.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:47):**  But there are also very real financial stresses and pressures on farming communities whether  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:10:53):**  it be the increase in feed or fuel prices or supermarket prices affecting it or the  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:00):**  weather.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:01):**  So what can you add to the overwhelming feeling of stress that our farmers and farming families  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:05):**  are under at the moment?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:10):**  Finding farming stressful is something we've had experience of recently, setting up Jubilee  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:15):**  Farm and particularly in the last few months the lease we were seeking on our first choice  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:20):**  site that we've been working towards for a number of years has fallen through unexpectedly  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:25):**  and we've been scrambling to find an alternative site at short notice and that has proved to  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:30):**  be phenomenally stressful at times.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:33):**  So Paula based on that recent lived experience in the Hanson household but also your practice  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:38):**  as a counsellor, what are some of the solutions then to the mental health crisis in farming?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:46):**  Since I've mentioned suicide I think it's really important that I just highlight that  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:51):**  if you are in that very low point that there are organisations like Lifeline and the Smartens  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:11:57):**  that you can contact with their helplines on a 24-7 basis and it's really important  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:02):**  to do that but equally just finding someone and tell them how you're feeling and being  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:07):**  open about where you're at.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:09):**  You can also visit your GP because your mental health really and truly matters but simple  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:15):**  things that we can all do to improve our wellbeing and lower our levels of depression can be  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:21):**  just taking time, even 30 minutes a day of self-care and that can be simple like going  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:27):**  for a walk or doing something that makes you feel good about yourself but there are also  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:32):**  other organisations and charities like in the UK we have Farming Community Network and  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:37):**  in Northern Ireland we have the Rural Support Initiative that help support farmers and farming  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:41):**  communities whether it be through financial advice or support or linking them in with  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:47):**  places where they can help their mental health.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:50):**  So yes, it's all about being real and talking more about how you're feeling.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:55):**  There's lots of food for thought Paula there for all of us as we seek to improve mental  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:12:59):**  health in farming communities and just on a personal note from Jubilee Farm we've found  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:04):**  that if life gives you lemons then make lemonade and as a result of having to move from our  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:10):**  site this summer we hope to rent and then buy via Community Shares the first community  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:15):**  owned farm in Northern Ireland so do stay tuned to Farmerama in future episodes for  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:20):**  more news on that.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:23):**  And so finally from Paula and myself at Jubilee Farm this month we're wishing you good mental  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:29):**  health or as we say in Irish, sláinte.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:33):**  This is a subject we've wanted to cover for a long time so thank you to Paula and Johnny  
**[0:13:39-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:39):**  for what I think is a quite important report.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:52):**  We hope you enjoy listening to Farmerama as much as we enjoy making it.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:13:56):**  A lot of work goes into each episode so we're always really grateful for support.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:01):**  If you're interested in becoming a supporter or if you know someone you think might be  
**[0:14:06-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:06):**  interested please do get in touch with us through our website Farmerama.co.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:25):**  Marco Bencien farms with his family at Fundo Laguna Blanca in the 8th region in Chile.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:32):**  He lives under the watch of two volcanoes, one still active.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:37):**  The landscape is incredibly lush, a real feast for the eyes.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:41):**  Marco is a regenerative farmer working with permaculture, fostering the native forests  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:47):**  and building soils with animals.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:49):**  This sanctuary is something Marco wants to share and here he tells us about the importance  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:54):**  of community and opportunities to get involved.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:14:58):**  My name is Marco Bencien, 33 years old, farmer from Germany Cologne and now we stay here  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:06):**  in Fundo Laguna Blanca in the south of Chile in the 9th region, Araucania.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:12):**  We are on 1000 meters above sea level and from 106 kilometers from the next town, Timuco.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:21):**  For me farming here is a lifestyle and so for me it's a big big life quality to have  
**[0:15:28-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:28):**  trees in front of my window, cows grazing and to see what I did in the last 10 years  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:38):**  here because it's not the same to come into some place and have a lot of money perhaps  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:45):**  and do everything with machines or other companies or people.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:48):**  If you turn around every stone and you know what you did, there is some kind of peace  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:15:54):**  in you because you made where you are living now.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:00):**  For me it's very important that every morning when I stand up I don't think in earning money  
**[0:16:05-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:05):**  or going forward so fast or have so much success is a part of life too but I'm thinking also  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:14):**  I love what I do every day and there are some days, bad days or some holds or downs, I don't  
**[0:16:21-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:21):**  know how we can call it but in the most situations I love what I do and I want to do it and I  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:30):**  have some kind of identification with it and I hope so there are much more people to have  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:35):**  this situation because I know a lot of people working in these places only for their salary  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:41):**  and to get forward with what they are doing with their family.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:48):**  Today we don't see so much because we are in the clouds but we are situated here in  
**[0:16:53-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:16:53):**  our lodge where we have about 25 beds or about 10 or 12 rooms.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:01):**  I came here 10 years ago with my family with a tent, with some work tools, a generator  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:08):**  and built the first house to have a base and then with years we built a water system, a  
**[0:17:15-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:15):**  road system, some houses, some barns to have some base for the developing of this sustainable  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:25):**  project.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:28):**  For me it was very important because in Germany we are connected with the civilisation and  
**[0:17:33-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:33):**  infrastructure with light and water and everything and today I know what it means to have one  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:41):**  liter of water or to have power in the house to have light and it was for me personally  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:49):**  a very very good experience to learn about our resources.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:17:54):**  What we also do in this moment is the next step is to build some soils between our native  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:02):**  forests where we want to make some future forests.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:06):**  So we don't plant like it's normally in Chile, Eucalyptus and Pinot, we only plant native  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:12):**  trees.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:17):**  And so we think in 10 or 15 years we can have more water here like it was 100 years before  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:26):**  there will come back the animals and between these forests we clear some fields where we  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:32):**  have some deadwood and bamboo and stones to have some fields for our animals and our agriculture  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:41):**  in the same way as they are helping us like fire cuts.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:45):**  The farmers from organic or traditional, I don't want to make there a difference, all  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:18:54):**  what we are working with the soil and we are working with animals and we are working for  
**[0:19:01-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:01):**  this food system in this world, we have to build a bigger community.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:09):**  My opinion is organic farming but I can understand also people who can change so fast so I think  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:17):**  it's very important that we have more communication and see what are our results and what is my  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:24):**  wish in it, there are much more connection between the people and not only frustration  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:31):**  because there is a big industry or there is a client who don't want to buy or everything,  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:36):**  my wish is much more communication, much more community between the farmers and so I think  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:43):**  we have a good way for the future.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:46):**  Circle agriculture for me is a little bit like the old way but in a modern way too and  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:52):**  so I mean to have everything what normally a farm had 50 years ago, 100 years ago like  
**[0:19:59-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:19:59):**  we have horses, pigs, sheep, goats, cows, we seed oats, we have a project with quinoa,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:11):**  we have birds with eggs, we have a sale shop and we have fruits, vegetables and so what  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:25):**  I mean with circle agriculture is that we can have everything but in every area we have  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:30):**  another person to concentrate on it.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:33):**  What we need or what I want to do is like community farming so the idea is we have some  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:39):**  model in Germany called Change Campo, it's a cooperative, what the idea is that we have  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:46):**  some people working together, have their own spaces like with the animals or with the fields  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:20:53):**  or the forest or everything, in the same moment they are owner of the thing because they can  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:01):**  be part of it and in another way they work in their area where they want to work.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:08):**  So we can do some circle agriculture, we can do a lot of things but we have in every work  
**[0:21:16-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:16):**  space another person who is a specialist what I can say and then we can concentrate us on  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:25):**  these different things and can something great together.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:29):**  So everybody who is interested to speak about these options can contact me.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:46):**  We first heard from Joel Williams of Integrated Soils back in episode 28 where he told us  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:52):**  how he fell in love with soil.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:54):**  We caught up with Joel again at last month's Future of UK Farming conference put on by  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:21:59):**  the Sustainable Food Trust.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:01):**  Here's Joel to fill us in on how plants turn on certain genes, how this relates to seed  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:06):**  saving and just how important mycorrhizae are as a plant's communication channel.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:11):**  My name is Joel Williams from Integrated Soils and I am an educator particularly around soil  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:18):**  health and I do some consulting and advisory work for farmers but I'm mostly involved in  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:23):**  extension and sharing of information and knowledge.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:26):**  Plants are an expression of their environment, the soil's chemical, physical and biological  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:32):**  characteristics and the other climatic and weather factors.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:37):**  All of those factors are triggers that stimulate the expression of certain genes that up or  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:43):**  down regulate certain genes.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:45):**  Therefore the plant is a product of its environment and the more that plant or as that plant grows  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:52):**  through that season it's turning on the certain genes that it requires to survive that environment  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:22:58):**  based on maybe the pathogen loads, insects, other temperature triggers, etc.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:03):**  And so therefore the plant turns on all of those genes that it requires during that growing  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:07):**  season and when the plant then moves into reproduction and starts to produce seed it  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:13):**  is sending those, it is carrying on those genes into the seed in a more up-regulated  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:19):**  state you could say so that when the future progeny of that plant, when that seed germinates  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:27):**  that plant will have those genes in a more activated state which then means that that  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:32):**  future child of the plant is in a way more adapt to that environment because it's already  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:38):**  been told what genes you need to activate straight away and therefore that future plant,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:43):**  the future child is very adapt to that environment.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:47):**  And therefore this is one of the reasons that farmers definitely should be saving seed a  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:51):**  lot more because as we're now discovering as we open up this vast world of the soil  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:23:57):**  microbiome and link that to the plant genome and then all of these gene to gene conversations  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:03):**  that are happening between plants and microbes we are understanding that these triggers and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:10):**  these nuances are actually extremely infinite and they are unique to each and every different  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:17):**  soil type.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:18):**  So by growing your plants, by saving your seeds grown in your soils you are selecting  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:23):**  and carrying on the genes that those plants require specifically in relation to your very  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:28):**  ultra-local soil type and that's the reason that farmers should be saving more and more  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:33):**  seed and doing that year after year and actually strengthening and selecting for the genes  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:38):**  that are required in their future varieties and breeds etc.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:43):**  We now are uncovering that plants absolutely communicate, not only do they share resources  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:47):**  through mycorrhizal fungi, they absolutely also communicate to each other and there's  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:53):**  quite a well-known study that was done with tomatoes and it would grow some tomatoes side  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:24:58):**  by side in the same soil but the tomato plants were enclosed in a bubble, in a barrier that  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:05):**  therefore meant that the tomatoes were not sharing airspace but however under the soil  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:10):**  their roots were indeed in contact with each other.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:14):**  And we know that plants release all sorts of volatile stress compounds, signaling molecules  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:19):**  that they can communicate through the air through those volatile compounds but the point  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:23):**  of putting that barrier, that little glass, the bubble over the tomatoes meant that we  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:28):**  restricted that sharing of airspace.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:31):**  And then what we did, what the researchers did to the half of the treatment was infected  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:36):**  with blight, with tomato blight and they found that the neighbouring tomato plant was then  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:44):**  it turned on its immune system, it activated specifically six genes that are associated  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:49):**  with the defence systems of the plant and they determined that actually it was the stressed  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:55):**  and infected plant that was sending a signaling molecule down to the root system, giving that  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:25:59):**  to the mycorrhizal fungi, the mycorrhizal fungi was carrying that through the soil and  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:03):**  then passing that on to the other tomato plant to then which turned on its immune system.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:10):**  So plants we now know absolutely can not only communicate through the air but also communicate  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:15):**  through the mycorrhizal fungal bridge and it emphasises therefore how important that  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:20):**  mycorrhizal bridge is when it's not there, if we didn't have mycorrhizal fungi there  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:25):**  of course those tomatoes would not have been able to carry that message across.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:30):**  One of the other interesting things we also have identified is that plants can pass on  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:36):**  immunity to their progeny through that seed when they are exposed to and challenged by,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:42):**  particularly by pathogens, so if a plant is exposed to a pathogen it receives that signal,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:47):**  that trigger that the pathogen is there, the plant will turn on its immune system to fight  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:52):**  off that pathogen and in doing that it can also then transfer immunity into the seed  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:26:59):**  for the future progeny that actually then has an inherent and inbuilt immunity already  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:07):**  in it.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:08):**  The research has shown that that is only passed on for one generation, it's not that then  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:12):**  that child can pass it on to its next one, so that next child would have to then be exposed  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:17):**  to that pathogen again to then carry that across but nonetheless it does add to that  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:23):**  point we were discussing earlier about seeds transferring, plants transferring the right  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:28):**  genes required for their environments into their seeds and so even on that point from  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:34):**  disease pressure and disease management it's a really important reason why farmers should  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:41):**  be saving their seed.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-episode-34#t=0:27:44):**  Thanks Joel, you can also tune into our short this month to hear from Pasture for Life farmer

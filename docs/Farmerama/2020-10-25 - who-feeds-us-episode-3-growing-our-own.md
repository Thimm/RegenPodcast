## "Who feeds us?" Episode 3: Growing our own  
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:00):**  Who Feeds Us? From Farmerama Episode 3 Growing Our Own  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:11):**  As lockdown came into effect and we were faced with queuing for hours to buy fruit and veg  
**[0:00:15-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:15):**  from supermarkets, the idea of growing your own took on a new significance. In towns and  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:22):**  cities across the UK, those of us lucky enough to have gardens or balconies, even if we'd  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:28):**  never grown anything before, suddenly we were on the hunt for compost, tools and seeds.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:35):**  Many of us discovered, perhaps for the first time, the joy of eating freshly picked, homegrown  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:41):**  fruit and veg. It's a joy that you just don't get when you bite into something that's  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:46):**  been harvested unripe on the other side of the world, flown across oceans to be processed  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:51):**  somewhere else, then eventually picked up from a chiller here in the UK, perhaps weeks  
**[0:00:56-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:00:56):**  later. But as we'll hear, individual self-reliance has its limits. Shared growing spaces like  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:05):**  allotments and community gardens show us what can be achieved when we come together to pool  
**[0:01:11-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:11):**  resources, support each other and work collectively towards true food security. Let's meet some  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:18):**  of the people who are doing just that.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:23):**  My name is Astrid. I live in Birmingham in an area called Shardend, which is east of  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:29):**  Birmingham near Solihull. I live in a block of flats. We have two kids together, a soon  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:34):**  to be four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. It has been a very challenging time,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:41):**  I guess, for everybody. We can't rely uniquely on supermarkets. It's not possible. Look at  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:47):**  what happened. We're relying on food that is coming from abroad. Our health and our  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:01:53):**  happiness is dependent on all of that. We can't live like that. People ended up, you  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:00):**  know, realising what is essential to us. So food is priority in my house. Feed yourself  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:06):**  well. So I mean, no chemicals, none of that. But like everyone, I don't always have the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:12):**  budget to be able to spend as much money as I lack on food. What can I do? I want to be  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:18):**  more eco-friendly and eat better and feel better with myself and help uplift my community  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:24):**  in a more healthy way. But I can't grow food in my flat. It's not possible. I could get  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:30):**  an allotment, but I don't think I have the energy between my kids, work and everything.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:35):**  It's fighting this constant, you know, inner battle. And it's definitely something that  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:40):**  has been making me unhappy and destroying me inside. With what I like to do, how I like  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:45):**  to live, but also how can I live like that without living like in the countryside? I  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:52):**  truly believe that you can produce your own food while still enjoying living in a city.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:02:59):**  So how do we do that? So I'm Neville Portis. I'm a land worker and allotment here in the  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:08):**  Midlands just north of Birmingham. Neville is part of No Diggity Gardens, a site for  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:13):**  community growing, composting and learning. Since COVID and since the pandemic, the discussions  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:20):**  have really been what can we do? How can we help ourselves? How can we help our communities?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:26):**  Prior to that, it really was a self-sufficient drive for me and my family. So the dream would  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:31):**  be to move to a more rural setting and to set up some sort of homestead. But when the  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:37):**  pandemic hit, we looked at the amount of people that we were surrounded by in Birmingham.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:42):**  And of course, all the people around you that you care for and that you're connected with.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:46):**  It just seemed completely pointless to be the guy on the hill with a few chickens and  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:50):**  some vegetables if everybody else can't do a similar thing or the same thing. So yeah,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:03:56):**  a total change really from looking inwards to trying to provide something that everyone  
**[0:04:01-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:01):**  can use. My name is Dee Woods and I am a food actionist and campaigner for Good Food for  
**[0:04:13-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:13):**  All. Most of my work is based at Granville Community Kitchen, a community-led food hub  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:22):**  in South Kilburn, North West London. So even though we've been doing food aid, using surplus  
**[0:04:30-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:30):**  from the supermarket system, our garden space actually preceded the community kitchen. Initially  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:39):**  with just a couple raised beds and that has developed over the years to allotments on  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:48):**  a nearby estate. We've continued to grow throughout COVID. It's been a source of fresh  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:04:55):**  vegetables for a lot of people, not just food, but comfort as well, just to come and sit  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:02):**  in the garden and just enjoy it. When you taste something that's been grown with our  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:10):**  very ecological methods, that's grown in season and hasn't been flown in and in cold storage  
**[0:05:17-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:17):**  for months. I think that just wakes people up and people have been rediscovering their  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:26):**  connection to land and to growing and nature. It's intensified because of COVID that people  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:34):**  just want to connect. To go back a bit more to where I live, so in Shardons, we have a  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:42):**  little space where we have a church, a library, and just at the back of it, there's this pathway  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:49):**  where everybody is constantly passing through, either to go to the park or to go to the community  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:05:54):**  centre. It's a great spot, but there's nothing going on there. The space at the moment, we've  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:00):**  had already five semi-raised beds, two metres by two metres, big squares. The intention  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:06):**  with it was probably to grow something, but there was nothing done with it. So I've started  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:12):**  with talking to people around me. I'm on a couple of groups on Facebook and on WhatsApp  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:19):**  and they're doing urban farming. I myself am not growing anything beside my herbs, but  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:23):**  just seeing all those people doing those different things has inspired me finding a way of growing  
**[0:06:28-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:28):**  foods in the local area. Now Diggity runs across two local authority sites in the Walsall borough,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:38):**  and we're currently looking after six allotment plots. Over that, we have mini market garden  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:43):**  style plots, which are production spaces, and then we have an educational kitchen space,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:49):**  an apiary, a worm farm, a polytunnel, some chickens, and accessible gardens. It was going  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:06:57):**  to be a two, three year project of putting these bits of infrastructure in place, but  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:02):**  when the virus came, it sort of gave us the kick up the backside to get it all done. So  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:07):**  that's all been done this season. When you get onto the allotments themselves, you can  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:11):**  see that there's a lot of unused space. So mediating with the management on the plots,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:17):**  it's quite easy to sort of make better use of the land, carve out a little niche. I mean,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:23):**  that's my experience. Being on allotments, I can see that maybe it's not the safest,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:30):**  or most inviting place for everybody. So that's become a part of No Diggity's mission of making  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:36):**  that happen and making it be a safer place for people of colour and women. So the plan  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:42):**  is to grow food. The plan is to start with those five square raised beds, and we've been  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:50):**  looking at how we can design the space around the people and what they need. There is no  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:07:57):**  point starting this great idea without involving the local people. So that was our first step,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:05):**  I suppose, as a part of that move from self-sufficiency to community resilience, it becomes apparent  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:12):**  that the disconnection from nature and our food in general is really, really an issue  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:19):**  and a problem. But obviously it's not a hard thing to do. Growing food is more about just  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:25):**  doing it and watching and doing it again and watching. So yeah, just encouragement more  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:30):**  than anything. If there's any carrots to be pulled, the kids get to do that. If there's  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:34):**  any potatoes to be dug up, the kids will do that. The adults will get into making compost  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:39):**  or a bit of weeding or a bit of fermenting, or we've got apple day coming up, so it's  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:45):**  going to be a lot of apple juice. There's seed sowing, or at this time of the year we're  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:51):**  doing a lot of seed saving. It just seems more and more and more important. Again, through  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:08:56):**  COVID, all the seed banks, all the seed companies were generally cleared out. Under lockdown,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:03):**  all seed companies across the country were completely overwhelmed. In part, it was a  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:07):**  600% increase in week-on-week demand compared to last year. My name is Helena Schultz. I  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:14):**  am one of the directors of the London Freedom Seed Bank and regional coordinator for the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:20):**  South East of England for the Seed Sovereignty Program of the UK and Ireland. I guess we're  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:25):**  in an interesting time now where we've got loads of people growing their own veg at home,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:31):**  which is great, and we want to encourage them now to get on board with seed saving. That  
**[0:09:37-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:37):**  cycle of storing seed either for the coming year or for exchange and distribution is as  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:45):**  old as agriculture itself, and I think it's just that we've become used to a system where  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:09:52):**  seed can be patented or genetically modified or owned, and accordingly needs to be repurchased  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:00):**  the next year, which leaves so many growers and farmers across the world in vicious chains  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:06):**  of dependency. And so at the Seed Sovereignty Program, we work on the regional level to  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:13):**  train experienced growers who are wanting to produce and sell seed, and we also work  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:19):**  with community groups to support them in maintaining community seed collections. And you know,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:26):**  it's another one, just get in and start, but as soon as you start, that snowballs in itself.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:31):**  So we've got a small seed bank running, which the allotments themselves have taken on as  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:36):**  a project. Chard and beetroot pak choi and Spanish radish and all sorts of stuff, tomatoes,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:44):**  cucumbers. So yeah, I mean, it's thinking a couple of seasons ahead when it comes to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:47):**  seed saving, but it's very rewarding. It's really rewarding work.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:53):**  Local varieties are far better adapted to local conditions such as soil quality and  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:10:58):**  climate and so also more resilient. As a species, we depend on seeds. To grow food, we need  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:06):**  seeds and seeds are pretty amazing. Plant a single tiny tomato seed, for example, and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:13):**  a few months later, you'll be able to harvest hundreds of seeds from the tomatoes that one  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:18):**  plant produces. Seeds are the gift that keeps on giving, or at least some types of seeds  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:25):**  are. So I guess an important distinction is between open pollinated seed and F1 hybrids.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:31):**  And F1 hybrid seeds are the result of cross pollination between two parent plants for  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:37):**  desirable traits. So one example might be a particularly delicious tomato crossed with  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:42):**  another one, which is particularly resistant to blight. These are crossed using controlled  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:48):**  pollination and the resultant plants are genetically uniform. The real problem is that any seed  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:11:56):**  produced by F1 hybrids is genetically unstable, not true to type, which means it cannot be  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:01):**  saved. Open pollinated seed, on the other hand, is when pollination has occurred naturally.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:07):**  These produce more genetically diverse seed, which means that plants can gradually adapt  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:11):**  to local growing conditions. This is particularly important in the context of climate crisis,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:16):**  and these seeds can be saved year on year. So open pollinated seeds are more genetically  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:22):**  diverse and you can harvest, save and sow those seeds year after year after year. By  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:29):**  contrast, F1 hybrids are genetically near identical and they can't be saved and re-sown.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:36):**  They have to be bought in every year. So why were these F1 hybrids developed in the first  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:42):**  place? Well, they do often have the potential to produce higher yields in any one year.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:49):**  And because the plants are almost genetically identical, they all ripen at the same time,  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:12:54):**  they look more or less the same, and they're very predictable. But we live in an ever changing  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:00):**  world. No two growing seasons are the same. The beauty of more genetically diverse open  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:06):**  pollinated seeds is that, over time, they often produce more reliable yields. And that's  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:13):**  precisely because they're not identical. For example, because the crops don't all  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:19):**  ripen at the same time, there's less damage if a disease strikes or if there's a surprise  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:24):**  hailstorm. What's more, because of their genetic variability, they have the capacity  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:30):**  to evolve and adapt. Now more than ever, our food security depends on that adaptability.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:38):**  It means the seeds can continue to thrive even as climate conditions change. So by saving  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:44):**  and sharing open pollinated seed, farmers, growers and communities are helping to secure  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:50):**  our food supply, making sure it can cope with increasingly erratic weather patterns. And  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:13:56):**  they're also reclaiming collective control of the seeds we all depend on to feed ourselves,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:02):**  ensuring that we can all have access to them, even during a crisis like, say, a pandemic.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:11):**  Between the links that we've created with the urban farming groups for seeds give away,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:18):**  for plants give away, when you're someone who starts growing, you easily give away because  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:23):**  there's always a moment where we produce a bit too much. And I think it's also in the  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:29):**  frame of mind to share all those skills. And obviously that starts with seeds and plants.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:36):**  And so when you save seed, you are becoming a part of a movement that is trying to reclaim  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:43):**  that process, that is arguing for seed sovereignty, which is concerned with reclaiming seed as  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:50):**  a public good and a commons. When we are reliant on large agrochemical companies for our seed,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:14:59):**  we cannot be building resilient, localised, just food systems because we're always going  
**[0:15:05-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:05):**  to need those external inputs. And so to be producing local, diverse, agro-ecological  
**[0:15:15-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:15):**  and open-pollinated seed, both on a commercial but also on a community level, is the beginning  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:23):**  of a system which allows us all to have more ownership of our food system. You know, this  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:30):**  is about long-term resilience and long-term food security.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:36):**  People bring things you've never heard of, or they bring something and you've never heard  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:40):**  of it, they grow it, and then you find that you know it from a different name and those  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:44):**  conversations spark off where names come from and the history of those things. So culturally  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:49):**  it's interesting that people bring a little bit of whatever, whether it's something that  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:54):**  the granddad grew for them when they were little or, you know, these stories.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:15:59):**  The London Freedom Seed Bank is a living seed bank, which means that we get seed in at the  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:05):**  end of the growing season and distribute that for free to whoever wants to grow food. Obviously  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:12):**  each year we're relying on a dedicated network of food growers who are saving and donating  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:18):**  seed. And it also means that year on year we're often saving quite different varieties.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:23):**  We notice in London that the bulk of people who are saving seed perhaps have second or  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:29):**  third generation migrant backgrounds. So there are some really, really brilliant varieties  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:35):**  being grown, like all sorts of squash, all sorts of different corn that are tricky to  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:40):**  get here otherwise. But also seed saving is a practice which is so much more established  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:45):**  in other parts of the world than here. And so I think there is something really powerful  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:52):**  about the rich diversity in what is being produced in London and who is producing it.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:16:59):**  We've got this huge task of revaluing that kind of knowledge that is saving seed and  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:05):**  that is producing delicious food.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:08):**  For me, especially being of Caribbean and Central American heritage, it is about liberation.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:19):**  It is about having freedom from a colonised viewpoint of what I should eat, how I should  
**[0:17:27-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:27):**  eat, what I should grow and how I should produce that food. So it is for me about reclamation  
**[0:17:35-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:35):**  of traditional African heritage and Amerindian foodways and being able to do that wherever  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:45):**  I am and appreciate knowledge and skills that we have as a community around food and food  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:17:53):**  production. When we understand how plants grow and where they grow and composting and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:01):**  seed saving, I think it provides a really firm foundation for people to start getting  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:10):**  into the politics of food. But for me it is about reclaiming a food sovereignty and sort  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:17):**  of claiming a health sovereignty at the same time.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:22):**  It's about choice. Not as an individual, the choice of which brand to pick off the supermarket  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:28):**  shelf, but as communities, the choice of how and where our food is produced and who gets  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:34):**  to enjoy it and be nourished by it.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:38):**  So what might food sovereignty mean for you and your community? Astrid is starting to  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:43):**  explore that with her neighbours in Chardende.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:46):**  Good morning everyone, my name is Astrid and this weekend, with the support of local businesses  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:53):**  and community members, we have organised a community event. This is the first step towards  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:18:57):**  self-sufficiency, sustainability and a stronger community. After living through three months  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:02):**  of confinement, it is an opportunity for everyone in Chardende to speak up on the changes they  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:07):**  would like to see in our area as much as what they want and need. If we work together, we  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:12):**  can create a communal space for everyone to enjoy. I encourage everyone to keep safe and  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:17):**  respect social distancing. Activities we'll have on the day will be all free, planting  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:22):**  and raised bed making, arts and crafts, seeds and plants giveaways, a bike repair stand,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:29):**  fruit and veg produce from the allotment, a DJ and some food. So see you all this Sunday.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:36):**  Bye!  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:37):**  Part of the people also involved had the local allotments, so we could show everyone what  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:43):**  can be produced locally. I think a lot of people were actually really surprised that  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:48):**  we could grow such a wide variety of veg just a couple of metres away from our houses. Kale,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:19:56):**  cabbage, cucumbers, courgettes, the list goes on. We can feed ourselves. And I'd like to  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:04):**  get rid of the idea that growing is either for old people that are retired or for people  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:12):**  that live in green landscape. Anyone can grow. Anyone can do it. We just have to do it together  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:20):**  so it's way easier to do it.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:23):**  Reclaiming food sovereignty also means learning how absolutely crucial the soil is to our  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:28):**  survival, learning how to look after it and to enjoy it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:34):**  I think we have in our head constantly, don't touch it, it's dirty. When actually, go on,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:39):**  touch it, it's dirty, but it feels good. It really feels good to have your hands in the  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:44):**  soil and the kids loved it.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:47):**  Without soil we have nothing, so we can't really see a more important place to start.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:20:56):**  Composting suffers from a bit of an issue where it's just felt that you pile things  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:00):**  up and you leave them for a certain amount of time, ideally years, multiples of years.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:05):**  Obviously, depending on where you live and your situation, that's either possible or  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:09):**  not. But yeah, the amount of questions and the sort of engagement we've had around composting  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:15):**  during this period has been amazing.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:18):**  I've had people doing composting in apartments, in flats, 15 floors up. People thinking, I'd  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:24):**  like to just do some hanging baskets and a couple of pots and go into the store and there's  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:30):**  just been no compost available. An obvious progression of when you can't get something,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:35):**  you look around and find out how to do it yourself.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:38):**  So we have five litre buckets that are left with the person for the week and then every  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:43):**  Friday we pick those up. Some people put all their waste, so they'll put cooked food and  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:48):**  everything in there, in which case we pre-compost it and we use Bokashi to do that.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:21:54):**  So Bokashi composting is the use of EM-1, which is effective microbes. It's inoculated  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:01):**  into a substrate. We use spent beer grains from the local brewery, sprinkled over food  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:07):**  waste, then gets fermented for a couple of weeks. And that concoction is what deals with  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:13):**  the waste that we generally feel that we can't process. Or they just put green waste in and  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:18):**  that is food for the worm farm. People love that, they love to be able to separate the  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:23):**  waste up and see that they're throwing less away and they're throwing less to landfill.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:29):**  We've got two massive landfill operations that surround us and the smell on some days  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:35):**  is absolutely awful. The council have allowed them to carry on their operations. But what  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:42):**  do we do? It's our waste, it's our problem. How do we combat it? And people really can  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:47):**  see this as a tangible way of cutting down what they throw to landfill.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:53):**  I've got a very big vision. There is so much that can be done. And what's been wonderful  
**[0:22:59-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:22:59):**  with doing this is actually the amount of people out there already doing similar things.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:07):**  It's actually just all about connecting all those dots. So with that space, the idea is  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:13):**  let's start with growing food. Can we better that? Because there's no point growing food  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:17):**  that nobody is going to eat. And that starts with us cooking and welcoming anyone that  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:24):**  is happy to host the session. We are one of the most cosmopolitan crowds. We could have  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:30):**  people from Asia, from Africa, from Europe sharing our cultures. After that, how can  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:37):**  we make that space pleasurable? It will be more than just raised beds. It will also be  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:42):**  a space where you can enjoy where you live, which we don't really have besides basic benches.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:49):**  But there we will have flowers, herbs to watch, to look, to touch, to eat.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:23:57):**  Eating food together and cooking food together, but also growing food together, provide that  
**[0:24:03-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:03):**  opportunity to discuss the complexities of our food system and the underlying structural  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:12):**  issues that affect people's ability to eat good food. We have been experimenting over  
**[0:24:20-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:20):**  the last couple years with different ways of getting good food to people in South Kilburn.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:29):**  We always wanted to develop a community supported agriculture scheme. And because of the pandemic,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:38):**  we've had to speed things up and we've just launched our Solidarity CSA scheme. Our shares  
**[0:24:46-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:46):**  start in at the cost of a healthy start vulture. So for £3.10, a family is able to get a small  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:24:57):**  bag of vegetables. The solidarity comes in where people who can afford it pay more for  
**[0:25:04-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:04):**  their own shares. So that supports people who can't afford to have a share to have one.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:13):**  Community supported agriculture supports a community working directly with farmers. So  
**[0:25:22-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:22):**  we're currently working with local growers within London, as well as farmers in Devon  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:32):**  and other farmers who are members of the Land Workers Alliance. Hopefully we get that community  
**[0:25:40-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:40):**  buy-in, supporting our local farming system, building our local food economy, as well as  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:49):**  meeting the food access needs of people. So what would it mean to have a food system that's  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:25:56):**  truly resilient? And what would it take to achieve it? So I guess to my mind, a resilient  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:02):**  food system is one in which people are able to produce and access sufficient, healthy,  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:08):**  culturally acceptable food in the face of various, even unpredictable events. So it's  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:14):**  about systems that are able to adapt quickly and make sure that all needs are still met.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:19):**  We are much more able to provide for ourselves and each other on a community, local and regional  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:24):**  level. We're more able to funnel resources to where they are needed most, and I think  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:28):**  that makes us more empowered to look after each other. We're fully embedded within our  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:33):**  community, locality being the thing. We've got three schools starting in September, and  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:38):**  they'll be coming three mornings a week. That's the way we want to take it. We want to make  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:42):**  sure that children have had exposure to this at an early age. So as they grow and as they  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:48):**  start looking for other alternatives, they've got some sort of grounding. We always wanted  
**[0:26:55-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:26:55):**  to start our own farm. So that's coming along slowly. The main barrier is access to land,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:05):**  and that's right across the board for any new entrant to farm in, but more so I think  
**[0:27:12-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:12):**  for us coming from an underserved part of the UK and being in a city. So we're looking  
**[0:27:21-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:21):**  to access probably a minimum of five acres on the peri-urban regions of London. Part  
**[0:27:30-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:30):**  of what we're doing with that is starting courses around learning to grow your own food,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:38):**  getting people and particularly young people of colour or needs to gain experience and  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:46):**  make that transition from sort of inner city community food growing to actually farming.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:27:54):**  Because the majority of our population are in urban areas, and I think as well as developing  
**[0:28:03-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:03):**  more urban and peri-urban projects, we should be encouraging people to go to the rural.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:12):**  We need people to be farming. We need to be more self-reliant, and the UK isn't right  
**[0:28:19-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:19):**  now because we depend on that global food economy to feed ourselves. So I think meeting  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:27):**  people where they are is always key to me, but then opening things up that you can move  
**[0:28:34-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:34):**  beyond where you are. And I think encouraging people in the countryside to be more welcoming  
**[0:28:44-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:44):**  of difference, be it ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. There is power in people  
**[0:28:54-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:28:54):**  communicating and connecting and as much as we're all zoomed out, I think having Zoom  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:03):**  has opened up a world of possibilities. People who would never really get in countryside  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:10):**  or people who are in countryside would never get to the city have been able to communicate.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:17):**  And I think we just need to be having these open, honest conversations about our political  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:25):**  structures, access to land and about the politics of food and just come to some sort of common  
**[0:29:33-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:33):**  ground for the benefit of everyone here in the UK.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:45):**  Seed sovereignty and food sovereignty form the basis of a resilient, equitable future.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:51):**  A future in which we can feed ourselves and our communities, even in the face of climate  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:29:56):**  change, economic crisis or a pandemic. It's a future in which everyone, not just those  
**[0:30:03-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:30:03):**  with their own land, can have easy access to fresh, nourishing, tasty fruit and veg.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:30:15):**  In the next episode of Who Feeds Us, we meet the millers and bakers quietly revolutionising  
**[0:30:20-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-3-growing-our-own#t=0:30:20):**  our most staple food.

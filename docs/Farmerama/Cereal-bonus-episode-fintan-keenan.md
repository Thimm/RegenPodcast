**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:00:00):**  So if you could first tell me what you had for breakfast just to test.  I had some sneaky pastries from the bakery which I shouldn't have had but I was able to steal a few.  Louise Bannon's specialities and they're incredible.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:00:15):**  That together with a good Cortado and that was enough. That was me set up for the day.  Music  Welcome to Cereal from Farmerama.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:00:28):**  This is a bonus episode featuring an interview with farmer, miller and mill designer Fintan Keenan.  I'm based in Denmark where I've been for the last 12 years and for six of those years I've  been working together with Pia Gruber who's a bit of a legend in the whole grain and milling world.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:00:50):**  That's basically where I learned my craft of old varieties of wheat and milling and the whole  knowledge around growing them especially organically and right now I'm actually  spreading that knowledge back to Ireland and helping people wherever I can with  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:01:10):**  you know the skills required in order to be able to get this whole movement off the ground.  Can you explain a little bit about why certain producers produce stone ground  rather than roller milled flour and some of the advantages and disadvantages of that?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:01:25):**  Oh tricky question. Basically you have two camps of people. You have people that are really pro  stone ground flour and religiously believe that that is the best way to make flour and then you  have the camp that says no I want roller mill flour. The two are very very different and it kind  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:01:43):**  of all comes down to what type of bread people are wanting to make. I think there's a middle ground  and I think that's what we should be aiming for and that's kind of what I'm trying to develop.  It's what the mill is like in Denmark. It's what the mill is like that I built in for Karen Springs  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:02:00):**  in Washington state. I recently completed a mill as well in southern Idaho using the same  principle of roller mill combined with stone mills and the advantages of that are that you can get  completely different types of flour that you can just with a roller mill or just with stone mills.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:02:18):**  Your options are much wider and also it has the benefits of the steel rolls doing a lot of the  hard work before it gets to the stone mill but you still have 100% stone ground flour.  If you choose to do that or you can send 80% of it through the stones or 50% of it through the  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:02:37):**  stones or you can mill entirely on the stone mills themselves if you want to. But I think  that's what we should be aiming for as well because it opens up much more options for the miller and  for the baker. In a commercial roller mill system you will have 20 roller mills so you'll have break  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:02:54):**  rolls and then you'll have fine rolls and basically what they are trying to do is extract as high a  percentage of flour out of that as possible but removing all of the bran so and that's where you've  got your oils that's where you've got your flavor in the bran and that's completely taken away  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:03:10):**  because they want to prolong shelf life. That's what the end result of the roller mill system is  is something that is long lasting can be put on a shelf for a year or two years and who knows how  long it's stored in the silo before it's even bagged and then shipped out. When you take the  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:03:26):**  stone ground flour you don't have that life expectancy you just have nine months shelf life  and it has to be used but what you what the aim of trying to get fresh flour back in is  exactly that fresh flour something that's milled and used within a week or two of it being milled  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:03:44):**  preferably on the same week because the enzyme activity is something that is super necessary  if you want to make good bread not something that's completely dead and void of life.  In the combined system you talked about you don't lose the nutrient can you just clarify that?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:04:02):**  No in the combination with the roller and stone mill no you don't. You've got different options  of when you send different parts of the grain kernel to the stone mill or you can send that  directly to the silo so everything is retained. You can do 100% whole grain flour or you can do  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:04:19):**  80% but everything can go through the stones. The only difference is you're sending it through the  roller mill first to basically on the first set of breaks you're shaving the kernel and so you  have very large bran flakes coming off with some of the the germ still attached to that but that  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:04:37):**  has been ground up in the stone as it passes through and the the benefit of that is you're  doing the hard work previous to the stone so the lifespan of the stones is prolonged because the  hard work is done prior to that which means that you have to less redressing on your stones as  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:04:58):**  opposed to sending the grains directly onto it and it's much harder it heats the flour more and  therefore you're going to have to maintain your stones longer and if you're doing that in a commercial  production where you've got you know if you're milling 500 kilos an hour and you're doing this  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:05:13):**  continuously you know 52 weeks a year or 50 weeks a year you don't want to be pulling your stone  mills apart every three weeks to redress them. You want something that's so that you can focus  on what you're really good at and not spending all the time maintaining something and back to  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:05:28):**  your to your answer is yes everything is retained in that system. I kind of have this, I'm veering  off a little bit, I have this idea that you know having small scale regional mills that have a  capacity of somewhere between 500 kilos and 1500 kilos an hour dotted all over the place not just  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:05:47):**  here in the UK or in Ireland or in Europe but you know all over the world where we can start to  localise grain economies so it's benefiting everybody's benefiting the farmers, benefiting  the millers, benefiting the baker, it's benefiting employment from people doing logistics you know so  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:06:04):**  it's an all-round winner as opposed to having these large commercial mills that are doing  200 tons an hour and then the grain has been imported from Manitoba or Kazakhstan or Ukraine  which is madness. It's something that we need to address and we need to change  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:06:21):**  the sooner the better because in the face of climate change it has to happen.  Going forward if we're looking to these relocalised grain economies you know what do we need for the  future of top quality grain systems? That's an interesting question. We need  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:06:44):**  re-skilling, we need new tool sets. Basically it comes back to the infrastructure has been dismantled  and it has to be rebuilt and that includes re-educating farmers, building local grain  economies in terms of infrastructure, grain drying facilities, grain processing facilities  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:07:01):**  and grain milling facilities and that's you know it's complicated and it's costly but if we want  that to happen that's what needs to happen, that's what needs to come into action and you can see it's  starting to happen you know there's a lot of enthusiasm out there, there's a lot of people  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:07:20):**  that are questioning the way that they're farming at the minute, there's a lot of people questioning  the products that they are buying in terms of flour so there is an interest in it and there's  a demand from it from the baker but it's going to take a lot of work in order for that to happen  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:07:34):**  to get growers on board, to get varieties out there and also like we're dealing with complex  cases as well in terms of weather you know it's become really unpredictable when we want to  harvest we can't, when we want to seed we can't, some years you can't plant winter wheat because  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:07:51):**  it's too wet you know these are all problems that we're going to encounter again and again and they're  becoming more severe. One of the biggest things that we need is sharing of information and that's  one thing that is not necessarily very common among people because there's this perception of  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:08:08):**  like oh I have this knowledge, this is my grain, I don't want to give you that but it's what's going  to have to happen if we want to change the system and that's going to have to come from the bottom  up it's not going to come from the top down so we're going to have to have these grassroots  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:08:20):**  structures in order to be able to re-establish local grain economies which is really exciting  and especially I believe with the new generation of farmers you see people like Fred Price, you see  Oscar here at Duchess Farms, you see farmer George and when you speak to them that enthusiasm is just  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:08:36):**  like boom you know it's incredible and if we can get so many people like that fired up who are  interested in it that's going to be contagious and that's what's going to help grow this local  economies. We have an amazing opportunity in terms of a global collaboration it's not just here it's  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:08:50):**  not just regional I think the sharing of information which I've just spoken about is  something that is happening from Australia to the States to Argentina to here in Europe you know  and it's incredible and I think with the drive and enthusiasm of that this will happen you know it's  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:09:06):**  not a question of how can we make it happen it's already started the wheels are in motion but we  need more events like this like PX plus where we're at right now so that we can get this  collaboration we can get farmers millers into the same room as bakers as chefs and  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:09:23):**  as chefs we can start talking about our food system we can start talking about where it's coming from  we can start talking about the problems and then find solutions and make all that happen so it's  not just about the grains it's also about the industry of food as a whole that even comes back  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:09:38):**  to travel transport you know it's all part of the bigger picture and it's something that we have to  address and one way of doing that like we're talking about our daily bread and butter and  that's literally what it is you know and that has to change it is happening but it's we need to gear  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:09:54):**  up it needs to happen a little bit faster some people think ah you know you just chill out a  little bit but it's I don't think we have the time to chill out I think we need to get this rolling  now as fast as possible and that's why you know events like PX plus here is really exciting because  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:10:11):**  you walk into that bakery and it's almost impossible to leave because of the conversations you're  having with somebody about something and then two minutes later you're off on a tangent in  a completely different direction but it's all related it's all relative which is fascinating  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-fintan-keenan#t=0:10:23):**  and it's really inspiring you know my head is spinning when I leave here I'm just going to be  like okay what's next what are we going to do what do I have to do you know which is really great.

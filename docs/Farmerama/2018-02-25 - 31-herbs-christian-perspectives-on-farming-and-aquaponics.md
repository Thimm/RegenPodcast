## 31: herbs, Christian perspectives on farming and aquaponics  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama. This month we hear from herb growers and suppliers about  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:09):**  the opportunities for growing herbs in the UK. We have the first in a series of reports  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:15):**  from Jubilee Farm in Northern Ireland, offering a Christian perspective on agriculture and  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:20):**  the environment. We take a visit to Humble by Nature, a tenant farm in the Welsh Wye  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:26):**  Valley run by TV presenter Kate Humble. And finally, we hear from an artisan pasta producer  
**[0:00:32-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:32):**  in Italy. One of the most exciting panels at last month's Oxford Veal Farming Conference  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:54):**  was all about growing and selling herbs in the UK. It was exciting to learn that there's  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:00:59):**  a real demand for good quality UK grown herbs and that more growers are finding ways to  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:04):**  grow commercially here on a relatively small scale. We caught up with a few of the panellists.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:11):**  Helen Kearney is a herb producer and medical herbalist. She farms in Devon where she's  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:16):**  a tenant of the Ecological Land Co-operative and she makes a living from a range of activities  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:21):**  involving the herbs she grows, including seeing patients, bulk supply and selling over the  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:27):**  counter products. She shared some tips and words of encouragement for new growers looking  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:32):**  to enter the market in the UK. So the reason that people aren't growing more herbs in the  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:37):**  UK, I think because it's mainly been focused on culinary herbs and the medicinal side of  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:45):**  things. There are some herbalists that have access to land, but it's rare for a herbalist  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:50):**  to actually be living on a small holding. The skills to grow those herbs, the medicinal  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:01:56):**  herbs just haven't really been developed in the UK. I don't know why. It's much more common  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:01):**  in the US and Australia, maybe because there's bigger land masses there so people have more  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:06):**  access to farms. The markets, it's cheaper for me to buy dandelion leaves from Eastern  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:13):**  Europe than it is to grow and pick and dry them myself, for example. So just the bulk  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:18):**  herb side of things, that's more complex. Value adding is the way to make money from  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:24):**  plants and so bulk growing of herbs just hasn't really been developed in the UK. The quality  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:30):**  is really important. So you want to get herbs to produce really good growth so they've got  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:38):**  the active constituents in them and they're not degraded in any way. So the real challenge  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:43):**  is when you come to process them, you need to pick them on a dry day, preferably before  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:48):**  midday because once the sun's gone onto the herbs, then if you brush up, for example,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:53):**  against the bush of lavender and you get that lovely aroma, that's the volatile oils being  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:02:57):**  released and you want them to be trapped in the plant as much as possible. So you're picking  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:01):**  the cool and dry and then once you've picked them, obviously that plant starts to degrade  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:06):**  so you need to very quickly process them or start to dry them because you're trying to  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:11):**  capture the maximum amount of the active constituents within that plant. The herbs that I produce  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:17):**  are the best quality possible because I'm picking them when they're absolutely ready  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:21):**  to be picked. I don't use any mechanical harvesting tools so everything's hand picked, hand processed  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:29):**  and that means I can buy an organic dandelion leaf from Eastern Europe but it just won't  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:34):**  be the same quality as something that I can grow and produce. And when I'm drying things,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:40):**  I'm drying things in small batches. We haven't got the sun and solar dryers in this country  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:46):**  so in other countries, for example, calendula or marigold, the petals end up very pale yellow  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:53):**  and the petals that I'm growing and producing are bright vivid orange because I'm small  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:03:57):**  batch growing and I'm not using a solar dryer so the heat that the flowers are getting to  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:01):**  isn't the same and they're not getting bleached out in the same way. So the viability of what  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:05):**  we're doing is we have a planning condition that we have to show that we're financially  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:09):**  viable because we apply for permanent permission to live on our land this year so we have to  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:15):**  pass the two tests, the financial test, the functional need test and the financial test  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:19):**  we have to meet our household needs through profit of the business and that's a challenge  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:26):**  but I'm a medical herbalist so I've got different income streams that I'm using to achieve that  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:32):**  and that's selling medicines to patients, selling the over-the-counter products as well  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:35):**  as selling the bulk herbs.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:37):**  Jim Twine is Managing Director of the Organic Herb Trading Company that sources and supplies  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:43):**  500 different types of herbs and botanicals for a variety of different uses. They've got  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:49):**  a couple of acres of their own land but for the most part they source from suppliers around  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:53):**  the world. Jim thinks there are definitely opportunities out there for UK growers.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:04:59):**  There's opportunities for a significant number of products that are either problem ingredients  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:05):**  for us like marigolds where there may be a history even in the organic sector of a background  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:11):**  level of pesticides or where there's ingredients that brands want a story behind them and particularly  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:20):**  like the idea of those being grown in the UK so there's a number of different categories  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:24):**  that those would fall into. What is also probably true to say is that products that we've sourced  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:30):**  quite often that have been fair wild from or wild harvested from southern Europe also  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:37):**  represent an area where growers could produce those in the UK or harvest them and supply  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:43):**  them to us in volume so elderflower, field mint, dandelion leaf, nettle leaf, some of  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:49):**  these would also be wild harvested, dandelion root and red clover. And then the last category  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:05:55):**  is really herbs or botanicals that are grown either in Europe or America where our guesses,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:03):**  the cost of production are relatively similar to the UK and as a result again it represents  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:08):**  an opportunity where growers in the UK can compete so oat flowering tops, cornflower,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:15):**  lemon balm, echinacea, skullcup, catnip, valerian root and lavender. The reason that their problem  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:23):**  herbs is that despite the fact that we know our growers are not in any way trying to break  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:29):**  the organic standards the issue is nearly always with a background low level of pesticide  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:36):**  residue contamination and very often that's as a result of spray drift or it may be a  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:41):**  legacy pesticide that's in the water course or it may simply be as a result of contamination  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:49):**  caused by unusual circumstances, for example a flood that then as a result of the run off  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:06:56):**  causes issues on the organic growers land. And those problem herb spices and botanicals  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:02):**  where there has been that background level of pesticides or herbicides is almost exclusively  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:09):**  outside the UK rather than any of the production that we've got based in the UK or our experience  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:15):**  of dealing with other UK growers. So there's probably two kind of fundamental challenges  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:20):**  to the growth of the organic herb market in the UK. The first is people being able to  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:26):**  have enough drying capacity to do a really good job of drying and then processing the  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:33):**  herbs that they may want to supply us or other businesses within the value chain. And then  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:38):**  the other issue alongside that is that if there is a problem, so for example a low level  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:44):**  background level of salmonella contamination, how do you fix that? And at the moment the  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:49):**  way in which that would be dealt with is through steam sterilisation and there aren't as far  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:07:54):**  as we know any steam sterilisation units that are willing to take small quantities of product  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:02):**  and steam sterilise them to reduce that background level of microbial problems. And what there  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:07):**  certainly isn't is anywhere that's organically certified as far as we're aware. So as things  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:13):**  stand at the moment our solution is to get things steamed in transit on the way to organic  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:18):**  herb trading if we identify a problem. One of the things that would be brilliant and  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:22):**  would be great from a sustainability perspective would be if we could link up someone with  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:28):**  a massive cold storage unit where the hot air is basically being wasted and build a  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:34):**  dryer alongside that because that would be a really environmentally sound way of harnessing  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:39):**  that energy and putting it to really good use. I don't, I mean we've got our own small  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:44):**  scale dryer and I suspect that the vast majority of the growers that are involved in the session  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:49):**  have got some kind of drying facility on site. Making it commercially viable and making  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:08:57):**  it stack up, again you really want to be able to do that on scale and we're not aware of  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:09:01):**  anybody doing that, certainly within the organic sector at the moment in the UK.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:09:08):**  We have one more interview from a speaker on the same herbs panel for you but you'll

**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:09:17):**  about her beautiful herb gardens and introducing a completely different approach to selling

**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:13):**  where we're having our first community volunteer day and as part of that we've had a short  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:17):**  service of dedication as we begin breaking ground in clearing this overgrown wall garden.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:24):**  I'm here with the Reverend Gabrielle Farquhar who, before she was a Presbyterian minister,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:30):**  ran a community horticulture project in Dublin. Gabrielle, I just wanted to ask you about  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:36):**  what you felt Christianity has to offer in terms of an agricultural and environmental  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:42):**  ethic for the 21st century. Thank you, Johnny. Well, first of all, what  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:48):**  Christianity has to offer goes way, way back to the beginning of time. God, when he created  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:10:54):**  the world, he made humankind last and then gave us the responsibility of caring for the  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:01):**  earth. And so it isn't a choice, it is our responsibility to do so. So as Christians,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:08):**  if we forget that and concentrate on all sorts of theological issues and think that they  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:14):**  only are important, we're forgetting what God has asked us to do as we live in this  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:20):**  world and through this life. Also, the whole idea of rest, rest not just for ourselves  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:26):**  but for the land, caring for the land, it was all part of his creation. And even on  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:32):**  top of that, and I just love this part in the Old Testament where they talk about leaving  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:39):**  the crop around the edge of the field, as it were, for the stranger, for the widow,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:45):**  for the orphan. So thinking of everybody, caring for everybody. So that's the Old Testament  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:51):**  part of it all and the New Testament the same. Gabriel, churches are often quite large landowners.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:11:58):**  They often have land immediately around their site or sometimes they own quite large estates  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:03):**  and the like. In terms of putting that ethic into practice, what contribution do you think  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:10):**  churches have given, for example, that here we are at Jubilee Farm, which is itself in  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:14):**  the grounds of an estate owned by the Sisters of the Cross and Passion? I think first of  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:22):**  all, it's great that this project is now able to happen here and to bring this walled  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:28):**  garden to life, just like the walled garden that we worked in Old Hallows in Dublin. And  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:34):**  it just gives such pleasure to people, such well-being and better for health. The churches,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:41):**  if they're sitting on land, are being totally irresponsible to what God wants them to do.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:49):**  Sometimes they forget. They think, oh, we can let it out for profit. And yes, they can.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:53):**  And I suppose if they let it out, at least somebody is going to work the land, which  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:12:58):**  is good. But to be a little bit more creative and to use it for allowing others, a bit like  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:05):**  me, to use the land and to guide the people who maybe don't have the resources, don't  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:13):**  have access to work in a garden, to touch a plant, to touch the soil. There are all  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:21):**  sorts of creative ways. Or in turn, to let it be a place where animals can stay. And  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:28):**  again, children can be brought from towns or in a town sometimes. Again, plenty of land  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:33):**  around churches. Open it up and let people enjoy it as it should have been. We have a  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:39):**  project in Ballycarrie where we brought our young people to Malawi. And the following  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:46):**  year we brought a group back from Malawi. And we all worked together, our young people  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:52):**  in the village from the different churches in Ballycarrie and the young people from Malawi.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:13:57):**  And we made what is now known as the Malawi Garden. And that was back in 2001. And it's  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:02):**  still going and the churches are responsible each for two beds and they maintain it. And  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:09):**  if one isn't able to, they then look after the other person. So working together and  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:14):**  it's beautiful.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:15):**  Thanks, Gabriel, for that inspiring example. And just as we end our report from Jubilee  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:20):**  Farm, here we work with Christians of all denominations, which in Northern Ireland in  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:25):**  a post-conflict context we feel is really important. But crucially, we also welcome  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:31):**  people of all backgrounds and belief to this place so that we can create space for people  
**[0:14:37-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:37):**  and for nature to flourish together.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:48):**  And now we meet Andrea Cavaliere, whose family have been producing pasta in Italy for generations  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:14:54):**  by what he calls the delicate method. We met him at We Feed the Planet, a slow food event  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:01):**  in Milan celebrating young farmers, which was the setting for episode three. This was  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:06):**  two and a half years ago now, a long time ago. But I can honestly still taste that pasta.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:14):**  When I was a little child, I used to go to our factory. I was five years old. And my  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:22):**  game was to go in the warehouse where we have the raw material and to try the different  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:29):**  variety. So for me to not cook, just semolina, and was so fun to understand the difference  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:37):**  in terms of taste, of chewiness. So it's the raw material that remember me when I was a  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:43):**  child. My family, I mean, continue to produce, but it's not sufficient for our... So that's  
**[0:15:49-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:49):**  why we try to convince new farmers to grow not the commercial variety, but that special  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:15:59):**  variety for us to continue, I mean, this tradition. It's very important for us not to buy the  
**[0:16:07-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:07):**  commercial wheat, but to visit it, to decide with our farmers which variety to grow in  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:17):**  which soil, I mean, and in which area, because every area has a special vocation for that  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:26):**  variety. It's like the wine, the grape. If you produce like a Chardonnay in the south  
**[0:16:31-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:31):**  of Italy, you won't see that bouquet, that fruit taste that the Chardonnay can have in  
**[0:16:39-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:39):**  the north of Italy, in Veneto, for example. So the wheat is the same. You can find the  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:48):**  right soil for the right variety. So we really are very connected. So we don't buy just the  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:16:54):**  commercial wheat, but we are connected with our farmers. Well, really, I don't have just  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:00):**  one favorite shape. I really love to change, and it depends from the seasonal raw material  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:09):**  we have. For example, when we have fresh vegetable in June, for example, I prefer like an organic  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:17):**  fusilli, organic whole wheat, in order to feel the taste of the organic pasta, but also  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:22):**  the fresh vegetable with extra virgin olive oil. During the autumn, for example, that  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:28):**  we begin to have a ragu, for example, the wheel, our Cresci wheel is perfect with meat  
**[0:17:33-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:33):**  ragu, for example. And when it's the time of zucchini, for example, I like the linguine  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:43):**  zucchini and prawns. It's perfect. So I don't have just a favorite shape, but I love to  
**[0:17:50-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:17:50):**  change, and it depends from the recipe.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:06):**  We hope you enjoy listening to Farmerama as much as we enjoy making it. A lot of work  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:12):**  goes into each episode, and we're always hugely grateful for support. If you're interested  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:17):**  in becoming a supporter, or if you know of someone who you think might be, please do  
**[0:18:21-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:21):**  get in touch. And you can do that through our website, Farmerama.co.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:42):**  Humble by Nature is a tenant farm in the Wye Valley in Wales, run by the TV presenter  
**[0:18:46-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:18:46):**  Kate Humble. And they're diversifying to explore aquaponics. I certainly find it difficult  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:12):**  to remember the difference between hydroponics and aquaponics. Aquaponics is the one with  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:18):**  the fish. We spoke to Beko on the farm to hear about the work she's been doing there.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:24):**  Aquaponics is basically using the waste from fish to feed plants. So fish are kept in tanks.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:33):**  We've got three large tanks and fish obviously eat and poo in the water. And the dirty water  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:40):**  is sucked from the bottom of the tanks and pumped to each grow bed. So we have 12 grow  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:46):**  beds. And within the grow beds is a media we call leka, which is an expanded clay. It's  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:53):**  basically like a light gravel, a bit like pumice, but it's made of clay. And it's got  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:19:59):**  a very high surface area. So beneficial bacteria live on that surface area and consume the  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:05):**  ammonia in the fish way. So as we know, animal waste begins to smell very quickly and produces  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:13):**  ammonia. And that ammonia is consumed by the beneficial bacteria and converted into nitrates,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:20):**  which as we all know, is what is used, chemical or manmade, to produce lots of lush green  
**[0:20:28-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:28):**  growth in plants. So that nitrate is taken up by the plants. And this means you can grow  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:37):**  lots of herbs, salads, things like that mainly in our greenhouse very fast because it's a  
**[0:20:45-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:45):**  nutrient rich water. And nutrient rich water that's being pumped into grow beds and it's  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:20:54):**  always available. The plants don't need to send out a huge root area. All the nutrients  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:00):**  are there for their taking. They can take as much as they want. So they grow very fast.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:05):**  And in turn, the plant's roots clean the solids and the ammonia or nitrates from the  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:11):**  water and the water is returned clean to the fish. So it's a closed loop. This means there's  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:17):**  no danger of any nutrient leaching or runoff into our environment, into the rivers. So  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:24):**  it's a totally closed system. Aquaponics isn't going to replace traditional farming. It's  
**[0:21:30-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:30):**  not going to replace livestock farming. Our farm is exposed. It's on top of a hill on  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:38):**  a kind of basin plateau. So we get waterlogged. And when it rains a lot, all the tables are  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:46):**  like, nymphs under the ground. I think it's clay. It's really, really not the ideal place  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:52):**  to grow crops. It's great for sheep and cats. But to grow vegetables, it's not an easy place  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:21:57):**  to grow. Aquaponics ideally is suited to urban growing and to be combined with industrial  
**[0:22:05-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:05):**  growing. So having worked there for three years now and discovered and made lots of  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:13):**  mistakes and learned lots of things, I think is ideally suited to if we could start designing  
**[0:22:19-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:19):**  systems to fit in within either domestic or agricultural or industrial setups. So we can  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:28):**  utilize the waste heat from humans, from livestock, to heat greenhouses. So you could have aquaponics  
**[0:22:37-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:37):**  systems on the sides of buildings, inside lots of flats or cities with lots of office  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:46):**  blocks, or if they were combined in conjunction with cattle barns, so they could use the heat  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:53):**  in the winter from the cattle. That type of thing. It would increase the sustainability  
**[0:22:58-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:22:58):**  of the systems hugely. And then you're utilizing the waste streams, be it waste heat or some  
**[0:23:07-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:07):**  systems can use maybe the manure in their system to increase the nutrition of the water.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:16):**  So I mentioned there's no danger of runoff from the system because it's a closed loop.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:23):**  It also enables you to maximize what you can grow in a single area. So our system is, I've  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:29):**  forgotten how many square meters it is, but we're growing fish, protein, food and vegetables  
**[0:23:36-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:36):**  in a small area. And because there's so much concern about the future of food and soil,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:45):**  it's a way of producing food on a small scale and a lot of food. And you can, the more you  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:52):**  feed the fish, obviously, the more they produce, the more nutrients the food, so the faster  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:23:55):**  the plants grow. So it's kind of everything you do in the system affects everything else.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:00):**  And I mentioned it's not going to replace traditional farming. We can't grow potatoes  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:04):**  in the system or carrots. We can't grow root crops because A, it's too damp. Our system  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:11):**  floods and drains every half an hour, which is just a bit too wet for those root crops.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:17):**  And because we're growing in the lecker, which is like a gravelly type thing, roots can get  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:22):**  a bit deformed. Some people have experimented and had some success with the root crops.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:29):**  I've had success, huge success this summer with ginger, actually. So because that grows  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:34):**  on kind of just the top few inches, it's managing to push out the gravel out of the way so it's  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:42):**  not being too deformed. And because our system is so warm, so full of nutrients and water,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:49):**  it's just growing like crazy. So it's more of this special, what's seen as exotic or  
**[0:24:54-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:24:54):**  what's normally imported to us. We can grow these generally imported high carbon foods  
**[0:25:04-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:04):**  quite simply on kind of 20 miles away. The system with very minimal input really. Our  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:13):**  main input is electricity. And we're working with Swansea University and another company  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:21):**  to develop more sustainable fish food that doesn't use fish caught from the sea, which  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:29):**  is then grown up, ground up and used to feed fish. Because there is, I think someone worked  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:36):**  out that we're actually using more fish from the sea to feed the fish we eat. And we're  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:43):**  actually, yeah, the amount of fish from the sea is more than we're actually growing. So  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:48):**  it just doesn't make sense to continue that system. There's all sorts of different ways  
**[0:25:55-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:25:55):**  of doing aquaponics. Our system, we got funding from the community gardens who got a plot  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:07):**  here and from the Welsh government. So we've got a lot of technology. So it's almost like  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:13):**  a showcase of what you can do. But you can make an aquaponics out of an old plastic barrel,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:19):**  cut off the top, turn it over, drill some holes in and just have a little pump and have  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:25):**  just a direct small cycle. So it doesn't have to be high tech and it doesn't have to be  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:31):**  complicated. You just have to know about plants and a little bit about fish helps and just  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:38):**  about systems and ecosystems and how it all works really.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:46):**  Something all of you can do to help Farmerama is to write a review on iTunes. It really  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:51):**  does make it easier for other people to find us. And please do share the podcast with your  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:26:56):**  farmer friends. We're always delighted to gain new listeners. We're also keen to hear  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:01):**  what you like, what you don't like and what we can do to make Farmerama both useful and  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:07):**  enjoyable for you.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:09):**  Farmerama is produced by me, Joe, Katie, who's presenting with me. Abbie's currently in Chile  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:17):**  for her yearly visit to the family farm, but has still somehow managed to find the time  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:22):**  to help us get this episode together. Also thanks this month to Johnny from Jubilee Farm  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:27):**  for his report. We're very much looking forward to hearing more from the farm in the coming  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:32):**  months.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/31-herbs-christian-perspectives-on-farming-and-aquaponics#t=0:27:33):**  Thanks for listening. See you next month.

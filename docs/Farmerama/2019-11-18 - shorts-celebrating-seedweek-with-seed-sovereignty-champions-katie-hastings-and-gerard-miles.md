## Shorts: Celebrating #SeedWeek with seed sovereignty champions Katie Hastings and Gerard Miles  
**[0:00:00-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this special short film on the  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:29):**  Gaea Foundation Seed Sovereignty Programme.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:30):**  The Gaea Foundation has been working to uphold indigenous wisdom and earth-centred perspectives  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:32):**  for over three decades.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:33):**  Here at Falmerama, we love the important work that Gaea Foundation and the Gaea Foundation  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:38):**  do in Wales, supporting a more diverse and ecological seed system.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:43):**  They are working together to preserve rare Welsh grain varieties falling into extinction  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:48):**  and to preserve the natural resources of the Gaea Foundation.  
**[0:00:51-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:00:51):**  Enjoy this conversation between Katie Hastings and Gerald Miles, recorded on a windy day  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:11):**  on Gerald's farm on the Pembrokeshire coast.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:16):**  So I'm in St David's in the beautiful Caires farm with an amazing farmer.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:23):**  I am Gerald Miles on the clifftops overlooking Aberaithy Bay.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:29):**  I'm so fortunate to be living here.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:33):**  I appreciate that I'm a guardian looking after my land.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:39):**  I was born on the farm, so I've been living on the farm for just over 70 years.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:47):**  I am the farmer, the farmer is part of me.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:51):**  I couldn't live without it.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:01:56):**  Farmers dedicate a lot of their life to a farm and they dedicate it to working on a  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:07):**  farm in very difficult conditions and with very little reward.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:14):**  What reward do you get?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:16):**  The satisfaction of growing crops, the satisfaction of actually organising oneself and doing the  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:28):**  job that you love every hour.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:32):**  You love what you're doing.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:34):**  Farmers and farmers all over the world have the same passion.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:40):**  My father took over this farm when he was 18, back in 1938, and he was a tenant farmer.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:49):**  And then during that time they were farming, they grew black oats and barley, some wheat,  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:58):**  not much.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:02:59):**  They used to grow the oats to feed horses and then they used to grow the barley and  
**[0:03:05-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:05):**  the black oats together because they ripened at the same time and this was a self-sustainable  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:14):**  contained farm.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:15):**  And this farm today, we farm it in a sustainable contained way.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:22):**  We have cattle, we grow vegetables, we grow grass to feed the cattle, all our cattle are  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:29):**  grass-fed.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:30):**  We grow cereals, ancient cereals.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:33):**  It's all a cycle.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:35):**  We grow the corn, we use the straw to bed the cattle in the winter, which turns into  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:45):**  compost manure and we put that back on the land.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:49):**  We grow grass with legumes, clover in it, that draws nitrogen out of the air and fertilises  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:58):**  the ground.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:03:59):**  And that's, and after five years we put corn in that field for two years, perhaps  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:07):**  three and rotate it again.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:11):**  And like our vegetables, our CSA, we grow them organically and use a biodynamic method  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:18):**  as well to feed 60 families.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:21):**  So it's a farm that incorporates the people, is sustainable and works within the limits  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:32):**  of nature.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:34):**  So the black oats, your grandfather grew, your father.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:38):**  So when did they stop being grown here?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:43):**  That stopped about 50 years ago.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:47):**  We lost the, nobody, farming goes in trends.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:54):**  Black oats weren't out of fashion in the end.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:57):**  It was Ferris' case.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:04:59):**  I couldn't find any.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:01):**  When I wanted to find it, this was over.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:04):**  It took me 20 years to find some.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:08):**  I found some through a rugby tour to Ireland, talking to a friend of mine who had a friend  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:16):**  as a farmer.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:17):**  And he said, this farmer grew black oats.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:22):**  So when they came on a rugby tour to St David's, he sent me 25 kilos in the back of a bus to  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:32):**  St David's on this bus.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:34):**  And now I've got 20 acres.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:36):**  So why did you want to find the black oat again?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:39):**  Why was it important to you to bring it?  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:40):**  Black oats is special.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:42):**  Why is it special?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:44):**  Because it ripens early, you can grow it with barley, which is a mixture that in Welsh you  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:50):**  call Shipris.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:52):**  It's a lovely plant to look at.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:54):**  It's a lovely grain.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:05:56):**  Horses, it's a good feed for horses and sheep, gives energy and condition.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:03):**  So when you grow it with barley, you've got barley giving protein and energy and the oats  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:10):**  gives condition and fibre.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:14):**  You know, why are you not just buying modern seed from a seed company?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:18):**  Why is it important to find the same seed that your father and your grandfather grew?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:23):**  Because I think they're the seeds that are sustainable for the future.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:29):**  We're in a climate change disaster at the moment.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:35):**  And these are seeds that were grown pre-Green Revolution.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:41):**  You see, we've grown these modern varieties with a short and we leave then, we lose the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:48):**  straw that needs to maintain the health and fertility of the soil.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:06:55):**  So do you think that heritage older seeds are generally better than modern seeds?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:03):**  Modern bread?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:05):**  Because earnestly, the ancient old heritage varieties are, I'm not being nostalgic, are  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:15):**  the seeds of the future and farmers will be using these.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:20):**  Why?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:21):**  Because we need it, because the climate will tell us, the fertility, the health of the  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:26):**  soil will dictate that to us.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:28):**  Like, do you find they have deeper root structure or like, are they more adaptable to the climate  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:35):**  here or?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:38):**  They are far more tolerant of the weather, tolerant of the soil conditions.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:46):**  They are a vigorous plant.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:50):**  Like some of the wheat we were talking over the weekend about, there's a variety I've  
**[0:07:54-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:07:54):**  had from Belgium when I was over there, Brotbach, that when it's planted at a distance of rows  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:03):**  of 10 inches, one seed tillers 10 plants.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:11):**  One seed.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:12):**  And we think we're clever today doing computers and robotics when one seed is a nature's  
**[0:08:20-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:20):**  computer chip that has got a moisture sensor, it's got temperature sensor and it produces  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:30):**  food for us and produces seeds to reproduce again.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:35):**  Think we're clever?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:37):**  So how did you feel when you found the black oat again, when you first sowed it in your  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:43):**  soil after all this time of not being able to find it?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:48):**  In these black oats, I was, I might as well have won a million pounds.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:53):**  I was absolutely overjoyed.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:08:55):**  And when I had it growing for the first time, it was a wonderful, a great achievement.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:06):**  You see, I'd advertised it in a farmer's magazine for about 25 years before.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:14):**  And this magazine, Well Farmers Weekly, was going all over Scotland, nobody or England,  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:20):**  nobody replied to it.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:21):**  So it was more or less extinct.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:24):**  And to finding it again and growing it, like all these ancient seeds, like the emmer wheat  
**[0:09:31-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:31):**  that dates back to the Egyptians, it's so rewarding to have, bringing them back to life  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:39):**  again.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:40):**  What would you say to young farmers who were taking farms on and were looking to like grow,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:46):**  looking at what crops to grow for the future?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:49):**  What would you say to them about their seed and what they should grow?  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:09:54):**  The young farmers, the future farmers should really look at these ancient varieties because  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:01):**  they would be more beneficial, more sustainable and they're healthier to eat.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:08):**  They'd be healthier in our food, in our bread.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:12):**  They maintain our human constitution.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:18):**  And what do you think about the idea that if seed is saved year on year from each region,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:24):**  that it adapts to that region?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:26):**  So there's seed that's like specific to your farm that would be adapted to your farm.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:31):**  Do you save your own seed year on year?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah, we've always saved.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:36):**  I've saved my own seeds for over 50 years.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:40):**  And yeah, you should save your own seed.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:45):**  By saving your own seed, it adapts to your soil, adapts to the climate of your region.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:50):**  Are you thinking of growing any mixed populations here in the future?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:54):**  Yeah, I am.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:10:57):**  The whole concept of thinking has got to change of the concept of seeds adapting to your farm  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:05):**  and to your soil.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:07):**  It's not any more looking in a catalogue, buying a variety, planting it in your field,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:14):**  getting so many tons and selling it.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:17):**  We've got to be more resourceful in the way we're thinking of having all seeds adapting  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:23):**  to your farm and making it part of your farming cycle.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:29):**  And actually, one thing I didn't ask you was like, how do other farms fit into this?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:33):**  So like, you can save your own seed year on year, it becomes adapted to your farm.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:37):**  But what do we need to kind of build a movement of people who are saving and preserving these  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:42):**  diverse grains?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:44):**  We need more farmers like me and smaller farmers who want to grow to really help each other  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:11:53):**  and form a serial circle.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:00):**  And this is what we're doing.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:02):**  Yes, making a circle working together, forming like we've done through the help of Gaia,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:11):**  forming Llafurni, which means our serials.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:17):**  And this is, we've got to take our rights, our own rights into our own hands, into our  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:26):**  own ownership.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:29):**  As farmers and growers stating the rights as peasant farmers and farmers in Wales to  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:36):**  hold our rights to our seeds and sharing our seeds.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:41):**  It's no point having a seed bank, keeping it in an area like money in the bank.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:50):**  You've got to create a multitude of seeds so it's accessible to farmers because we  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:12:57):**  will need this in 10 years time, everybody will need these.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:02):**  And it's no use turning around and saying it's too scarce.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:07):**  We need this now to multiply it and get more so we have enough to feed the population in  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:17):**  each of our areas.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:18):**  I don't like saying feeding the world.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:22):**  Feeding the world is not my responsibility.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:26):**  Feeding my local people is my responsibility.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:30):**  Using that phrase that corporate people use, feeding the world, every farmer all over the  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:37):**  world will feed their own areas.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:41):**  So saying that I'm responsible for feeding the world is bullshit.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:46):**  You're working with other farmers to basically get rare seed out of the gene banks to sow  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:50):**  it on your farm and then to share it with them.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:53):**  What motivates you to work with these other farmers and help them to get access to this  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:57):**  seed?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:13:58):**  We all are trying to make a living and the only way we can survive is working together.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:05):**  We as farmers have been driven to work in an isolated way but we must work together  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:11):**  to survive.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:14):**  To survive so that we share knowledge, share seed and share a living together.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:22):**  So you've been working with the Gaia Foundation and with other farmers in Wales to kind of  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:27):**  build this movement for grain sovereignty.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:30):**  What do you think are the next steps?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:32):**  What do we need to do to preserve diversity in Wales?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:36):**  The step forward from sharing seeds and sharing knowledge is to really obtain machinery, to  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:44):**  share machinery in every locality.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:48):**  We need a de-huller for seeds.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:52):**  There isn't one to be had, there's only one to be had in Wales.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:14:56):**  It's something we need and share and we could do share it between a group of us farmers  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:03):**  like a reaper binder, like a combine harvester.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:10):**  These machinery are things that we need to source and they're old machinery that are  
**[0:15:16-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:16):**  going extinct but are the very machinery that are needed for small growers to use locally.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:26):**  And they're small adaptable things that can be used without much distance and share it  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:34):**  between us.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:35):**  And why aren't these machines around on farms anymore?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:39):**  What's happened?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:41):**  Because farming has progressed, it's modernised, it's grown from 50 acres to 1000 acres.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:50):**  Like my local contractor, he's got three combines which are 10-12 foot wide cutting.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:15:58):**  Now this year he's bought a combine that is 33 foot pick up reel on it.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:06):**  It isn't something we as small farmers can use.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:11):**  Small farmers are going extinct because the future is small and local.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:21):**  But 72% of the world is fed by small farms and we've got to preserve those farmers  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:29):**  to preserve the knowledge for the future.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:37):**  November 18th marks the start of Seed Week.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:40):**  You can help support the work on seed sovereignty in many ways.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:44):**  As consumers we can do our best to buy grains and seeds from small scale ecological producers  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:50):**  and as farmers we can think about buying genetically diverse grains and vegetable seeds as well  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:55):**  as saving seed to help preserve regional diversity.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:16:59):**  If you'd like to learn more, the Gaia Foundation offer lots of free resources both for commercial  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:17:04):**  growers and home gardeners on seedsovereignty.info.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/gaia-fondation-black-oats#t=0:17:09):**  Thank you for listening.

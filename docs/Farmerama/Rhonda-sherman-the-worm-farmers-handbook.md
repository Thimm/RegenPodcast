### Farmerama  (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:03:14)
**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to this special interview with vermicomposting aficionado Ronda Sherman.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:15):**  Author, researcher and director of the Compost Learning Lab at North Carolina State University.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:26):**  This episode is part of our Women of the Land series with Chelsea Green Publishing, in which  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:31):**  we feature women who are fueled by their connection with the land, to build businesses, garner  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:36):**  movements and share their stories.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:40):**  They're standing up for what they know works and crafting a better future for us all.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:49):**  Ronda Sherman has had a long and wide spanning career in recycling, waste management and,  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:55):**  since the mid-nineties, vermicomposting.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:00:57):**  Her expertise has guided worm enthusiasts across the world in setting up their own businesses  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:03):**  and projects.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:05):**  Ronda's book, The Worm Farmer's Handbook, is an authoritative how-to guide that demystifies  
**[0:01:11-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:11):**  the science and logistics of the fascinating process that is vermicomposting.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:19):**  Let's dig into the wild world of worms.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:29):**  To start with, I just wanted to acknowledge that you've obviously had a really long career  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:32):**  working with waste reduction, composting and recycling.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:36):**  And maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you got started with vermicomposting in  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:42):**  particular.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:44):**  I was hired by NC State University, North Carolina State University in 1993 to help  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:52):**  people to recycle because laws had recently been passed saying you must recycle.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:01:59):**  And so I'm at a land-grant university and so people were calling the university saying,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:04):**  what do I do?  
**[0:02:05-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:05):**  And so it was households, businesses and city and county offices saying, what do we do about  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:13):**  recycling?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:14):**  One of the fact sheets that I put together was called Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:22):**  And it just took off.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:25):**  I mean, it was just a career-changing moment for me.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:28):**  I never expected it.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:30):**  And then phone calls and emails were just pouring in eventually from all over the world  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:37):**  saying we want to learn more about vermicomposting.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:40):**  And so I really had to shift what I was doing just to answer popular demand.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:50):**  The worms require a moist environment just so they can breathe.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:02:55):**  So you need to have some kind of bedding for them to be in that's moist.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:01):**  And then you add food, wait till it's consumed and then add more.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:08):**  It's pretty easy to do.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:10):**  One of the first things you do talk about in your book is how vermicomposting is different  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:15):**  to composting.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:17):**  So with composting, the goal really is for your pile to heat up.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:25):**  So we call it thermophilic composting, a combination of materials together with the right moisture  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:31):**  and bulk density.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:34):**  And the microorganisms in that pile will secrete enzymes and begin to degrade the organic materials.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:43):**  But the activity of the microorganisms creates heat, which is a good thing because it accelerates  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:50):**  the decomposition of the pile.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:52):**  But also, if you reach high enough temperatures, it will kill pathogens and seeds.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:03:59):**  And so worms are not involved with that.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:02):**  And sometimes people try to combine the two and they really should be totally separate  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:07):**  things.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:08):**  They're separate processes.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:11):**  There are just so many scientific studies that have shown that vermicompost has a much  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:19):**  higher benefit to soils and plants than compost does.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:25):**  Here in the United States, if a compost manufacturer sells a cubic yard of compost, they can sell  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:34):**  it for about $30.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:36):**  Whereas if they try to sell a vermicomposter, tries to sell a cubic yard of vermicompost  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:43):**  or vermicast, they can sell it for $200 to $1,000 per cubic yard.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:51):**  So a huge difference.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:53):**  You'll have greater numbers and greater variety of microorganisms in vermicast.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:04:59):**  And it's because it doesn't go through a heating cycle.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:03):**  We call it cold composting.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:06):**  It stays at, you want it to stay at ambient temperature.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:11):**  The sweet spot for vermicomposting is pretty much 70 degrees.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:15):**  More microorganisms, and you also have plant growth hormones and humic and fulvic acids  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:21):**  that are in the vermicast, which helps seeds to germinate more quickly.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:27):**  The plants will grow bigger and stronger.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:30):**  They'll have better developed root systems.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:33):**  They'll have greater yield.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:35):**  You'll also have disease and pest resistance that is part of the vermicompost, and it has  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:43):**  that effect on plants.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:45):**  And then the benefits for soil.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:48):**  It adds organic matter.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:51):**  It improves the soil structure.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:05:53):**  It increases the cation exchange capacity, makes cultivation easier, helps the soil to  
**[0:06:00-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:00):**  absorb and retain water.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:11):**  In some ways it sounds easy, like, oh yeah, just get some worms and feed them not too  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:14):**  much and keep them damp and you'll be fine.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:17):**  But can it go really wrong?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:19):**  Unfortunately, there are many ways to accidentally kill the worms, you know.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:26):**  That's why I have over 25 years' experience of writing and teaching about it in a way  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:36):**  that is easy to understand.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:39):**  Like, my worms can recycle your garbage.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:43):**  That publication still exists.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:46):**  It's only five pages.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:48):**  So it's a quick, easy read.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:51):**  Though I encourage people to reread it a few times before they actually set up a worm bin.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:06:57):**  Although my book is about mid to large scale worm farming, I encourage everyone to start  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:04):**  with small scale.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:06):**  So you want to take My Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:09):**  It tells you how you very easily can set up a worm bin.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:15):**  You can buy one online, but you can also just take a plastic container with a lid and drill  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:22):**  holes along the top sides of the bin for air.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:28):**  And then fill it halfway with moist bedding, which could be shredded newspaper or shredded  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:36):**  office paper.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:38):**  And then you add the worms.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:40):**  So if you pay attention to what I've written about, you'll be successful.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:47):**  And one thing I've really stressed for people is that when you're dealing with food waste,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:55):**  there's always the chance of attracting fruit flies.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:07:58):**  You know, they just kind of show up, right?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:01):**  But if you cover the food scraps, you know, this is where I encourage people to be OCD,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:09):**  you know, obsessive compulsive disorder.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:13):**  Only this one little thing.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:16):**  I just say cover the food scraps so that when you open your bin, you can't see any food  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:22):**  scraps.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:23):**  You only see whatever your bedding is and you will not attract fruit flies.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:36):**  Another thing I always think is interesting about compost is also like, you know, smell  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:41):**  is quite a distinctive indicator of health.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:44):**  Is that the same with vermicompost?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:46):**  Yes.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:47):**  Many people have created furniture that's a worm bin.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:08:52):**  People have a lovely coffee table and in their living room, but it also is a worm bin.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:00):**  And if you're doing things correctly, there won't be any odor whatsoever.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:05):**  You have the lid on your worm bin.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:08):**  And when you do open the lid, it should just smell earthy like forest soil.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:15):**  So it's great.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:16):**  I mean, I used to keep my worm bin in my, well, I used to keep it at my feet in my office  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:21):**  under my desk.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:23):**  I kept it at home in my bathroom, you know, cause there's the counter and then the, you  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:30):**  know, there's a big empty space between the drawers.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:33):**  So it's a good place for a worm bin, you know?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:36):**  And so is there like, you talk quite a bit in amazing detail about how to feed the worms.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:42):**  And so I have two questions around that.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:43):**  One is like, you know, from a food waste perspective, is there anything you wouldn't put in your  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:48):**  vermicompost pot?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:09:52):**  So I would not put in meat, fish, dairy products, bones and fat and grease because those could  
**[0:10:01-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:01):**  have, those will produce an obnoxious odor, but it will also attract carnivores.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:10):**  So you know, rats, cats, raccoons, possums, all sorts of things would be attracted to  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:21):**  it.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:22):**  You know, I don't put dog or cat poo.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:24):**  I don't put orange and citrus.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:29):**  I don't put citrus peels and parts into a worm, into a small worm bin.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:36):**  You can with a larger system, like what I write about in my book, but in a smaller system,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:43):**  it'll throw off the pH and make it acidic.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:47):**  And then that can cause red mites to proliferate and out-compete the worms.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:55):**  How would you, or, you know, how do you think about it?  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:10:57):**  Say you're a dairy or a cattle farmer versus if you have a market garden or a wormery at  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:02):**  home, you know, feeding the worms, you can take quite different approaches.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:08):**  The dairy manure is really the number one feedstock fed to worms that I'm aware of throughout  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:17):**  the world for vermicomposting.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:21):**  So dairy manure is a great feedstock for worms.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:26):**  And also I remember reading that actually the outcome in terms of the nutritional value  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:34):**  of the vermicompost in terms of what you want to grow in it is actually quite different  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:38):**  depending on what you feed the worms.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:40):**  Yes, it's very different.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:44):**  I'm laughing because it was hard to write about in the book.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:47):**  It's hard to explain to people.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:48):**  But yeah, if you think about it, you know, that what you feed the worms and then what  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:56):**  comes out the other end is going to be different.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:11:59):**  So if you fed them dairy manure or if you fed them food waste or say paper waste, then  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:06):**  the vermicompost is going to have different nutrients and microorganisms and plants are  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:14):**  going to respond differently to that.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:17):**  Obviously your book is focused on mid to large scale vermicomposting.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:21):**  And so at that kind of scale, you know, how are worm bins integrated into different types  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:27):**  of farm systems and how difficult is it to, you know, if I'm a farmer and I wanted to  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:32):**  make a usable amount for a farm scale, you know, how difficult is that?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:37):**  So basically you need one pound of worms per square foot of surface area.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:45):**  So it's a matter of having enough worms for the feedstock actually.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:50):**  And so do you know of any farms that produce all of their own vermicast to spread at like  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:12:57):**  the farm scale?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:01):**  I mean, the really great thing about vermicompost is that it's so potent that a little bit goes  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:09):**  a really long way.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:13):**  You know, you really only need to use about 10% 10 or 20% by volume of whatever your amendment  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:23):**  you're adding to the soil needs to be vermicomposed.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:28):**  And in terms of, cause I, you do talk a bit about like vermicompost tea, from your perspective,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:35):**  you know, do you think it's better to apply vermicompost direct or can it be equally as  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:40):**  effective to apply a tea or an extract?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:45):**  If it's brewed correctly, it could be equally effective.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:50):**  And it's nice if you can do both, you know, if you can initially plant it with, well,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:13:59):**  I mean, but you don't have to.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:01):**  I was going to say it's nice if you can initially plant with solid vermicompost and then a pot  
**[0:14:10-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:10):**  apply a foliar spray or soil drench of vermicompost tea, but it can be done independently, you  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:22):**  know?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:23):**  Yes.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:24):**  So whatever you want to do, but vermicompost tea and compost tea, it's still kind of a,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:34):**  there are still a lot of disputes about it and, you know, cause there are different ways  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:40):**  of going about it.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:41):**  And you know, you can have non aerated or aerated and people like to add different additives  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:49):**  to it.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:14:52):**  And then there's also the myth of access liquid coming out of a worm bin and people calling  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:01):**  it worm tea.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:03):**  That is totally incorrect.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:04):**  So, you know, when I travel around the world, I try to point that out to people because  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:09):**  basically if you're managing a worm bin correctly, you will not have excess liquid coming out  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:16):**  of the bottom.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:18):**  If you do have excess liquid, you should be reviewing your management processes to figure  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:24):**  out why you're producing excess liquid because you shouldn't be.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:28):**  But if you do produce that excess liquid, there could be all sorts of problems with  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:33):**  it because it's not supposed to be there to begin with.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:38):**  So I tell people, you know, just throw it out.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:42):**  Now to correctly make vermicompost tea or compost tea, you need to be very aware of  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:50):**  pathogens and try to minimize the number of pathogens that would be in the tea.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:15:57):**  So it's really important to have clean equipment, clean water, good quality vermicompost or  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:05):**  compost and to not add sugars.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:10):**  Some people, they like to add those things to the tea to increase the microbial numbers.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:18):**  But the problem is there will always be small numbers of pathogenic microbes.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:28):**  So you're also increasing their numbers greatly if you add sugars.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:32):**  To be on the safe side, I just say don't add sugars.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:36):**  You mentioned that you covered some case studies in the book, which I found fascinating, really  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:42):**  cool, like a great overview for many different countries.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:46):**  And I was wondering, a few of them really caught my attention.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:52):**  Maybe you could talk a bit about the Green Organic Project in Afghanistan.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:16:55):**  There's a woman, she and her husband, but you know, so this is a woman owned business  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:01):**  in Kabul, Afghanistan.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:04):**  And she has the only woman owned organic materials recycling facility that has vermicomposting  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:12):**  production.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:14):**  And so, you know, it's just great what they're doing.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:18):**  And they're doing it on a large scale.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:21):**  And they're doing it with the materials they have on hand, which is concrete blocks.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:27):**  You know, they have access to concrete blocks.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:31):**  And so they've built numerous worm bins from concrete blocks.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:37):**  How did you feel when they got in touch?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:39):**  Oh, I was thrilled, you know, because in Afghanistan, you know, women have not had as many opportunities  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:48):**  as men.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:17:49):**  And so she pitched a business plan to USAID to assistance in building Afghanistan by developing  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:02):**  enterprise.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:03):**  And so she got training and got grants.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:06):**  And she and her husband have just worked very hard.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:09):**  And so we stay in touch by email and they're Facebook friends.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:17):**  So we put a little tweet out to our listeners to see if they had any questions for you.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:32):**  So I was wondering if I could ask you a few quickfire questions from them.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:38):**  So how often should I feed my worms?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:42):**  I have a small wormy in my community garden and we currently feed primarily vegetable  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:47):**  scraps.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:48):**  Well, ideally, you would only feed after your last feeding has disappeared.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:56):**  That's what's ideal.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:18:59):**  You know, if you have lots, if you have plenty of worms, well, I mean, really, no, in any  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:07):**  circumstance you should wait until the food is gone.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:11):**  Should I water the vermicompost?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:13):**  How do I check if the moisture is right?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:15):**  You want your vermicompost, your worm bin to be like, if you're doing mid to large scale,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:22):**  you want it to be a gradient so that the top four inches would be about 80% moisture, which  
**[0:19:32-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:32):**  means that if you took a handful of the organic material, you know, bedding and squeezed it,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:40):**  you would get a few drops of water.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:42):**  That means about 80%.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:44):**  But you don't want the entire system to be 80%.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:48):**  The deeper it goes, you want it to be drier.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:19:52):**  The worms stay in that top four inches and you want them to stay there.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:00):**  And you don't want to overwater the bin.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:02):**  And so it's a matter of when you set up the bin, you make sure there's plenty of moisture  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:09):**  in the bedding.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:11):**  And then after that, you don't, you don't, you never pour water into your system.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:18):**  You only spritz it.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:21):**  Worms love moisture.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:22):**  They'll follow the moisture.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:24):**  So if you have a bunch of water coming out of your bin, your worms could follow it and  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:29):**  they could exit your bin.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:31):**  And that's not good.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:33):**  Well that leads nicely onto the next question, which is why are my worms crawling away?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:38):**  That's why.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:39):**  There are several reasons why they would crawl away.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:46):**  That's one of them that they're following water.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:49):**  And also that can happen when it's raining.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:52):**  You know, if you have a big storm and there's a lot of water that changes the barometric  
**[0:20:59-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:20:59):**  pressure, and the worms tend to want to exit and follow the water, you know.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:08):**  And so that's one reason.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:10):**  But also if, if you overfeed, then it can produce alcohol and ammonia buildup in the  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:19):**  bin.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:20):**  And that will make the worms want to leave.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:24):**  If the conditions are too hot, too dry, too, too wet, too cold, that can make them want  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:32):**  to leave the bin.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:33):**  So in my, again, my free publication on my website called Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage,  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:40):**  I have a troubleshooting guide.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:42):**  And it, so you can look at it and you know, hey, this is happening with my bin.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:48):**  And then I tell you why and then how to remedy it.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:53):**  And finally, what can I do to keep the worms, sorry, what can I do to keep the worms warm  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:21:58):**  enough in the winter in the UK?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:01):**  It's actually easier to keep worms warm enough rather than to cool them down when it's super  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:10):**  hot.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:11):**  So there are just so many ways you can help keep them warm.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:16):**  And I talked about that a lot in the book, you know, I gave several suggestions, you  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:21):**  know, but which can include using insulation, like household insulation can be, can surround  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:29):**  your bin.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:30):**  You can put hay bales around your bin, blankets, you can use electrical devices, you know,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:37):**  like soil heating mat can be put on, you know, on top of the bedding in your bin.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:45):**  And just a number of things can be done.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:48):**  I always end with one question, which is, many of our listeners are from the small to  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:52):**  medium scale farming community.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:22:56):**  And do you have anything you want to share with them or a message or yeah, any insights  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:03):**  for them?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:05):**  Worms love animal manure.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:09):**  And so if you have goats or goats, sheep, cows, pigs, horses, llamas, alpacas, a number  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:24):**  of animals, you can feed that manure to the worms.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:29):**  But the only manure you have to keep away from worms is chicken manure.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:36):**  So chicken, any kind of poultry manure should not be fed to worms, it's too high in ammonia  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:43):**  and it will kill the worms.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:47):**  The Worm Farmers Handbook is a brilliant compendium of case studies, technical information and  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:52):**  learnings from many years of vermicomposting.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:23:55):**  A practical guide into the why and the how behind worm farming at different scales that  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:02):**  draws on the experience of others around the world.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:07):**  Rhonda's book couldn't be more timely.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:09):**  It feels like a transformative moment in the world of composting, as more people give attention  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:14):**  to soil biology and realise that compost is not just about dead organic matter.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:20):**  It's about applying a living matrix.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/rhonda-sherman-the-worm-farmers-handbook#t=0:24:24):**  And that's exactly what these wonderful worms create.

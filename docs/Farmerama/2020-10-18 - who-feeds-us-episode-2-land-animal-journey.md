## "Who feeds us?" Episode 2: Land, animal, journey  
**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:00):**  Who Feeds Us? From Farmerama Episode 2 Land. Animal. Journey.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:15):**  This series is a chorus of voices from people across the British Isles, people on the land  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:20):**  and the seas, on allotments and city roofs, the stories of farmers, growers, community  
**[0:00:26-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:26):**  leaders, healers, chefs, beekeepers, fishers and others. This is Who Feeds Us.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:38):**  We often hear that animal products are unsustainable. In reality though, it's often the way these  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:44):**  products are produced that's unsustainable. A system that, for example, requires dairy  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:49):**  farmers to pour their milk down the drain in a crisis, rather than selling it to their  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:53):**  communities is clearly not a system that's focused on nourishing people or planet. So  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:00:59):**  who are the farmers, fishers, cheese makers and butchers who are finding new ways to connect  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:05):**  with their customers, their communities and their animals? And how could we all benefit  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:10):**  from knowing more about how our cows are raised, our meat is slaughtered and our fish is caught?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:17):**  In this episode, we hear from a fishmonger in the Shetland Isles and a farmer in Wales  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:22):**  who provides organic halal meat to customers across the UK. We learn how the pandemic has  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:27):**  impacted their work and their relationships with the people they serve.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:33):**  But we begin in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, at the start of September, with a visit to  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:38):**  the dairy farm and cheese making business run by Dean Wright.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:42):**  And you can see another small cottage in the background, which is Mudwall Cottage that  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:48):**  dates back to 1600s. Now we lived in that cottage until I was 10. And that would have  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:53):**  been the original house that was bought in 1820 with two or three acres of land on this  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:01:58):**  building. Our local town has a small population of around 25,000 people. It's not a very  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:04):**  big place in terms of you know, some of the other places in the UK and Ireland, but nice  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:09):**  place to live and nice place to grow up. So I'm truly thankful for what we had as children  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:14):**  and young adults. There was no central heating in that house and it stayed naturally warm  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:19):**  because the walls are three feet thick. Warm in the winter, naturally cool in the summer.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:24):**  I think that's total sustainability for you. I'm Dean Wright and I'm the founder member  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:30):**  of Ballyless Dairies Ltd here in Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. Is there  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:36):**  a way of talking to people I suppose? I was born into a farming family. We had a small  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:42):**  family farm. I undoubtedly worked in the meat trade, in the red meat industry for a number  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:46):**  of years. But I suppose as life went on, I would like to do something for myself as I  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:51):**  had a family. I'm the youngest of four sons and I farm the farm and that's basically where  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:02:56):**  our milk comes from for the cheese plant. The milk doesn't have far to go. Just a couple  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:03):**  of miles down the road that runs alongside the 200 acre family farm to a small industrial  
**[0:03:09-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:09):**  estate where the Ballylisc cheese is made. I'm 47 now. I look back over the years. There's  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:18):**  four generations of the farm that I remember. My own parents, my grandparents, my great  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:24):**  grandparents and then my two daughters. So I can remember actually five generations on  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:29):**  this farm. Who's going to be the sixth generation? I have no idea. No, my daughters are the next  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:35):**  generation. I would never discourage them but I'm not encouraging them to farm. Who  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:41):**  knows? Time will tell that one. So let's go in and we'll see what's happening in here.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:48):**  In their original pre-pandemic vision of this year, Dean and his colleague Chloe were looking  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:54):**  to continue production of their trademark triple rose white mulled cheese, which they  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:03:58):**  describe as decadent, as well as developing new varieties at the plant.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:03):**  The filter there, heat, hot water, water storage, cold water storage, water treatment and everything  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:08):**  else happens up here. The business has been going quite a few years now but we have been  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:15):**  trading for approximately 27, 28 months. We did a lot of research and development work  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:21):**  on how we were going to structure our business, what did we want to bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:25):**  Those were all the things that we did actually before we constructed the plant. So what happens  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:34):**  here is this is the main production room of the cheese. The pasteuriser directly places  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:40):**  the milk into the cheese vats. The milk is cultured, turned into cheese, curds and whey.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:45):**  Then it's moulded off into these moulds as you can see on the table and then it will  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:49):**  go on to the next phase which will be salted on day two and then it will go into a ripening  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:54):**  room at a specific temperature, specific humidity and it stays there for a period of weeks.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:04:59):**  We'll move on there next. We catered for food service which was predominantly the hospitality  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:05):**  industry, you know the high end hotels, high end delis, restaurants, that type of things.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:09):**  Now lockdown came, they didn't have a choice, it wasn't their choice to close their businesses.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:15):**  It was forced upon them and forced upon the nation. It probably was one of the worst business  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:20):**  days for us as food producers. We lost approximately 70% of our business within 24 hours. Phones  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:28):**  were ringing, if the orders weren't dispatched, do not dispatch it and I don't want any more  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:32):**  product. We are now closing etc etc. It went on. So lose 70% of your business within a  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:38):**  24 hour period is quite harrowing. We're now in the ripening room where the cheese enters  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:45):**  the ripening room on day two. This temperature that we're in at the moment is absolutely  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:50):**  perfect for mould growth. We're going to look at some cheese actually which is on day four  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:05:55):**  which actually hasn't developed this mould just yet. At day six you will see that nice  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:01):**  cream colour will actually turn into a very, it will be like mist in the morning on day,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:07):**  late day five, early day six. By early day seven it will be totally white. So there's  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:12):**  a very quick transition once the mould starts to grow. Basically the mould is a protective  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:17):**  layer on the outside of the cheese and also that mould actually helps to break down the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:22):**  milk and turns those curds into, gives them a taste profile, how smooth, how chalky they  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:28):**  are. I would say we were seven days from closure in terms of young business has no natural  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:35):**  reserves. I think that was the key driver. What do we need to do to survive the storm?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:41):**  We are now in the warm part of the factory. We're sitting here probably plus one. We're  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:46):**  in the dispatch chill where you can see all the finished product wrapped and labelled  
**[0:06:51-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:06:51):**  with our logo ready to go and it's held at one degree here. When you sleep with one eye  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:05):**  open you get very good inspirational ideas. You know, think and think and think and keep  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:10):**  thinking outside the box. What resources have we to play with? What resources are we good  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:15):**  at making? The big challenge for me was the consumer can't get to the shop so the obvious  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:22):**  idea was take it to the consumer. That was a very good starting point. Then what are  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:26):**  we going to take to the consumer? What does the consumer use every day? The consumer uses  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:30):**  milk. Where do we have milk? We have milk on the farm. You know, we had the processing  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:34):**  equipment for the cheese plant here. It wasn't a big transition. Chloe and myself probably  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:40):**  did some of the longest and hardest week we did in terms of seven days. You're talking  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:45):**  about 20 hours a day but to turn a concept into reality within five to six days I think  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:50):**  it was a relatively good performance. We refocused, we regrouped and within approximately four  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:07:56):**  to five days we basically put a doorstep delivery of liquid milk in the local area within a  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:03):**  few hours. As well as the milk from his dairy herd, Dean and his team invited a range of  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:11):**  other local artisan producers to add their products to the delivery service, creating  
**[0:08:17-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:17):**  a new network of producers who had a market again. Then we skimmed whole milk and also  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:27):**  double cream and whipping cream. Tonight's deliveries are sitting there ready already.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:32):**  We will be able to do our doorstep deliveries tonight at approximately six o'clock.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:36):**  We're going to need 30 salmon and truffles. So how...  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:47):**  Well I've got 12 at North Clontien. That's 30 cows, you need five more? Right.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:08:56):**  We're going to do a door to doorstep milk delivery service in the evening time so your  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:04):**  workload then starts again from sort of five o'clock to ten, eleven o'clock, whatever time  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:09):**  that goes on to. So it's not... lockdown changed our working day quite a lot. We were just  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:16):**  making cheese so sort of we could plan our day quite simply but now you can't plan for  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:20):**  the way other people are thinking. I don't think anybody anticipated what came  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:25):**  down the track at us in March of this year. And I suppose I have a saying for that, you  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:31):**  know, we can't change the direction of the wind but we can adjust the sails.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:38):**  We brought all our products in not only for the consumer but also in support of those  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:44):**  local producers that were in the same position as ourselves that maybe lost a lot of their  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:50):**  business but didn't have the avenue or the conduit to take it to the consumer. So we  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:09:56):**  thought why don't we help the other businesses and also provide good quality high end foods  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:03):**  to the customer base that we have taking milk. Why should they not get fresh strawberries,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:08):**  bacon, bread, apple juice? And these things are all made locally by good business colleagues  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:14):**  and friends that we have here. So why would we not all got together and try to help each  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:19):**  other and I think that's what it was. It was about helping each other as well as taking  
**[0:10:22-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:22):**  another good quality food to the consumer.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:42):**  Us being in direct contact with the end user who is the consumer, this is a very nice place  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:48):**  to be. We need to react to their needs. What do they want to eat? What is the new foods?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:54):**  I think this is a really fun part of this business.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:10:56):**  We have had probably about 500% growth year on year.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:00):**  Gosh! I'm not surprised.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:01):**  And London has done very well. The Queen eats this every week.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:05):**  She does not.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:06):**  She does, yeah.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:07):**  For goodness sake!  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:08):**  So Portland and Mason will probably be our biggest customer.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:09):**  Blimey, that's brilliant to say.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:10):**  So how long have you been going?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:11):**  Two years.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:12):**  Two years?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:13):**  Good.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:14):**  It's all good.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:15):**  Oh yes, brilliant. And I love Robert on the hill there. He's a great man for bringing  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:24):**  new stuff.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:25):**  I would say he's probably, on a pro-rata basis, one of our best customers. But how nice is  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:30):**  that on him, our local grocer?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:32):**  I know, that's right. But you know, it takes people to bring something new. People are  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:37):**  looking for decent quality.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:38):**  I am very proud of the people who do eat our food on a daily basis. Our closest neighbours,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:45):**  people within 10 mile radius, people within Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland, Europe,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:50):**  UK, the Queen, whoever it may be. Every customer is a valued customer.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:11:55):**  Absolutely brilliant. We'll get through that in no time.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:00):**  Some more-ish.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:01):**  Make sure and tamper it well before you eat it.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:04):**  Oh right.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:05):**  Is this boy out of the bath?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:06):**  Yes. He was a bad dog and rolled with something not very good.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:10):**  These are some of the really nice moments that you get in business. Dear Mr Dean Wright,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:15):**  both my wife and I want to thank you and your colleagues for giving us something wonderful  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:20):**  in the midst of the pandemic. We bought a round of your Bellyless Triple Rose cheese  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:26):**  and it is truly wonderful. We have travelled throughout France and Italy and your cheese  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:32):**  is as good, if not better, than we have ever eaten on our adventures. Thank you so much  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:39):**  for creating another great memory as we finish our round of cheese with crusty bread, a good  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:46):**  red wine over the next few days. Stay safe.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:50):**  What an amazing bit of post to open for somebody to take the time. Those are the really inspiring  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:12:56):**  things of the journey that people can actually go to a shop, buy a card and take the time  
**[0:13:00-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:00):**  to write it and put a stamp on it and take it to a post box.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:18):**  I take a lot of pleasure when I'm feeding people, cooking for them, talking about food,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:23):**  saying like this chicken was doing this, was eating this and this is why it tastes like  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:27):**  that. Flavours, taste is such a big expression of the diversity and in my opinion the bounty  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:34):**  of creation.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:38):**  My name is Mohsen Hassanin. I am a farmer in South Wales who has an interest in regenerative  
**[0:13:45-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:45):**  agriculture and permaculture and being proactive in the fight for food sovereignty. It's my  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:54):**  life's work really.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:56):**  Mohsen lives with his family at an old farm in the Welsh valleys.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:13:59):**  Tirwen Vach Farm or otherwise known as Tirwen Farm. I've just practised saying that name  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:05):**  only, that's it, I don't speak Welsh or anything you know. There are a few different translations  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:10):**  but I think it means small yew house. So like that's the little farm with the yew tree but  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:16):**  I renamed it Harmony Farm just to make it easy.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:20):**  He moved to Wales from London where he'd spent a decade in the fundraising business.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:23):**  It was a cushy job and it was really easy and I got paid a nice amount of money to not  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:28):**  do too much stressful work but I got comfortable.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:32):**  Over those years his growing interest in nutrition and health, in the slow food movement and  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:37):**  permaculture practices began to take up more and more of his time.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:41):**  That's all I read and all I looked on YouTube like in my lunch time I'll be just looking  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:46):**  at farms and stuff and I thought this is what I want to do, this is it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:49):**  The countryside was beckoning.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:52):**  We've had over 300 people come up to the farm since we opened up for like unofficial visitors,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:14:57):**  you know friends and family. So yes there is encouragement from our community.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:02):**  Mohsen lives with his wife and four children and they eat the farm's produce. He's fascinated  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:08):**  by the overlaps between regenerative methods of producing food and the insights of his  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:12):**  Islamic faith.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:15):**  This idea of permaculture fitted perfectly because it's the ethics, the element of the  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:19):**  ethics inside permaculture so fair share and people care. That it just completely superimposed  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:26):**  perfectly onto our philosophy of what we were, you know our spiritual goals. It's very closely  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:31):**  linked to the Sufi understanding of Islam. Within that is a big thing about service to  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:36):**  the community and transforming yourself through service.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:40):**  This lady from our community went out to Australia and she said something so powerful she came  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:44):**  back and she said I went all the way to Australia to realise that turning off a tap is not about  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:49):**  saving water. And you know something that just sticks in your head forever and what  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:15:55):**  that was is that it's about being proactive. It's not about a result, it's about being  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:00):**  proactive kind of thing. That was how permaculture was introduced to me and then my teacher specifically  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:06):**  my spiritual teacher was very encouraging of it.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:09):**  Mohsen is one of the business partners running Abraham's, a butcher and retailer of high  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:13):**  welfare organic halal meat and poultry. They have a strong customer base across the country.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:19):**  But the arrival of the pandemic brought uncertainty.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:23):**  We had no inclination of which way it was going to go. We caught on when the orders  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:27):**  came in thick and fast and that was it. We were like this is going to be mad. You know  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:31):**  when people say Christmas come early that kind of implies that you're excited and happy  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:35):**  but when Christmas comes we're scared. We're worried about business, we're worried about  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:41):**  you know pushing it too far, making sure that the staff are you know resourced properly.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:46):**  Actually Christmas came early with COVID but it shocked us as well. It was just flat out  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:51):**  for three months and we had like Christmas week every week for like three months. It  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:16:56):**  just was just nuts. We had people waiting three weeks for meat and stuff. So quite difficult  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:02):**  to manage but at the same time we realised that there's a lot more customers out there  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:07):**  that want to interact with this. I think sometimes it was an availability issue like I had people  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:12):**  asking me look I can't find meat. There's no meat in the halal shop and they're trying  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:16):**  to charge, they're just profiteering so I might as well just buy from you because you've  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:20):**  kept your prices the same but it's cheaper than what these profiteering people are doing  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:25):**  or in my area. So we had a lot of that. We had like you know hundreds of more customers  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:30):**  come on board on the website. You know lots of people buying, trying and so on and so  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:34):**  forth. So I reckon we increased business you know maybe a hundred percent for that time,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:39):**  maybe even 200 percent but at the same time we weren't ready for that. The Coria network  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:44):**  broke down because of the pressure that they were under. There was so much logistics in  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:49):**  it and it's all about not running before you can walk.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:51):**  Asalamu alaikum everyone. My business partner contacted me yesterday and asked me to shoot  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:17:57):**  a little video to kind of maybe deal with some of the worry and the fear that a lot  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:02):**  of customers have expressed. I did a video, a small video, it's called Corona situation  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:07):**  and it was just like put out in the newsletter to just give people reassurance that we're  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:11):**  not going to raise our prices, we're going to get your meat to you, the meat is out there,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:14):**  we've got access to it. I think we got a lot of customers from that. He said to the farmers  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:21):**  look we're going to pay you you know what you want and they had respect for us and they  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:26):**  said we're not going to raise our prices just because we can. So we had this relationship  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:31):**  with them. We've limited our chickens on the website now you can buy three I think that's  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:36):**  the amount that can buy because people are panic buying basically and we had to stop  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:40):**  that because it's not fair. We can't hoard. We've seen a lot of people asking questions  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:48):**  that they weren't asking before and I think this is indicative of the broader situation  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:52):**  where people have been interacting with farmers more. I think that the statistic that I read  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:18:56):**  was that 8 million people bought directly from farms during Covid. There was definitely  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:04):**  an explicit awakening and I had text messages after text messages, phone calls after phone  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:09):**  calls of people asking me these questions and what I saw from friends who I've been  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:16):**  friends with a long time they started to think where is my food coming from. Even though  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:21):**  I've been plugging it to them and talking to them for ages they started to really ask  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:25):**  that question how food is flying all over the place just to get to us like how much  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:31):**  they depend on Spain for example for fruits and vegetables. This really kind of clicked  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:36):**  with a lot of people I think and the Muslim community you know one of the whole things  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:41):**  about choosing the faith of Islam or being brought up in the faith of Islam is the idea  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:44):**  of justice like you cannot have this exploitation going on and I think that kind of opened up  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:51):**  people's eyes.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:19:57):**  The American poet and farmer Gary Snyder writes about the interconnectedness and interdependence  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:02):**  of the food chain as being a kind of big potlatch we're all members of. He adds to acknowledge  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:09):**  that each of us at the table will eventually be part of the meal is not just being realistic,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:14):**  it is allowing the sacred to enter and accepting the sacramental aspect of our shaky, temporary,  
**[0:20:22-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:22):**  personal being.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:30):**  This growing consciousness around food that Mohsen identifies, it seems to be about being  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:35):**  present and aware, being reverent and grateful. These are central tenets of the idea of halal  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:41):**  meat. As well as farming, Mohsen works part time as a halal slaughterman in a local abattoir.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:48):**  I walk into the slaughterhouse, I tell them I'm here, they then make a break in the line,  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:20:55):**  which is basically a wash down and a clean up and a get ready for halal. I then slaughter  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:00):**  the birds the exact same way as the last person has, which is basically a stun bath and then  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:06):**  a bleed out, FSA certified, no issues whatsoever, there's no difference. The only difference  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:11):**  is that I'm conscious of it, I'm conscious of God and I make that intention when I'm  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:17):**  slaughtered. So for my community, they want someone who is Muslim to kill their animals  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:21):**  for them and be conscious of that. And that's what halal is in its kind of loosest terms.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:26):**  I've taken over from someone and I could smell alcohol in his breath, this is like  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:30):**  four o'clock in the morning or five o'clock in the morning. And then I've just probed  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:35):**  and questioned in a very gentle way and he's actually expressed to me that he suffers from  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:42):**  this and he needs to drink to cope with it. And I don't need to do that. Okay, yes, I'm  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:49):**  not there full time. But the reality is that I'm serving my community and that transcends  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:21:55):**  that effect that killing multiple animals will have on the spirit. So that's one side  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:00):**  of it. The second thing is, it's actually a duty within the Islamic tradition. And one  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:04):**  of the most strong sayings of the Prophet is if you slaughter, slaughter well, make  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:09):**  sure you sharpen your knife. And this hadith or saying of the Prophet is about implementation  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:14):**  of Ihsan or perfection in your actions. This idea that every single action, you have to  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:21):**  do it perfectly on this earth. And that's what your purpose is. So it drives this mindfulness  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:25):**  and purposefulness of what you're doing. So when I approach the animal, especially on  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:30):**  farm on farm, I've many times tears have come into my eyes, but I've also understood how  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:35):**  important it is what I'm doing. This animal has to be killed in the right way. And I'm  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:40):**  the right man for the job. You know, I've even read an article about a vegan slaughter  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:44):**  woman, irrespective of religion, but she's purpose driven. She said, I don't eat animals,  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:49):**  but I know I'm very good at killing them quickly. So I should be the person who does it, you  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:22:53):**  know, being the person who's in a conscious state. This is reverence in itself. And then  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:00):**  you take on the next level where you're actually praising God. So you're being grateful at  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:06):**  that time. So the phrase that is said is Bismillah wa Allahu Akbar. And Bismillah means in the  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:11):**  name of God and Allahu Akbar means great. And what you do is you elevate the animal  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:17):**  and you then elevate yourself and your spirit to deal with that harsh reality of taking  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:21):**  life. I've killed a cow on my own farm. And I cried very big tears when I killed her on  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:27):**  this farm. And my son had to actually console me. Like he had to say, you know, and he went  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:31):**  through that. And he when he described the event the other day, and it was like it was  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:36):**  a photographic memory. He literally didn't miss a detail. It was amazing. He was seven  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:40):**  years old. Blood was I was, you know, blood was pouring on my knees and I was crying next  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:45):**  to this cow. That for me is what is missing from our understanding of our connection with  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:23:52):**  meat. I took so much pride feeding a family the other day where I said that fat has been  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:01):**  rendered from an animal that has lived five minutes away. And that's what we're using  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:07):**  to cook with. I didn't have to fly in any oil from any country. I didn't have to process  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:11):**  any oil to localize the food to be close to your food. This is the only way forward if  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:16):**  you want to live that conscious way, I think, because you're going to get stuck in the global  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:20):**  system and COVID has exposed that. 100 years ago, you knew the guy who killed the cow,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:28):**  you knew the farmer, but now it's like packaged up and sent to you. This idea of Ta'ib, previously  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:33):**  when the scholars looked at it, it was talking about how you knew the person who grew the  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:38):**  wheat so you can understand that the bread was coming from a conscious place. But that  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:42):**  doesn't even exist now. Embedded in that is dignity, because it's about that person being  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:47):**  given the dignity to work, the dignity to express himself in his work. He's given a  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:52):**  fair price. I think dignity and justice are completely embedded anyway, because people's  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:24:57):**  dignity will not be given unless there is justice. You don't just take because someone  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:03):**  says to you is good. Yeah, make your own stuff, make your own creams, make your own beauty  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:08):**  products. I even made my own raw milk baby formula for my twins. Like take charge of  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:13):**  yourself. You cannot just be a consumer, you've got to produce. You've got to be a creator  
**[0:25:19-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:19):**  rather than a consumer. My favourite time of year I think is possibly  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:28):**  spring and early summer. Crops are planted, grass is growing, things are changing, you're  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:33):**  coming out of the doldrums of the winter. How does food get to the table? What happens  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:37):**  to your food before it arrives on the shelf of any deli counter? How many decisions have  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:44):**  got to be made before that food gets there? Now here's us, we're checking the weather  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:49):**  on an hourly basis. Well I watched Dorothy last night and it gives Sunday quite a good  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:25:55):**  day. It goes to Sunday Chloe. Yeah it gives Sunday quite a good day. On Monday. No it  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:01):**  doesn't give Monday a good day. There's a 50% chance of rain at 10 o'clock on Monday  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:05):**  morning but either we mow the grass tomorrow on Sunday and lift it on Monday and Tuesday  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:10):**  and I say to Christopher would he lift a bit of it? And we lift a half of it and he lifts  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:15):**  a half of it. We need three dry days in a row without rain because the aspect of what  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:19):**  we're trying to do is cut this grass and let it naturally dry so to concentrate the sugars  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:25):**  in the grass without putting natural water into the pit of grass because what you're  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:30):**  doing is actually diluting the sugar content. I foresee this being a hard few days. I don't  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:35):**  think there'll be much sleep had in the next three to four days. I think it'll probably  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:38):**  be day and night. For loads of farmers I think all the farmers across the UK have probably  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:43):**  been experiencing the same climatic conditions. We're really running very late in the year.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:50):**  We run the risk of actually losing harvest at this point in time and this is where the  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:54):**  challenges in agriculture comes. Is there enough feed to feed the animals? Is there  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:26:57):**  enough grain for bread and all this type of stuff? So yes and whatever the shortfall may  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:02):**  be in terms of grain will be imported from other countries but we go back to sustainability.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:09):**  The climate has become very unpredictable because I think we're getting into a warmer  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:13):**  climate, into a warmer, wetter climate. When it rains now in, like really when you speak  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:18):**  of Northern Ireland here, when it rains we get more thunderous conditions, more rainstorms  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:24):**  now which are basically doing more harm for us. We control everything in terms of the  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:32):**  precision in the cheese plant because we have the ability to control it. We control nothing  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:38):**  in primary agriculture. Climate is everything. When we're trying to grow grain like wheat  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:42):**  and barley and oats, we're trying to grow grass, we're trying to harvest. Ground conditions  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:48):**  and weather conditions are the determining factor how well we do our job really and which  
**[0:27:53-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:27:53):**  we have no control over. So that's, it's a gamble every day we get up.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:03):**  Hello, Helen Fish. Yes, hi. Yeah, fine thanks, yep.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:19):**  We've explored how the pandemic impacted on the lives and work of two farmers in the meat  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:24):**  and dairy sectors. Now it's time for a story from the seas, fish in the Shetland Isles.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:31):**  That's about 110 miles off the UK mainland or to put it another way, a 14-hour ferry  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:37):**  trip from Aberdeen. My name is John Martin Tulloch. I've lived  
**[0:28:41-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:41):**  in Shetland all my life. I started out at the local boatyard as a joiner and moved into  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:50):**  having a small boat and fishing and now a couple of years down the line I'm director  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:28:55):**  of a company that I set up called Island Fish Shetland Limited. So we supply fish locally  
**[0:29:03-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:03):**  and export as well. The boats fish here generally from one to three days. They land to catch  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:14):**  at either Lerwick or Scallow fish markets and they have an auction each weekday that  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:21):**  starts at eight o'clock in the morning and usually runs on until 10, 11 o'clock where  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:28):**  we can buy the fresh fish. We collect it from either market, take it back to the unit, get  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:36):**  it filleted and then it's for sale. Generally we try and get everything prepared for the  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:42):**  following day. I think that the most popular fish up here is without a doubt haddock. I  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:49):**  think in years gone by then there's a lot of cod up here but that was maybe too valuable  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:29:55):**  to eat because it was all exported. People ate haddock and it's the same today at most  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:03):**  of the sales that go through the shop is for fresh haddock. There's really nobody up here  
**[0:30:09-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:09):**  that eats cod. The fish is certainly abundant up here but I think some of the scientists  
**[0:30:18-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:18):**  maybe see it different. We don't get any sea bass or bream. It's mostly haddock, white  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:27):**  and the ground fish like place, lemon sole and meagrams, hake and turbot and halibut  
**[0:30:34-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:34):**  and monks. Born and bred up here, my family goes back about 500 years with Shetland connections.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:48):**  It's quite idyllic in places. The weather can be quite nice at times and fierce at other  
**[0:30:55-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:30:55):**  times. Really the winter months it's a lot of gales and not much calm spells. I think  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:09):**  the biggest thing to try and get used to if anybody was coming here would be the long  
**[0:31:14-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:14):**  dark nights in the winter time. We were reasonably busy, it was enough to keep us going and then  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:26):**  when we got word of the pandemic and everything was going to be shut down we didn't really  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:31):**  know what was going to happen to the business and really overnight the export market had  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:38):**  died down. The local sales went up massively but the rest in some hotels it was just like  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:45):**  a light switch going off. There were no sales that came through for that. Really I think  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:50):**  to begin with a lot of people were panic buying. We were trying to get more and more fish in  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:31:55):**  to feed the beast I suppose but I think some of the boats they weren't sure what was happening  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:02):**  and some of them wasn't going to go off so they were a big shortage of fish just for  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:08):**  a few days in the very beginning. And then just in the back of that then all the boats  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:13):**  went off and I think with the European market closing down and stuff getting more difficult  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:19):**  to export there were a lot of fish getting landed at the markets but nobody was buying  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:26):**  it so the prices just crashed. Some of the fish wasn't sold but other fish it was just  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:32):**  going for very very cheap. The stuff that's usually exported. The price basically just  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:38):**  crashed and then the boats decided well it's not worth the while going off if that's what  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:43):**  all they're getting so again they were a shortage on the back of that but it seemed to even  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:49):**  sell out some of the boats with half of the Shetland fleet would stay ashore for two weeks  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:32:56):**  of the month while the other half fished and then they swapped the boots so they were controlling  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:01):**  the quantity of fish that was coming in at the time so they got a better price and was  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:06):**  enough to supply the local market. They were all working together and some of the boats  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:12):**  was getting maintenance done so they decided to tie up then and get painted up and other  
**[0:33:17-0:33:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:17):**  maintenance and while half of them was fishing so it worked well. The Shetland companies  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:26):**  they all get on pretty well and I think in general they all try and work together and  
**[0:33:32-0:33:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:32):**  help one another but I think more more noticeable with the Covid situation.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:42):**  Shetland is home to the UK's second largest whitefish landing port and fishing is a huge  
**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:47):**  part of many people's livelihoods. John Martin Tulloch's main market used to be the UK mainland  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:33:54):**  but when the pandemic hit that market disappeared and he had to transform his business.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:01):**  I don't think anybody knew what was going to happen and well we didn't really know what  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:06):**  to do. My initial thought was to close the shop and try and contain the virus so you  
**[0:34:12-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:12):**  weren't spreading it and we decided to close the shop on the Wednesday and we have social  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:20):**  media presence. We put on the social media, we were close to shop but if one of the vehicles  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:28):**  was at the unit then they could just come around to the door and we could supply them  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:33):**  whitefish. So on the Thursday morning there was a knock at the door at I think it was  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:39):**  quarter to ten in the morning and somebody wanting fish and by the time I got them served  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:46):**  there were other people that had arrived and I never got out of the shop until just after  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:52):**  five that night and that was the Thursday. The Friday was the busiest day that we had  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:34:58):**  before we opened and then we decided we were going to close and just do deliveries and  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:05):**  people can book time slots to come and collect. But yeah it was very uncertain what was going  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:12):**  to happen and I think everybody kind of adapted to the circumstances and trying to follow  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:19):**  the rules and tried to stay safe I suppose. The oldest son, he's 15, when the schools  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:26):**  was closed and he was working most days helping me in the shop because we tried to keep it  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:33):**  in the household rather than taking in other employees that would be potentially could  
**[0:35:38-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:38):**  spread the virus. The first few weeks then it was really just me and my wife and kids  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:46):**  all helping in the shop. The smallest girl, she's seven years old, she doesn't collect  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:51):**  fish but what we did was for doing our deliveries she did drawings and stay safe with a rainbow  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:35:58):**  or something and then we'd put that in to random bags and put out for delivery. So the  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:05):**  people that got the delivery of fish would notice this drawing in it and they would put  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:10):**  it up in their windows. When we did do our deliveries the next time then we could see  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:14):**  Laura, that's her name, her picture up in the windows. And she would decorate it, paint  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:21):**  it, scallop shells and we put that in to different people's orders. So it was just to try and  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:27):**  brighten the atmosphere a bit and lift people's spirits. So that was her job and make him,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:33):**  at least the middle boy, he was 12. He was helping back fish and just helping out generally.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:41):**  And Willem, he was helping me process some of the fish. So yeah, it was certainly a family  
**[0:36:46-0:36:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:46):**  thing to begin with for the first few weeks. We're supplying local produce as well in the  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:36:54):**  shop. A lot of the people new in Shetland are trying to source local produce, whether  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:00):**  it's fish or beef, eggs, vegetables, anything, try and get it locally if they can. There  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:07):**  is a change. We certainly have a bigger customer base now as before the lockdown. It's nice,  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:15):**  you get a bit of satisfaction if you either catch your own fish or supply fresh fish from  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:21):**  local boats and sell it locally. And for people to come back and say they really enjoyed your  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:29):**  fish and you get a bit of a boost to that. But when you ship fish away, you really don't  
**[0:37:35-0:37:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:35):**  get much feedback. We tried to diversify and see what the needs of the people and the community  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:44):**  was and just changed how we sold fish to make it more accessible to people that was self-isolating  
**[0:37:52-0:38:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:37:52):**  and that type of thing. We've actually been busier for the lockdown doing deliveries and  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:00):**  people coming to pick up fish. In some ways it's been good for us, but things will change  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:06):**  again and we'll have to adapt and just see how people want to buy it, whether it's maybe  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:12):**  even move to online selling and be able to ship through the UK. I think things will change  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:19):**  again but I think the biggest thing that we see is people wanting to buy local produce  
**[0:38:25-0:38:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:25):**  more. You look at the whole pandemic, you know, what has it taught us? Life's very precious  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:36):**  and I think the farming community don't enjoy life as well as they should do. I think they  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:41):**  see it as a seven day a week job, a 20 hour a day job. You know, it shouldn't be like  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:48):**  that, it should be like any other business, but unfortunately there's not the money in  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:38:52):**  primary agriculture to invest in labour to give people a life. It's no wonder that the  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:00):**  average age of the farmer in Northern Ireland is 58. You know, why is there no young people  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:04):**  coming into the business? Nine to five farmer, have we ever seen one? No we haven't. You  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:09):**  know, I sometimes joke when I say, ah no I didn't do very much today on a Sunday, but  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:13):**  I still work eight hours. I think that's where Northern Ireland differs from other regions  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:18):**  in the UK, that it's not seen to be a professional job, it's like a way of life. And I think  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:25):**  that's where the farming community need to, they need to have quality of life as well  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:30):**  to enjoy family time. This has taught me a lot about family time and that's where I think  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:36):**  the succession planning in our farm, there is some debate hanging over it, you know,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:40):**  is there another generation that's going to come on and take the farm on? When you look  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:45):**  at the years and years or decades ago, then people just had their crofts and their small  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:51):**  fishing boat and they went off and they caught their fish and they had a few sheep and maybe  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:39:56):**  a cow to get milk and they were very sufficient. They didn't need things like washing machines  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:04):**  and they always seemed to be very busy but they always had time to speak. And now in  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:11):**  the modern world everybody buys things to save time like dishwashers and washing machines  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:16):**  and cars and they seem to have a lot less time to speak to their neighbours because  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:21):**  they have to work so much to pay for all this things that saves time. It's a funny one to  
**[0:40:28-0:40:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:28):**  think about. On the farm here we have a building that was an old creamery that was built in  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:48):**  1920, 1930. I would need to look at the old deeds in the wartime. That was vested off  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:53):**  us by the British government to bottle the milk from the local farms for the local areas  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:40:59):**  here and there's real history in that building. The stonework is absolutely impeccable in  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:04):**  it. The next development of the process inside of our business is that we will put a vending  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:09):**  machine into that building. We are moving back in time a hundred years. I think it's  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:14):**  bringing history back to the fore that this is what the building was built for. To provide  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:18):**  milk for the local community and that's what we're going to do again. People can come and  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:22):**  bring their own bottles, fill them up, take them away and return as frequently as they  
**[0:41:26-0:41:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:26):**  like. You know the old ways were certainly maybe not the worst ways in the world. The  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:44):**  pandemic has probably taught us a lot of things. Where does our food come from? How far has  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:48):**  it travelled? The journey, the animal, the land, the atmosphere. Is that food produced  
**[0:41:54-0:42:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:41:54):**  in a dignified fashion? In the next episode of Who Feeds Us, we hear from people who are  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:11):**  coming together to grow their own and in doing so reclaiming collective control of urban  
**[0:42:17-0:42:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:17):**  space, of seeds and of our idea of what's possible. This episode was produced by Phil  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:27):**  Smith. The executive producers of Who Feeds Us are Joe Barrett, Abbey Rose and me, Katie  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:33):**  Revel. Col Gordon, Zane Dada and Fern Towers worked with us as community collaborators  
**[0:42:40-0:42:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:40):**  to unearth the stories of John Martin Tulloch, Mohsen Hassanin and Dean Wright. The project  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:42:47):**  manager for Who Feeds Us is Olivia Oldham. Our artwork is by Hannah Grace and the original

**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:16):**  the team together. I said to my kids the other day, I used to say, whenever you say to me  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:23):**  what's your favourite animal, I always say a lion because you know, courage and all that  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:26):**  kind of stuff and just, but now I tell them I'm a beaver. They build back the rivers and  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:31):**  they build back the ecosystem by doing the right actions. The beaver spirit, yeah, the  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:37):**  regenerative action of a beaver and what he does to a river is what I want to take on  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-land-animal-journey#t=0:43:41):**  and be on my farm and be for the community as well.

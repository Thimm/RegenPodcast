**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:24):**  And your particular interest is on using the wood or the effect it has on the soil, plus  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:32):**  the, what's the draw for you?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:35):**  Me, I think there wasn't really one. I mean, it's a further outlet for wood chip. You know,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:42):**  if this goes absolutely crazy and everybody decides they want to put wood chip on their  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:46):**  land, we're going to be selling a lot more wood chip. You know, so to my, my work wasn't  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:52):**  driven by any sort of ethical considerations. It was literally a proposition. You know,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:08:58):**  would you like to do this? Yeah, why not? It's interesting.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:02):**  But equally, you were talking earlier as we were going around the farm about, you know,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:06):**  you've been putting green waste compost on your land for a number of years and seeing  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:09):**  the benefit of that.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:10):**  Oh yes, yes, yes. No, no, so to that extent, we're sort of, yeah, in the train. But I mean,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:16):**  obviously you can see the amount of compost we're getting through dwarfs, probably, any  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:23):**  likely application of wood chip. And it's not that difficult, but you'd have to sort  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:29):**  of set out to do it. You know, so, you know, I just ring up Sam who's got the tree shear  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:34):**  and he comes out and does a shipper shearing. Well, I think now there are lots of tree shears  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:39):**  out there, so that's more difficult.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:40):**  So anyone could do that?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:41):**  And then the chipper, well, a lot of our own customers here have got little Timberwolf  
**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:48):**  chippers and you don't need a huge industrial chipper to produce chip from, you know, the  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:09:56):**  Ramion chip because it's small diameter by definition. You know, it's not that you couldn't  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:01):**  do it, but you sort of think, now do I know anybody with a chipper? You do not know anybody.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:06):**  And have I got the right kind of muck spreader? And, you know, it's that kind of inertia,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:12):**  I guess, for a man who hasn't considered it before. He'd have to figure out where he was  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:19):**  going to get it. I mean, you could hire them.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:21):**  Yeah, but it's always making a bit easier for him to make that decision.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:24):**  Just exactly that. And I mean, I think the cost of spreading that wood chip was sort  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:28):**  of 40 quid or something.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:30):**  Minimum, yeah.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:31):**  Because, you know, they had that enormous FGS spreader in the field anyway, and it was  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:36):**  just, you know, chuck a bucket in there and off we go. Well, bring it on, see what happens.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:41):**  But if you have to manage your hedges and you're coppicing your hedges, you've got to  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:44):**  do something with the material that comes off them. So if you've got a grant, you've  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:47):**  got your hedges in a state where they need that rejuvenation work, so they need that  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:51):**  coppicing. So then you get a grant from the government subsidy to coppice them. You've  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:56):**  got to do something with the material. So you either push it all up and burn it, which  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:10:59):**  is what one of the contractors that we know in Suffolk who coppices hedges used to do.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:04):**  Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, that would be the standard. I'm sure my neighbour, you know, two farms  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:07):**  over did just that, you know, which they haven't even burned it. But of course, it's not much  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:15):**  money, so it probably wouldn't have been worth sort of saying, I can take that because with  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:20):**  the time you've gone and got it and done everything. So I think there's a sort of a bit of a hearts  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:27):**  and minds. You'd have to want to do it, I think. But if you, you know, I mean, a bit  
**[0:11:32-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:32):**  of proper data justifying the benefits. You know, I think farmers in general do care about  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:41):**  their soil. And we're seeing, I think, a new younger generation of farmer coming forward  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:49):**  who is much more interested in the scientific aspects of it. You know, some of them are  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:54):**  not, some of them are just sort of same old, same old. But some of the answers coming forward  
**[0:11:59-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:11:59):**  are really inquisitive. And, you know, I would say they're susceptible.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah, we've had quite a lot of interest in the project, definitely.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:12):**  And William, you're the forestry side.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:14):**  I've come in on the forestry side, but also as a running of the Woodfield cooperative  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:20):**  meant that I had the wood chip angle up my sleeve. And Sally brought me in really to  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:26):**  look at the hedgerow management plans. And that takes an overall view of the farmholding  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:34):**  as a whole and what wood resources there are. And that gave you an idea of what productive  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:41):**  potential there is. And hopefully this trial will bring out the costs and the benefits  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:49):**  of using the wood chip either on the soil or otherwise into the fuel chain and the cost  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:12:58):**  savings in the management of the hedgerows, which can be balanced against it.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:02):**  Because you've got to do something with the hedges anyway.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:04):**  Exactly. So it's going to be very interesting at the end of the project as to how these  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:09):**  economics work out and whether the soil health benefits tip the balance one way or another.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:17):**  It's going to be very interesting. But on a conventional arable farm such as Robert's,  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:22):**  I think the risks are relatively small.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:25):**  It'll be interesting to see the soil results tracked over the next couple of years. Certainly  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:32):**  with the yield mapping on the barley last year, you couldn't make out the plots. You  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:35):**  couldn't see any difference.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:36):**  So we're at the end of March 2019 at the moment. The first year of trials was last year?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:43):**  First year of trials was last year. So first year of data. And then second year of trials  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:47):**  has just been set up this winter. So we'll get three years of data off the first year  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:52):**  of trial, two years of data off the second year of trial. We can put it all together,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:13:55):**  come up with a good picture hopefully.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:07):**  Fred Price of Gothany Farm in Somerset was on the show back in January, telling us about  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:12):**  his journey from a chemical arable operation to something much more regenerative. We wanted  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:19):**  to hear a bit more about a key part of his system, the pastured pigs.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:25):**  Most people associate pigs with mud and lots of rooting around. But Fred has found that  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:30):**  by using herbal lathes and moving the pigs on, they can also be very happy on pasture.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:36):**  His aim on his farm is to build soil health, and the pigs are a brilliant way to do that  
**[0:14:41-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:41):**  whilst ensuring the farm is financially and ecologically resilient.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:50):**  How I started, well my grandfather was an industrial pig farmer, I guess you'd call  
**[0:14:54-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:14:54):**  it. So all indoors and kind of intensively reared and the breeding was different as well.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:15:07):**  Now we rear Tamworth, which is a rare breed, which gives us the slow growing characteristics  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:15:12):**  that we need. And we're all breeding and rearing as outdoors on herbal lathes, cover crops  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:15:19):**  over the winter. And kind of taking mob grazing beef systems as our ultimate inspiration for  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:15:27):**  how we want to, where we want to get to, of how dynamic we want to be moving the pigs.

**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:15:37):**  but straw based at the moment. And we want to get to a point where, again, it's about

**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:01):**  on the straw, we want to be delivering them a forage based diet. So that's, if you were

**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:12):**  based as I believe I can push a pig at this point in time with what we know.

**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:23):**  means and is, and how you started to realize that was possible?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:27):**  I guess a lot of people would say, oh, well we put pigs outside on grass and they just  
**[0:16:31-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:31):**  root it all up. I guess I was interested in diversity of cropping and so I was looking  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:40):**  at herbal lays from a kind of arable farmer's perspective in what I wanted to do above ground  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:47):**  reflected the diversity of life below ground. So we were looking at herbal lays, diverse  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:52):**  species cover crops, and the way that the pigs graze, particularly if you manage them  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:16:59):**  properly, but A, just what species you put in front of them and at what time of year  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:03):**  you're putting it in front of them. They will behave, they will graze. If you just leave  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:09):**  them in one area all year, they'll graze first and then they'll start rooting out. But if  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:13):**  you can move them and be more dynamic with how you operate, then yeah, they will graze.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:19):**  Can you tell me a little bit about exactly how your system works currently?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:24):**  So we have three groups of eight sows and they are on a six month cycle. So we wean  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:32):**  at two months old and there's a four month gestation, then they go back to pig straight  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:36):**  away and they're all two months apart. So basically every two months we're weaning about  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:41):**  60, a batch of 60 weaners. And then from two months to six months, the weaners will stay  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:48):**  outside and then between six months old and 10 months old, they'll come into the roundhouse  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:53):**  and the weaners will be fed on a TMR diet. So we grow a lot of Lucerne silage on the  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:17:59):**  farm and that forms about 55, 60% of the TMR, which stands for total mixed ration. And then  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:06):**  30% rolled barley, which we grow on the farm and 15% beans. And then there's a small mineral  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:12):**  supplement, but that's effectively that mineral supplement is the only thing we buy in on  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:16):**  the farm. So the pigs is a nice, totally closed system really.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:21):**  And what about some of them spend some time in forests?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah, well, we've got what I would have perceived dead areas before 10 years ago. And now they  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:32):**  can be super high welfare areas for the pigs to use, particularly in the summer when grass  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:40):**  growth is slower. So you've got more of the undergrowth and also the shading of all the  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:45):**  trees for the pigs. So we use them as sporadically as we can because I feel if you can use a  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:51):**  small area of woodland for two months of the year and then let it regenerate for 10, you're  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:55):**  getting a lot more out of your two months than you would if you used it for six months  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:18:59):**  of the year. But you know, practicality dictates we generally use it for longer than two months.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:03):**  But ultimately we want to get to the point where we can just drop in and drop out much  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:07):**  more sparingly. I think it's too easy to come to the farm and say, oh, look, Fred's doing  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:12):**  rare breed pigs, isn't this, you know, nice premium product and all that. The only reason  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:17):**  we have pigs here on the farm and the reason our pig system looks like it does is to some  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:24):**  extent to produce a quality pork product. But it's also to pay for the more progressive  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:31):**  aspects of our farming system. Things like perennial crops, mixed species lays, cover  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:39):**  crops over winter. I can now walk out onto those more progressive aspects to our system  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:44):**  and be very happy that they're generating a four to five hundred pound a hectare profit  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:49):**  in the same way that five or six years ago I would have had to go out into a tabletop  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:19:54):**  wheat crop, high input, you know, milling wheat to find that kind of profit. So now  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:00):**  we have a really regenerative system where the truly regenerative parts of it are actually

**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:08):**  in the room with regenerative farming is we all know the compelling biological case for

**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:20):**  if you don't make adjustments in how you run your business, it's very difficult to achieve

**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:32):**  the pigs really offer that opportunity to set my farm gate price, know my yield and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:40):**  also know my input costs and decide how I want to grow those inputs. And we grow them  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:46):**  with low inputs. So we don't use fungicides, we don't use insecticides and we don't use  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:20:51):**  nitrogen and we accept lower yields. But we accept also that it's part of a really progressive

**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:21:03):**  to my pigs and I set my pig price and it all informs this wider story. But that sort of

**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:22:22):**  He talks about barrel compost quite a bit, which is something those in the biodynamic

**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:22:40):**  of other ingredients such as basalt and eggshells added in.

**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:23:02):**  don't want to till our soils because we don't want to break up the microbiological ecosystem  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:23:10):**  within the soil, especially the hyphae. Every time you till, you break up the hyphae and

**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:24:55):**  of water. I prefer to add some mycorrhizae to that, because I think this is a great way  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:01):**  to get mycorrhizae into a perennial system, especially if you didn't have the ability

**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:19):**  create little seed balls. So we plant our cover crop, our perennial cover crops, right  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:26):**  before harvest, because in Oregon it becomes very rainy, or could potentially become very  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:33):**  rainy, any time from last week of September. And the rain could start at that point and  
**[0:25:41-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:41):**  go all the way until May of the next year. In winters, I apply several different compostees.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:25:52):**  I find that here in Oregon, in our climate, we don't get extremely cold. Our temperatures  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:00):**  are usually around 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. And so I find that our soils are the most  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:10):**  active during that time period when we have wet, moist soils. And so I think this is a  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:16):**  great time to add biostimulants and then also biological inoculants. And I choose my biological  
**[0:26:24-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:24):**  inoculants through the biodynamic methods. So I'll spray out 500, preparation 500, and  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:36):**  then also barrel compost. And I also put out an application, or several applications, of  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:43):**  hydrolyzed fish, which is different than a fish emulsion. Hydrolyzed fish is cold processed  
**[0:26:50-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:26:50):**  fish that includes collagen, omega-3 fatty acids. The hydrolyzed fish that I get also  
**[0:27:00-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:00):**  includes crab and shrimp shells, which have chitin in it. Chitin is the primary component  
**[0:27:10-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:10):**  of hyphal cell walls and fungal cell walls. And this is basically a fungus food. And I  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:20):**  spray it out there to help the hyphal network build in our soils.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:27):**  So next, coming into spring, I think one of the main things that we do is we have our  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:36):**  prunings left over from our winter pruning of the vineyard. At that point in time, then  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:41):**  we'll run a tractor through with a mower, a flail mower, and chip them up. So they're  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:48):**  chipped up in place and left in the ground. So that then also becomes food for the microbial  
**[0:27:55-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:27:55):**  community. I also then make another biodynamic preparation pass of the barrel compost. I  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:04):**  think the barrel compost really helps break that down. And then also in combination with  
**[0:28:10-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:10):**  the fish, the hydrolyzed fish that we already put down, creates a real diverse microbial  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:19):**  and strong microbial and fungal community that will then break those prunings down and  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:26):**  make it available to the whole system. Another thing that we do in spring too is we prune  
**[0:28:35-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:35):**  the trees around the periphery of the vineyard and get those for hardwood cuttings. And we  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:44):**  chip those. And I put those wood chips then into the compost pile again to feed the fungal  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:49):**  communities, especially the saprophytic fungi. And in summer, I would say that one of our  
**[0:28:57-0:29:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:28:57):**  more ecological farming practices would include applying compost. And that is actually, I  
**[0:29:07-0:29:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:07):**  guess could be a fall, but that's a post-harvest application of compost.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:19):**  Last month, we responded to one listener's question explaining a bit about the nuances  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:23):**  of no-till in conservation agriculture. Well, this month another listener responded to that  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:29):**  explanation reminding us of a pressing issue in the UK which we didn't mention with regards  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:34):**  to glyphosate use. There are a number of farmers in the UK who not only use glyphosate to burn  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:40):**  off a cover crop in a conservation ag system, but they also use it just before harvesting  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:45):**  their crops. In fact, we read online that almost 80% of oilseed rape in the UK is sprayed  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:52):**  with glyphosate or an alternative herbicide just before harvest. This practice is known  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:29:58):**  as pre-harvest crop desiccation. And I'm not 100% clear on exactly why farmers do it,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:07):**  but from what I understand, it helps to ensure a more uniform crop, particularly in wetter  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:12):**  climates and also many people, or it's often said that it's done in order to dry the crop  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:19):**  out because it essentially kills the crop. But talking to a few different experts, there's  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:26):**  also a lot of evidence out there now that shows that it doesn't actually help to do  
**[0:30:29-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:29):**  that at all and that drying a crop that's been sprayed with glyphosate is actually more  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:37):**  difficult in the end. But anyway, jury's out on that. Many people feel uneasy about this  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:44):**  use of glyphosate as it's applied just before harvesting the crop and therefore is much  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:50):**  more likely to end up in our food system. I do understand why farmers do this, especially  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:30:55):**  those in wetter climates, as it helps to ensure the consistency of their crop. However, I  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:31:01):**  definitely feel very uneasy about this use of herbicides. But I'm always open to hearing  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:31:09):**  more. So if you are a farmer who uses a herbicide in this way, maybe you could get in touch  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/47-women-farmers-in-chile-woodchip-pasture-happy-pigs-and-regenerative-vineyard-management#t=0:31:13):**  and let us know why you do it and what you think about it. Or on the contrary, if you

## Leah Penniman: Farming While Black  
**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this special interview with author, activist and farmer, Leah Penniman.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:14):**  This Farmerama podcast is brought to you by Chelsea Green Publishing and Leah Penniman's  
**[0:00:19-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:19):**  Farming While Black.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:28):**  In 1920, there were 925,000 black farmers owning 16 million acres of land, 14% of the  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:37):**  US farmland.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:38):**  By 1970, 90% of the farmers and the farmland were lost to the black community.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:45):**  It was almost as if the earth was opening up and swallowing black farmers, wrote scholar  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:51):**  Pete Daniel in his book, Dispossession.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:56):**  Leah Penniman's book, Farming While Black, published by Chelsea Green Publishing, invites  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:01):**  us all to look at the history and practice of sustainable agriculture with new eyes.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:08):**  In the words of Malcolm X, revolution is based on land.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:13):**  Land is the basis of all independence.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:16):**  Land is the basis of freedom, justice and equality.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:21):**  Leah's book is a manifesto and a manual, it includes recipes, wisdom from diasporic  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:27):**  African farmers and practical techniques for setting up a small-scale farm.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:33):**  And it's a call to action, because at its core, it's a celebration of people of colour  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:39):**  reclaiming agency in the food system.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:43):**  A key part of this celebration are the songs of the land, and most of the songs featured  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:48):**  in this episode are recordings made by Leah with friends on her farm.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:53):**  I've yet to read any book that centres the black farmer as we.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:58):**  The only books that I've read about us really paint, they're requiems, they're requiems  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:03):**  for us about how we're disappearing, but they're not about how to reclaim that place of agency  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:09):**  in the food system and belonging to the land.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:11):**  So my hope for black farmers is that this is a book that's both an inspiration as well  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:16):**  as a practical manual for finding our way home to our rightful place of dignity on the  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:23):**  land.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:24):**  And my hope for the broader community is that this book is an opportunity to rethink the  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:31):**  narrative we have about the place of black people in sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:38):**  That's an opportunity to give credit where it's due and to uplift the dignity and the  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:42):**  noble contributions of black people to the sustainable farming movement.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:50):**  After midnight on October 4th, 1908, 50 hooded white men surrounded the home of a black farmer  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:58):**  in Hinckman, Kentucky and ordered him to come out for a whipping.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:02):**  When David Walker refused and shot at them instead, the mob poured coal oil on his house  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:08):**  and set it afire, according to contemporary newspaper accounts.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:13):**  Pleading for mercy, Walker ran out the front door followed by four screaming children and  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:18):**  his wife carrying a baby in her arms.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:22):**  The mob shot them all, wounding three children and killing the others.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:26):**  Walker's oldest son never escaped the burning house.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:30):**  No one was ever charged with the killings and the surviving children were deprived of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:34):**  the farm their father died defending.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:37):**  Record records show that Walker's two and a half acre farm was simply folded into the  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:42):**  property of a white neighbor.  
**[0:03:44-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:44):**  The neighbor soon sold it to another man whose daughter owns the undeveloped land today.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:02):**  While farming was initially healing for me, for many African heritage people it is a triggering  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:08):**  and re-traumatizing experience.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:11):**  Almost without exception, when I ask black visitors to Soul Fire Farm what they first  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:15):**  associate with farming, they respond, slavery or plantation.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:21):**  As Chris Bolden Newsom says, the field was the scene of the crime.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:25):**  Hundreds of years of enslavement have devastated our sacred connection to land and overshadowed  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:31):**  thousands of years of our noble autonomous farming history.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:36):**  Many of us have confused the terror our ancestors experienced on land with the land herself,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:41):**  naming her the oppressor and running toward paved streets without looking back.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:47):**  We do not stoop, sweat, harvest or even get dirty because we imagine that would revert  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:53):**  us to bondage.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:55):**  And yet we are keenly aware that something is missing, that a gap exists where once there  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:59):**  was connection.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:02):**  This generation of black people is becoming known as the returning generation of agrarian  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:06):**  people.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:07):**  Our grandparents fled the red clays of Georgia and we are now cautiously working to make  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:13):**  sense of a reconciliation with lands.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:16):**  We somehow know that without the lands we cannot return to freedom.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:25):**  Farming found me by accident.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:27):**  I was always a young person who felt deeply connected to nature because the forest was  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:32):**  a friend and solace when my peers in school certainly were anything but.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:38):**  So when it came time to get my first job as a teenager, I saw a flyer for the food project  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:43):**  at my mom's church and went for the interview and was lucky enough to land a position where  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:50):**  my role was to do things like harvest cilantro and prepare soups for people without houses  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:57):**  and folks experiencing domestic violence.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:00):**  And that elegant simplicity of planting and reaping and providing food for the community  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:06):**  was a beautiful antidote to all the confusion and identity crises and wondering if I belonged  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:12):**  of my teenage years.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:15):**  When I wasn't farming there was a way that my thoughts and my heart would be swirling  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:20):**  in confusion.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:21):**  I would be wondering, you know, is life really worth living?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:25):**  Am I going to be successful?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:27):**  Do I belong?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:28):**  Does anyone care about me?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:30):**  So all of these thoughts would always be consuming me.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:32):**  But as soon as I started farming, as soon as I was in contact with the soil or even  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:36):**  when I was preparing food for people who needed it in the Boston community, that chatter quieted  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:42):**  down.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:43):**  There was an undeniable good to the work, an undeniable meaning to the work.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:49):**  And by logical extension, if this thing that my hands could do meant something to the world,  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:55):**  then I must also mean something to the world.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:58):**  So it was not just about learning the skills of farming, but it was very much about healing  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:02):**  my sense of purpose and worth as a teen.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:06):**  I can feel my heartbeat beating to the rhythm of the freedom song.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:14):**  If I say yes to the beating in me, I can set my spirit free.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:19):**  I can feel my heartbeat beating to the rhythm of the freedom song.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:24):**  If I say yes to the beating in me, I can set my spirit free.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:30):**  Leah has been farming for over 20 years and she's moved through a lot of ups and downs  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:35):**  in that time.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:37):**  She now lives and works at Soul Fire Farm, a place with community at its core.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:43):**  Soul Fire Farm also found us in many ways.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:47):**  We were living then in the south end of Albany, which is classified as a food desert by the  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:52):**  United States Department of Agriculture, which means that it's a high poverty census track  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:57):**  and also a place where there aren't grocery stores or farmers markets.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:01):**  So my partner Jonah and I were living there with our very young children.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:06):**  Nishima was two and Emmett was a newborn.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:09):**  And despite our years of farming experience and our education privilege, we found it very  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:14):**  difficult to find the food we needed to give our children the right kind of nourishment.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:21):**  And so eventually we joined a farm share CSA that cost more than our rent for us and it  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:27):**  was over two miles away.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:29):**  So without a car that meant walking up a hill with a newborn on the back and the two-year-old  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:34):**  in the stroller and then piling all these vegetables on top of the two-year-old and  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:38):**  then going back and preparing the food.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:41):**  And so when our neighbors found out that we knew how to farm, they really encouraged us  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:45):**  to create a farm for the people, meaning to create a farm that would focus on getting  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:51):**  fresh vegetables and food to our neighbors and to folks who were excluded from the benefits  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:56):**  of the food system.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:58):**  We always knew we wanted to have a farm one day, but that was a moment of accountability  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:04):**  and mission formation for us.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:07):**  So in speaking with our neighbors in the south end of Albany, it was revealed that there  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:11):**  are really two main barriers to accessing good food.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:16):**  And believe it or not, it has nothing to do with education.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:19):**  It has nothing to do with desire to eat good food.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:22):**  The two barriers are transportation and money.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:27):**  So when we designed our farm share CSA, we decided to deliver the vegetables right to  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:32):**  people's doorstep so folks didn't have to have a car or go somewhere out of their neighborhood  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:37):**  to get the food.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:38):**  That box shows up every Wednesday right where they tell us to leave it.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:41):**  And to address the issue of money while still maintaining financial viability as a farm,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:47):**  which is really important to us, we adopted a sliding scale model, which means that if  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:51):**  you have more, you pay more.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:53):**  If you have less, you pay less.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:55):**  So people choose the amount that they can afford for their vegetables, eggs, sprout,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:00):**  chicken meats.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:01):**  And we don't check anybody's paperwork.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:04):**  It's all based on the honor system.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:07):**  But we found that folks are very generous.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:09):**  So people tend to contribute as much as they possibly can.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:12):**  And we have a number of folks in the community who contribute toward what we call solidarity  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:17):**  shares.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:18):**  So that's when a family pays the full cost of a season-long share for someone who really  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:23):**  can't pay anything at all.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:25):**  And we give away those solidarity shares to refugees, immigrants, and folks impacted by  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:31):**  incarceration and criminal injustice in our community.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:34):**  And we have about 15 people right now who get completely free shares and deliveries.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:41):**  Thank you for this land.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:44):**  Thank you for this land.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:47):**  Thank you for this land.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:50):**  Thank you for this land.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:52):**  This healing, this healing, this healing land.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:58):**  This healing, this healing, this healing land.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:04):**  So even though we drive through some wealthier neighborhoods, we do not stop there to drop  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:10):**  off the boxes.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:11):**  We only do doorstep delivery in zip codes that are USDA food deserts.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:16):**  And we require that folks who are middle and high income get their boxes from those low-income  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:21):**  neighborhoods.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:22):**  First of all, because they can, you know, so it's fair for us to expect that those with  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:27):**  resource use their resource.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:29):**  But also it becomes an awakening moment because for a lot of these higher income families,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:34):**  they don't have the opportunity to visit neighborhoods that experience economic disadvantage.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:42):**  And so it's a reminder about that dichotomy that exists in society and hopefully a catalyst  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:47):**  for both compassion and action.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:50):**  The idea of food deserts is well known, but Leah prefers a different term.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:56):**  Food apartheid is a term that was taught to me by my mentor, Karen Washington of Risen  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:01):**  Root Farm.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:02):**  It refers to the fact that the system we have right now, which relegates certain people  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:07):**  to food opulence and others to food scarcity, really isn't metaphorically a desert because  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:13):**  a desert is a natural phenomenon.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:16):**  It's a biodiversity rich biome.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:19):**  It has a place in the earth, a noble place, whereas apartheid is a human created system  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:25):**  of segregation.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:26):**  And that's really what we have where your zip code, which is very much determined by  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:30):**  a legacy of redlining and racist zoning policies in turn determines your access to food.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:38):**  And there's nothing natural about that.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:39):**  It's a human created system and it can be a system that we dismantle and redesign so  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:44):**  that there truly is equity and access for all people.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:49):**  As a young farmer, the only historical information I had about sustainable agriculture was centering  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:56):**  white folks and particularly men.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:58):**  So I knew about Eliot Coleman and John Jeavons and the Nearing's, but I had no idea about  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:03):**  the contributions of Cleopatra or Fannie Lou Hamer, Booker T. Watley or George Washington  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:08):**  Carver.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:09):**  So it was so essential for me as part of reclaiming our belonging in the story to do the anthropological  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:16):**  research about our contributions.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:19):**  So for example, Dr. George Washington Carver of Tuskegee Institute was one of the founders  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:27):**  of regenerative agriculture, which is also known as organic agriculture.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:31):**  He taught his students that they should use the peanuts and other leguminous crops in  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:38):**  a rotation with more extractive crops as a way of restoring nitrogen to the soil.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:43):**  He also taught diversified horticulture, composting, mulching, the use of wild crafting and wild  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:53):**  foraging for livestock.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:55):**  And so he was just well beyond his time in terms of restoring and honoring indigenous  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:01):**  ways of farming in a commercial agricultural context.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:06):**  George Washington Carver's contribution to the sustainable agriculture movement is just  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:11):**  one of many examples that Leah refers to as uplift stories.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:17):**  Farming While Black is the story of a whole community being called into action.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:23):**  Leah talks about building a movement and being an effective leader.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:27):**  And she creates a picture of a global network of farmers working to increase farmland stewardship  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:33):**  by people of colour.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:35):**  A vital part of this is Soul Fire Farm's education program, the Black Latinx Farmers Immersion  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:41):**  Program.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:42):**  So the idea with BLFI, which we call it for short, is that about 20 folks from all across  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:49):**  the United States and sometimes from other countries come to live and learn together  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:54):**  on the farm for about a week.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:56):**  It's a 50 hour training program.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:58):**  And in that time, not only do we learn all these concrete farming skills, like how do  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:03):**  you measure cation exchange capacity and what's it good for in the soil through chicken processing  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:09):**  and greenhouse management, marketing, business planning.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:12):**  So it's a really intensive farm training program.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:16):**  And at the same time, it's a container for healing from the trauma of centuries of land  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:21):**  based oppression.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:23):**  So we use a lot of African traditional healing modalities like song and dance, herbal baths,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:30):**  storytelling and deep listening in order to uproot that trauma that's taken hold that  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:35):**  makes us sometimes believe that we don't belong in a life on land.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:39):**  So we're really building community, we're building our spirit and we're also building  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:42):**  our skills.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:43):**  And once folks graduate from BLFI, they become part of our family or sometimes we call ourselves  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:48):**  our farmily forever and ever.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:51):**  And so there's ongoing mentorship, opportunities to connect to resources, grants, loans, as  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:58):**  well as a speakers collective where folks can be part of spreading the message around  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:03):**  black agrarianism.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:04):**  So it's been very exciting.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:06):**  We've had over 500 people go through the program.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:08):**  Almost everyone is continuing to grow food for their community after graduating from  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:13):**  BLFI.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:15):**  And it has a waiting list of hundreds of people every year.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:19):**  And that's been so important to me because one of the myths that I was told about black  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:23):**  farmers is that we're not interested.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:27):**  We left the red clays of Georgia, moved to the urban streets of the north for a better  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:31):**  life and never looked back.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:34):**  And black folks just aren't interested in being on the land.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:37):**  But this anecdotal evidence really flies in the face of that myth.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:40):**  The fact that so many people are lining up over the years to take this program tells  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:45):**  me that we really are in the returning generation of black agrarianism.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:50):**  Yabisi Asili is one of the participants in the youth program.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:54):**  It was just so beautiful and really, really healing and being around so many people of  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:59):**  color my age.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:00):**  There was this big fire and we were singing like songs and whatnot and playing African  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:05):**  drums.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:07):**  And we all had, we all have these blankets.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:08):**  I remember snuggling with my god siblings and just looking out the stars.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:12):**  It was in a big, big field and seeing shooting stars go by and just feeling really, really  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:17):**  appreciated and really present.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:19):**  We would go out and they'd show us different techniques of when farming.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:22):**  We'd plant seeds and whatnot and we'd harvest vegetables.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:26):**  And then we would go and we'd have to cook lunch and we'd use the produce that we had  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:30):**  picked and made lunch from that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:33):**  And learned about traditional African foods or Latinx foods.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:37):**  I used to live in the food desert myself.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:39):**  I used to live in downtown Albany, which is a more poor community.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:44):**  It's probably made up of people of color.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:47):**  After going to this camp, I realized that farming is more about connecting with your  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:50):**  heritage, your ancestry, and these sacred traditions.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:53):**  It's more than just harvesting vegetables so you can eat them.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:58):**  It's a very, very sacred practice that our ancestors have been doing for many generations.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:02):**  Some of my peers who, it depends, it's actually very much race oriented, I feel.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:06):**  Some of my white peers would say that it's just like farming and they're not really  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:10):**  interested.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:11):**  I feel like it's hard to tell them about the rites of passage and whatnot and the more  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:14):**  ancestral part of the farming experience.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:16):**  But some of my friends who are of color and are either Latinx or African, which I am both,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:25):**  they are really, I feel like they're more receptive, they're more interested in this  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:28):**  experience of farming and whatnot and they want to know more about it and they want to  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:33):**  know more about their traditions.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:36):**  I think they're way more curious about it and they're more intrigued in a lot of ways,  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:41):**  which I find interesting.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:43):**  Learning more about farming and that your tradition is something that as a young age  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:47):**  and as you become a youth is very important in your academic career and discovering your  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:52):**  identity in general.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:55):**  And they'd say, just learn more about your heritage and learn more about being with the  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:00):**  land and just try farming, whether or not you like it.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:04):**  I think it's important to try farming and even if you don't like farming, being out  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:07):**  in nature, it gives you the sense of connection.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:10):**  That's very important.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:11):**  I want to be free, so free, like a flower and a bee, like a bird up in a tree, like  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:22):**  a dolphin in the sea.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:24):**  I want to fly high, so high, like an eagle in the sky.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:32):**  And when I come back home, I want to spread my wings and fly.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:37):**  Bacha mama, I'm coming home to the place where I belong.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:49):**  Bacha mama, I'm coming home to the place where I belong.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:00):**  So this was a few years back.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:01):**  We had a group of teens out to the farm and as is typical, many of them did not want to  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:08):**  get out of the van because they were afraid of the bugs and the sunshine and the dirt  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:15):**  and all the unfamiliarity and all the scary stories told about rural spaces.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:19):**  So the fear was legitimate.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:21):**  Dijor was one of these young people and when we did eventually coax Dijor out of the van,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:27):**  he had his hood up and his earbuds in and he did not want to engage with our cheesy  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:31):**  opening circle where we had everyone select an element in nature that represented them  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:36):**  and share out.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:37):**  He just wasn't having any part of that.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:39):**  And when we went on the tour, Dijor was so afraid of getting his sneakers dirty that  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:44):**  he acquiesced and decided to come along and take off his shoes in order to preserve the  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:51):**  sneakers, preserve the beautiful whites of his new kicks.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:55):**  And he came with us and had this most powerful experience while following along.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:04):**  He said when we finished up the tour that his grandmother visited him through the soles  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:10):**  of his bare feet when they were in contact with the earth, that she entered through his  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:15):**  feet up into his heart and reminded him of a time when she was still alive, when he was  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:22):**  young and they garden together and she would place worms and insects and elements of nature  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:27):**  into his bare hands.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:30):**  And at that time he wasn't afraid.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:33):**  So he remembered a time of not being afraid of nature, of really belonging in a time of  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:37):**  being connected to his mother and to the earth.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:40):**  So he shed some tears in our closing circle sharing this and that gave permission for  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:45):**  the other young people to be in their vulnerability and also share memories of their grandparents  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:51):**  and relatives and times of feeling connected.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:54):**  And these youth were actually part of a youth filming program and ended up creating a documentary  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:58):**  in honor of their grandmothers which was one of the most touching and beautiful experiences  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:03):**  that I had mentoring young people at the farm.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:08):**  So at that time we were molds and sebagaihke, but that we were really part of that and  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:21):**  thatmetal.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:22):**  We wanted to let people know that our park real opportunity to take part in the carnival  
**[0:22:33-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:33):**  Ibolele, Ibolele, oh, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolele,  
**[0:22:51-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:51):**  Ibolele, Ibolele, oh, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:13):**  Traditions and rituals are core to Leah's way of farming. For her, spirituality is an  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:19):**  integral part of everyday activities on the farm, and that includes singing. Most of the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:25):**  songs you've heard in this episode were sung at Soul Fire Farm by Leah and her friends.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:30):**  So yeah, there were some elders of mine in Ghana who were incredulous to know that many  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:37):**  farmers in the United States do not integrate any type of rituals or reverence or song or  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:43):**  dance into the cycle of their year. They just couldn't imagine how crops would spring forth  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:50):**  from the earth with such disrespect. And so that's the framework that I'm coming with.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:55):**  And I'm certainly a learner. There's times when I forget and revert to this colonized  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:00):**  perspective of just output, output, output. But we do have festivals that bookend the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:07):**  year. So in the fall, the harvest festival for Haitian people is called Mangeyam, the  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:13):**  eating of the new yams. For us, it's sweet potatoes because yams don't grow in our climate.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:19):**  There's so many things I love about this festival, and a number of family and friends do come  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:24):**  over and enjoy the harvest with us. But the centerpiece of the ritual is this metaphorical  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:31):**  journey back to Guinea. Guinea is Africa, is the land of the ancestors and the source  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:38):**  of good character. So we put banana leaves out all over the floor and roll from west  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:45):**  to east on the banana leaves with east representing Guinea, which is across the Atlantic Ocean  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:51):**  to the east from us. And when we arrive at this location, which is in our living room,  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:58):**  but metaphorically in the land of our ancestors, we receive spiritual instructions and spiritual  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:03):**  renewal and then we roll back across the banana leaves back west to home. And this is deeply  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:09):**  meaningful. It's also super fun. If you can imagine a whole bunch of five to nine year  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:14):**  olds rolling all over banana leaves and getting tangled up in them and bumping into each other,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:19):**  it's really delightful. And then after that ritual, we get to enjoy the feast and we eat  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:26):**  yams and we also eat fish to represent the harvest of the sea as well as the harvest  
**[0:25:31-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:31):**  of the land. There is no culture devoid of planting and harvest rituals. And I think  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:42):**  one of the myths of white supremacy is to erase the indigenous cultural heritage of  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:48):**  all of us. So even folks from the UK, folks from Europe, folks with white skin, if you  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:54):**  reach back, you know, pre-Roman, pre-Greco Empire, you will see that there's indigenous  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:01):**  ways of being that are very connected to the earth. And it might take talking to our great  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:06):**  grandparents that might take reading some books. But I think it's really important for  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:10):**  us to be rooted in our own cultural traditions. It can be so easy to just borrow from others.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:17):**  You know, the Manja Yom Festival was not passed down to me when my grandparents came from  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:21):**  Haiti to the United States. They were really keen on assimilating and so didn't teach  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:27):**  their children French or Creole, didn't even cook a lot of the traditional foods. So it  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:32):**  took my sister and I, you know, going back to Haiti and learning from elders about what  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:38):**  those traditions were that we had lost and then reviving them. And that's something I  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:42):**  really encourage all of us to do. I think it also makes a lot of sense for us to find  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:47):**  rituals that come from our own hearts and minds. And so it can be really simple. It  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:52):**  can just be singing a song of thanks or, you know, taking the time to touch the earth in  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:59):**  a reverent way before putting seed. It doesn't have to be elaborate and complicated. It's  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:04):**  about that pause that really recognizes the sanctity and sovereignty of the moment of  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:10):**  planting and the moment of harvest. Farming can be repetitive, you know, harvesting all  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:15):**  day, weeding all day. And so singing brings joy and connection. I think it reminds us  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:21):**  that the work we're doing isn't just material and helps us transcend into a place of heart  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:26):**  and spirit. And a lot of the songs that we sing intersect with what we're talking about  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:31):**  before around spirituality and praise. These are songs of thanks for our breath and for  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:37):**  the majesty of the soil and the fecundity of the water. So in singing, I think we connect  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:45):**  ourselves to the deeper meaning of the work that we're doing.  
**[0:27:48-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:48):**  The ocean is the beginning of the world. The ocean is the beginning of the world. All life  
**[0:28:00-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:00):**  comes from the sea. All life comes from the sea.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:10):**  I think I would be remiss not to mention Black indigenous solidarity in this narrative. And  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:17):**  one story really illustrates that for me. The crop that is arguably most sacred to the  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:23):**  Haitian people, to my ancestors, is the Jumu pumpkin. And that's because this pumpkin is  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:28):**  so delicious and the white French enslavers would not allow us to taste it during the  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:34):**  period of enslavement. So after our successful revolution in 1804, the celebration was to  
**[0:28:41-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:41):**  make the soup Jumu, this amazing, delicious soup that represents both freedom and also  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:50):**  the justice and liberation. But this pumpkin was gifted to us by the Taino people, by indigenous  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:56):**  people. And in exchange, Black people gave the Taino folks one of our special beans,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:03):**  which is the black-eyed pea. And that alliance has woven itself throughout history. We've  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:10):**  had our ups and downs in terms of really being in solidarity with each other because it is  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:15):**  a colonial project to divide Black and indigenous people from each other. But right now we're  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:20):**  in a period, a really hopeful period of, again, building solidarity and alliances. And so  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:25):**  we're working with a number of indigenous communities across the Northeast of the United  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:29):**  States to form a land trust together. And that land trust would receive reparations  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:35):**  gifts and make them available to Black indigenous growers and earth stewards as a way of regaining  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:44):**  some of the land that was stolen from us during the centuries of settler colonialism.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:50):**  This has been just a small taster of Farming While Black. Before we said goodbye, we asked  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:56):**  Leah if there was anything she wanted to add. My message to all of us who tend the land  
**[0:30:02-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:02):**  is not to get discouraged by the corporate attempts to take over our food system. Smallholders  
**[0:30:10-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:10):**  still produce 70% of the world's food. We are the past and we also are the future of  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:19):**  feeding the entire planet in a way that doesn't destroy our ecological base. So just keep  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:24):**  at it. We're part of the long view of history and we're already winning even on days when  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:31):**  we can't feel it. Farming While Black is a powerful reminder  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:36):**  that farming is inherently and inevitably political and spiritual. It's a book that  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:44):**  compels you to acknowledge the contribution of people of colour to regenerative agriculture  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:49):**  over many centuries and it forces you to reconsider the act of farming and the role of farmers  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:56):**  in society. It's a story of one Black woman embracing the land and activating a whole  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:02):**  community to do the same. Leah tells the wisdom of her ancestors, fills you with practical  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:09):**  tips for beginner farmers, encourages you to sing and dance and celebrate your roots,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:15):**  to work together to heal hundreds of years of trauma and she paves the way for people  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:20):**  of colour to reclaim their rightful place of dignified agency in the food system. The  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:26):**  book is at once fiercely political, deeply practical and unashamedly spiritual because  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:32):**  as Leah shows us, farming is all of those things.

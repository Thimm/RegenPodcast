**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:01:51):**  grazing. So we all know, well not we all don't know, but there's a growing number of people  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:01:57):**  that understand how to use mob grazing and regenerative grazing and that can work pretty  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:02):**  well and these things should never be a formula but you know we know how to do that reasonably  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:07):**  well in the lowland areas or areas where you can paddock down into small areas. But you  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:14):**  know when you've got a huge fell, you've got sort of five or six flocks potentially sharing  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:18):**  a large mountain with no fences in between because they're all hefted and nobody can  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:23):**  agree on anything and if you reduce your numbers everybody else has fell in your space. You  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:30):**  know these are really difficult cultural contexts and that makes life a lot more confusing.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:37):**  So we've really wanted to work on how could we make this work and nearly all of these  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:40):**  projects, whether they're farming projects or driven by ecological restoration like rewilding,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:47):**  all fall down on the back of the social piece not being fully addressed. So people don't  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:51):**  understand how important it is. They think they can just come up with a set of prescriptions  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:02:55):**  for land management and as long as the farmers or the managers will follow those that they'll  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:01):**  work and of course it just doesn't work and that's what holistic management is all about  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:05):**  is the understanding that there's more to it, that we need to address the social issues  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:09):**  and that might be the fact that farmers want to be farmers, they don't necessarily want  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:13):**  to be paid to just look after wildlife, although it's becoming a very important part of it.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:19):**  You know in rewilding projects similarly you're working in places where we've got a rich cultural  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:24):**  heritage of upland management, whether that's management for deer, grouse or sheep and it's  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:30):**  got to be addressed and incorporated or at least understood better I think. And we hope  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:34):**  that with wilder culture that's what we can achieve. We can come up with bespoke models  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:38):**  for different situations, whether that's a grouse moor or a sheep farm, but really we're  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:43):**  looking at how do we manage large blocks of land in ways that suit the people that are  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:49):**  actually running it and it's economically viable because again lots of conservation  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:54):**  organisations doing great stuff but if it doesn't pay the bills on its own right it's  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:03:58):**  never going to take off throughout all of the landowners that are privately owned, it's  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:02):**  only ever going to be limited to where conservation organisations can fund it. So we're really  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:07):**  keen on developing practical, effective, large scale applications of this so that people  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:14):**  will just think this makes sense, it's better for us in lots of different ways, it's better  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:17):**  because we're enjoying our management, it's better for the livestock, it's more profitable  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:22):**  and of course at the same time it's extremely effective at restoring the ecology as well.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:28):**  And what that looks like in many of our projects so far is a kind of splitting the farm into  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:32):**  productive area and a sort of hill area if you like that's less productive and running  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:37):**  it like two blocks, management blocks. So we have, generally speaking on the three projects  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:41):**  we've got, we've got what we're calling the winter block which is the hilly area that's  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:45):**  less productive, it's rested all summer so all the trees can grow there, we want to just  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:50):**  allow it to succeed to a wood pasture type environment so everything can grow unhindered  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:04:55):**  from grazing and then during that period we'll use the in-by and paddock that and sort of  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:00):**  do regenerative grazing management through those in-by areas more like your conventional  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:05):**  sort of mob grazing and then reverse it so that it that gets a rest all winter that means  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:10):**  that you're getting a nice warm thatch put down on the soil surface so that stuff grows  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:14):**  a bit earlier in the spring and everything's, the soil is protected and all the microbes  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:19):**  can do their stuff through the winter and then as I said they got, they have deferred  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:23):**  grazing that's had a full summer's rest so that they can pretty much we can get away  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:27):**  from using any tractors having to make hay, you know it's a transition so this takes a  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:32):**  bit of time but eventually that's the aim is to get to the point where we can pretty  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:35):**  much be you know not needing any fossil fuel use at all or is very minimal and that would  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:42):**  be sequestering carbon so in theory you know we should be putting more down than we're  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:46):**  putting out and at the same time we're really hoping that we can optimise biodiversity and  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:50):**  that all the early indications show that that's definitely the case.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:54):**  Rewilding is brilliant with this we've had such wonderful results from such great projects  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:05:58):**  with rewilding you know NEPS just led the way and I'm certainly not thinking that wilderculture  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:04):**  is an alternative you know we want both and similarly want conventional farming too or  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:08):**  certainly a more regenerative version so this is just another option within the suite of  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:12):**  land management options I think.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:14):**  If we rewilded all of the uplands that seems like a great idea and people will sort of  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:19):**  use this very simplistic calculations about what food can be produced and the fact that  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:23):**  that's less productive so you know we just we should just concentrate on producing more  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:27):**  intensively on other areas but I think what we've learned with regenerative is that actually  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:33):**  it doesn't need necessarily need to be less and actually what's really important is the  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:37):**  nutrient density of the food that's been produced so plant-based foods that can be produced  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:41):**  very intensively certainly in a conventional system are very low in nutrients and also  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:45):**  I think that again if we're taking a holistic approach to management we've got to realise  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:48):**  that the cultural and the social aspects of what we do in our countryside is really important  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:52):**  and you know we don't want to lose our hay meadows we don't want to lose our fell farmers  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:57):**  or we don't want to lose the herded sheep in the Lake District you know there's lots  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:06:59):**  of really good reasons that are that we need to keep those things you know if we decide

**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:13):**  and that hefting system so this is these are big decisions that should be given you know  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:18):**  serious consideration so what we feel is and I'm not sure there is a real solution to the

**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:33):**  so our job is to sort of teach the principles and test certain elements of the principles  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:38):**  and then try and find some pilot projects to demonstrate it to the best of our ability  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:42):**  but really it's up to these individual farmers to get on board and that's why again we unlike  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:47):**  a lot of the conservation organisations which are buying up land so they can manage it in  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:07:50):**  hand which is obviously the easiest approach if you can find the money because you've got

**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:08:00):**  if we do training and we work with sort of partnerships and management agreements so  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:08:05):**  we we're working on going into agreements you know estates and landowners where we help  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:08:12):**  the transition we sort of do consultancy arrangement or we can do some sort of long-term management

**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:08:26):**  and use our time and energy in the best way possible to get the maximum impact of the

**[0:10:44-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:10:44):**  able to work with over 5,000 farmers in Kenya in this TREEDM project and we have distributed

**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:11:03):**  has really helped us and helped our farmers in Kenya to uplift their living standards.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:11:11):**  Last week we had a group of farmers who were celebrating because of the work that we did

**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:11:25):**  bananas that we gave them. One of the medicinal trees that we are promoting is Prunus africana.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:11:31):**  It's called the African cherry and we are also promoting Moringa olivera as a medicinal

**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:11:54):**  are known to be medicinal since long time in Memoria. With the technologies I think  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:00):**  as a director indica which is NIM, they are companies that are manufacturing some medicines  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:08):**  and exporting them but for us we are doing it at the local level. Farmers are using it  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:13):**  locally. We are distributing them for free is one thing that is making farmers to really  
**[0:12:20-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:20):**  like the project and then the selection of the trees to use is also very strategic because  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:29):**  we are not just planting trees. We are planting trees that will have good benefits to the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:35):**  farmers that will bring benefits to the farmers almost immediately. This is through improving  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:42):**  the kind of trees that we are giving them. For avocados we are doing a lot of propagation,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:51):**  a lot of grafting so that we give them the improved varieties. That one is also giving  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:12:58):**  us a plus. Plus of course the training that we are giving them and the monitoring system  
**[0:13:06-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:06):**  by TreeDom is also good because they have a system where we take photographs and that  
**[0:13:15-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:15):**  factor that the farmer feels secure when his tree is registered and they are very happy.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:23):**  Before we give them trees we train them on best agricultural practices not just for tree  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:30):**  management but for the farm management. Then we go down to agroforestry which is tree planting  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:37):**  and we go specifically to the trees that we are distributing to the farmers and we train  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:45):**  them how to manage those trees, their requirements, how to do even pest management, how to do  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:52):**  harvesting and all that including marketing because marketing is also an issue. It's a  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:13:58):**  whole range of training from production to marketing. So farmers go through all that  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:06):**  orientation before and after they receive the trees. Lastly, those people who buy those  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:14):**  photographs, some of them visitors, like this year we received a few visitors at the beginning  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:21):**  of the year before COVID-19 came. It's a very interesting program. I would say that it is  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:27):**  quite different from the others. The conventional way of training farmers is just plant trees  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:33):**  and then they plant no follow-ups, nothing. It is really working for us. We go back with  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:39):**  other programs like composting, the issue of seed selection, all those. So we do a lot  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:47):**  of integration, a lot of integrating other projects into the TREADOM program. I have  
**[0:14:54-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:14:54):**  always liked agriculture, that is personal. The other thing is that I'm a professor myself.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:04):**  I am an entomologist and I have always liked working with the communities. I left teaching.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:13):**  I left because I felt that I was not giving enough to the communities. It's my passion

**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:28):**  of farming. For the last almost, it's now going to that  
**[0:15:35-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:35):**  I have been promoting organic agriculture, sustainable agriculture. I have a lot of extensive  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:43):**  know-how on sustainable agriculture systems. As an entomologist, I have been working with  
**[0:15:50-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:50):**  the university. I have been working with the conventional systems. But I always look at  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:15:58):**  the other side of the coin. I thought that I would be one of those people who would help  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:16:04):**  our farmers to have a balance between the conventional agriculture and their way of  
**[0:16:10-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:16:10):**  living. Therefore, I felt that if I concentrated a lot of my research on especially methods  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:16:22):**  that are going to remove the farmers' problems without a lot of use of chemicals, I thought

**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:26:09):**  first one is waste. We have this idea and along with that we have some other concepts  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:26:15):**  like with waste we also have consumption, we also have pollution. The idea is that something  
**[0:26:23-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:26:23):**  has value and then that thing, whatever it is, that value is used. In the use of that  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:26:33):**  value, the value is destroyed. Then we have this thing that is waste and waste is something

**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:29:43):**  The degenerative term was natural or also unnatural. The regenerative term was healthy  
**[0:29:51-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:29:51):**  and to feel whole. Yeah. This is the one that for me was the most difficult and actually  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:30:02):**  was part of the trigger of the breakdown that I experienced. I think this is something that

**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:30:47):**  does, copy nature's systems. We're disconnected from nature. What this definition tells you

**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:31:26):**  which is really the underlying message in all of this, which is very dark, is that the best thing  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:31:33):**  you can do is to kill yourself. The bottom of the message is that you have no function here. You  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:31:40):**  have no beneficial purpose. Given that the world is in this state of crisis and climate change is

**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration#t=0:32:13):**  meet long-time environmentalists. A lot of them are depressed. A lot of us are depressed, and we

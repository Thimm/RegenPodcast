## 64: Dung beetles, herbal medicine, hydrology and soil carbon  
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:06):**  This month we learn from an entomologist in Wiltshire about the importance of dung beetles  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:12):**  in our farming systems.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:14):**  We hear how a medical herbalist in London is bringing people together to care for and  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:19):**  heal each other.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:21):**  And a soil microbiologist shares how restoring hydrological cycles is vital in mitigating  
**[0:00:27-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:27):**  the climate crisis.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:35):**  Sally-Anne Spence is a farmer and entomologist who's helped launch Dung Beetles for Farmers,  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:41):**  a website with practical tips for how farmers can help this keystone species thrive on their  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:46):**  farms.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:49):**  So dung beetles are a whole group of insects that are based around breaking down dung.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:54):**  They live, they inhabit the dungpacks themselves.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:00:57):**  And the reason we don't see them so much in the UK and why we're not so aware of them  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:01):**  is because they are actually living in the dung or under the dung.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:04):**  So we have two groups in the UK, those that live in it, the dwellers, and those that live  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:08):**  underneath it in long tunnels underneath the dung.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:11):**  We don't have the rollers, the big David Attenborough nature programme where it's got a lump of  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:15):**  elephant poo and it's rolling it across the road and the jeep stops and everybody leaps  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:19):**  out and takes loads of photographs.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:21):**  We don't have those in this country and because we don't have those, we don't see them, we  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:25):**  just forget about our dung beetles.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:27):**  But they are there.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:28):**  Dung beetles are phenomenally important in pasture land.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:32):**  And the biggest reason of all is that they actually remove the dung.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:35):**  If you have that dung staying on the pasture, it'll actually damage the pasture land, it'll  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:39):**  reduce the grazing opportunities for the livestock and it will actually increase pests within  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:44):**  the livestock as well.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:45):**  So removing the dung is the first and foremost thing that the dung beetles do that's really,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:50):**  really important to everybody that's concerned with that pasture land.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:54):**  Now they also, in removing the dung, they're releasing the nutrients that are inside that  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:01:58):**  dung back into the pasture so that the roots and the plants can take it back up and the  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:02):**  grass can grow better.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:04):**  And so they're really, really important for that.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:06):**  And then you've got the fact that they're digging these tunnels underneath, the tunnellers,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:10):**  you've got soil aeration, you've got water infiltration.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:13):**  You know, these are all good things for soil health.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:16):**  They're actually taking the organic matter down and releasing the organic matter nutrients  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:20):**  into the soil for all the things that are actually living within the soil as well.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:25):**  If they're breaking up the dung, there's various parasites that actually pass through the animal  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:30):**  and can be re-ingested.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:31):**  So you can have a worm infestation in an animal that will actually pass through the gut of  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:38):**  the animal and out into the dung, still live, still in the larval form.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:43):**  It'll then change into a next stage in the larval form and it'll migrate into the grass  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:47):**  growing around the dung, climb up the grass and get eaten by the animal again and go back  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:52):**  through its stages.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:53):**  And if you've got the dung being broken up and got rid of, that reduces the habitat for  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:02:57):**  that parasite larvae to actually go through its whole cycle.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:00):**  It breaks it up and so it stops the animal getting the parasites.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:04):**  They are also really important food.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:07):**  Now lots of people talk about dung beetles are food for bats.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:09):**  Yes, they are.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:10):**  They're very, very important to bats and bats are a species that's in decline generally.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:15):**  And they're also very important for birds and badgers, foxes, all sorts of things eat  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:20):**  them.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:21):**  Owls will eat a dung beetle, a nice big geotropin walking through the grass at night and owl  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:24):**  will quite happily have that.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:26):**  You've got all sorts of things that will feed on it from raptors to waders to songbirds,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:30):**  all sorts of different things.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:31):**  And here we have swallows and swifts that come every year and they will spend a lot  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:36):**  of the time, especially the swallows, over the pasture land.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:39):**  And some of the things they're collecting are flies, but they're also collecting and  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:42):**  feeding dung beetles to their larvae too.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:44):**  So they're very, very important to the whole ecosystem, the biodiversity, the soil health,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:49):**  and actually for the animal's health in the farm.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:51):**  So that you're getting three real big major things ticked off because of dung beetles.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:56):**  So really, really important, tiny, but an awful lot of them.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:03:59):**  And that's what the important part is.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:01):**  So there's been a decline in dung beetles and we've been seeing this because we've been  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:06):**  mapping their populations, finding out where they are and using historic specimens and  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:10):**  the data in museums.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:12):**  So we've been able to build up a data line of what dung beetles were where at one stage.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:17):**  And then we've been able to look forward and actually go out and survey and see how dung  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:22):**  beetles are doing today.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:23):**  And there has been a marked decline.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:26):**  And that decline has come through many reasons.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:28):**  One is the removal of livestock.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:30):**  So I live on the Wilkshire Downs and up here was big sheep wool country, lots and lots  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:34):**  of sheep all over the Downs.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:36):**  Those sheep have now gone and there's only a few grazing flocks and the grassland has  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:41):**  been turned into arable.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:42):**  So you've lost that habitat.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:43):**  If there's no dung, there is no dung beetles.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:46):**  They can't survive without the dung.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:48):**  Change of use, areas where there was livestock, the livestock has gone and it's now either  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:52):**  a car park or a golf course or arable, that sort of thing.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:55):**  That is a habitat removal and habitat loss.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:04:59):**  And then you've got habitat disturbance.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:02):**  So if you've got animals in a field one year and then you come in and you chain harrow  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:07):**  it, you are disturbing that soil.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:09):**  And in the soil underneath the dung is where all the pupae are, all the middle stage of  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:14):**  the life cycle of the dung beetle.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:16):**  Before they actually develop into a natural beetle, you'll be disturbing them and exposing  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:20):**  them to predators and everything else if you go through that soil.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:23):**  So soil damage in any way, shape or form in that respect.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:26):**  And if you're using an insecticide, you are going to kill insects or invertebrates.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:30):**  And it's obviously designed to kill off the parasites.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:33):**  Animal welfare is incredibly important.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:35):**  However, depending on the range of lethal and sublethal, the chemical you're using,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:40):**  you get a range of lethal and sublethal effects.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:43):**  And that sort of depends on the concentration of the various chemicals.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:47):**  But this will result in death in the dung beetles if it's very strong when they first  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:51):**  come to the dung to eat the dung.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:52):**  Because you've got to remember the dung beetles are consuming the dung.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:54):**  So if there's anything in the dung, they're going to end up eating it.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:05:57):**  So there's a real threat to dung beetles, the loss of habitat, the disturbance of habitat  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:03):**  and the use of insecticides.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:05):**  As a community of people, we all understand the importance of earthworms now.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:10):**  Everybody really gets earthworms.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:11):**  Earthworms are phenomenally important to our soil.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:14):**  And yet they're still quite small, an earthworm.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:17):**  But we now accept that earthworms are really, really important because there's lots of them  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:19):**  and what they're doing is incredible.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:21):**  What we've got to do is the same as dung beetles.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:23):**  Dung beetles are really small, but there's lots of them and what they're doing is incredible.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:27):**  So we just need to get that mindset is just to accept that although the insects are small,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:32):**  it's the sheer mass of them and they really are moving it.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:35):**  A lot of people will go out into their paddocks and think, well, basically, perhaps they don't  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:40):**  think about the dung.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:41):**  Perhaps they haven't realized the dung has disappeared.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:42):**  They just accept the dung has disappeared.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:45):**  The report to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the IUCN report, puts  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:50):**  them nearly, well, virtually half of them, just over half of the dung beetle species  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:06:55):**  are considered locally or regionally threatened to extinct.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:07:00):**  So let's not go out one day and suddenly realize that the dung is still there.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:07:04):**  Let's appreciate what's actually moving that dung and doing those ecosystem services.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:07:09):**  And it is the dung beetles.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:07:12):**  Dung Beetles for Farmers.co.uk is a collective effort by farmers, vets and scientists and

**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:02):**  We spoke with Rashika as part of Who Feeds Us, our 2020 series about the people who helped

**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:14):**  So here's a snippet to bring the Who Feeds Us stories back into our lives.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:20):**  And definitely head to our blog to read more of her story as well.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:25):**  Medicine originally was something that was accessible to all humans.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:29):**  It's something we've evolved with.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:31):**  We've cohabited with plants that are much, much older than us and really know how to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:36):**  inhabit the earth.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:38):**  They contain a lot of compounds that support our bodies, but also in their own right, they're  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:43):**  living beings, and we make a kind of an exchange with them that is more than just about the  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:49):**  physical cellular level.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:52):**  Medicine has become about extraction, active ingredients from plants, that kind of reflects  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:08:57):**  the way that humans have taken this extractive approach to the resources of the earth rather  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:02):**  than a more cooperative, exchange based way of living, if that makes sense.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:09):**  And healthcare isn't necessarily about caring and nourishing us, but it's about making money  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:15):**  and profit a lot of the time.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:18):**  I guess it's part of the whole way that for the last few hundred years, humanity has seen  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:23):**  progress being kind of distancing ourselves from our physical bodies and being more about  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:28):**  rationality in the mind.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:29):**  And yeah, maybe it's not a surprising outcome, but in the end, we can't live without what  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:36):**  the earth gives us.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:38):**  And yeah, it's something that has been forgotten, but I think is still very much present in  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:44):**  certain cultures.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:45):**  So like in Ayurvedic medicine and Chinese medicine and pretty much most parts of the  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:50):**  world that I've spoken to people about, there's a strong idea that food is medicinal.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:09:56):**  And people talk about the energies of food, like for example, in a simple way, food being  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:01):**  heating or cooling, or moist or dry, this kind of thing.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:05):**  And that's very much still present in, I know it is in Indian culture.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:09):**  And I remember speaking to someone at a workshop from Iran who was talking about this and the  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:12):**  effect that the different energies of food have on your body.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:16):**  I think the rise of kind of foraging and wild food and herbalism, all of this has really  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:22):**  reawakened that knowledge in humans again.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:25):**  Yeah, we've been separated from it, but it's not unfamiliar really.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:30):**  Having this knowledge and using it as a kind of revolutionary act in this world, I think  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:34):**  it's massively important.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:36):**  On a personal level, it's really helped me living in London, knowing the plants that  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:40):**  grow around me in the wild spaces and also then feeling this desire to nurture it more  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:46):**  and take care of the land that we live in.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:49):**  Originally in the meadow were planted plants that grow wild all around the British Isles  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:55):**  that have a history of use, medicinal use for the last thousand years.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:10:59):**  They're ones that you have weeds really plants that you would find all over the place.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:02):**  So common ones are plants like yarrow, comfrey, which is a great healer of bones and connective  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:10):**  tissue, plantain, rip-warp plantain.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:14):**  I think there's marshmallow has been planted.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:16):**  Ground ivy is really good, another good respiratory system herb.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:20):**  What else?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:21):**  Mugwort I think there is and vervain, which are two herbs that were sacred to the Anglo-Saxons  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:26):**  in the 10th century.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:28):**  We did a harvest of a plant called Ella campaign, which is root that we use for respiratory  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:34):**  infection and to heal the lungs and help with breathing.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:39):**  So also really kind of relevant for this moment.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:42):**  But it worked really well, the activity where we did a harvest of the root and then we collectively  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:48):**  in a workshop made it into a syrup, a cough syrup.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:52):**  And the whole model just seemed to be really exciting was being in the garden, learning  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:11:56):**  about the plants as a group and then communally making medicine together.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:02):**  And this then turned into that we started distributing medicines we made from the garden  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:07):**  and the workshops.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:08):**  And we were doing that, we've been doing that alongside refugee community kitchen who do  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:13):**  hot food distribution.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:16):**  Also at Bethnal Green, so it's all very much within one locality.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:20):**  So we started going out monthly and giving out seasonal medicines like cough remedies  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:25):**  and immune protection alongside our CK.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:30):**  And that's still going on now the mobile apothecary we sort of shifted to doing weekly distribution  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:35):**  as a rapid response when the pandemic started.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:39):**  So offering protective remedies for people living on the street or others that don't  
**[0:12:45-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:45):**  have access to welfare, don't have access to healthcare resources as much as other people.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:53):**  People from different cultures have come along and shared with us the plants that they use  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:12:58):**  in their home life as well.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:00):**  But I think it's been quite a revelatory thing for some people to say, go, all right, yeah,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:05):**  these plants grow around us and we can use them quite easily.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:08):**  So a project that I'm doing closer to home in Wharton Forest is the community apothecary  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:12):**  where we're starting to develop herb gardens, medicinal herb gardens where people come and  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:17):**  learn how to grow herbs themselves.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:19):**  And then we together, we're harvesting the herbs and making them into medicines for people  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:24):**  in the community.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:26):**  And it's already been happening that people are saying, oh, right, like I'm going to start  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:31):**  growing these in my garden at home or we've got quite a big garden, can we start to make  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:34):**  it into a medicine garden?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:36):**  So that's really the beauty of this is, you know, we don't have this thing where some  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:40):**  people have no knowledge and kind of deign to share it with others.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:44):**  It's something that is accessible to everybody and everyone can develop it and use it in  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:48):**  their own way.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:49):**  I just have always this long term vision of a place like the medicine house in India that  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:13:54):**  my dad's grandfather started of being a lovely hub, a social hub where people can come and  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:00):**  hang out with each other and learn about medicines and learn about plants and take part in growing  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:05):**  them together.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:06):**  For me, it's really a community thing.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:09):**  I just feel really happy and connected with the place where I live when we're in these  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:13):**  gardens doing all the stuff together.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:15):**  It just makes you feel strong, joyful.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:19):**  You feel good, you know, in your body and your soul.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:21):**  So for me, I see it being a place, a location where people can come to and connect with  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:27):**  each other and feel taken care of and take care of each other.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:33):**  So, yeah, all of the things that are happening in London that I'm connected with, all the  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:38):**  gardens and the projects makes you feel like part of this big web, this network of people  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:43):**  making each other healthier.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:50):**  Walter Yenna is a soil microbiologist and director of Healthy Soils Australia.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:14:55):**  Walter has talked extensively about the Earth's soil carbon sponge and hydrology as they relate  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:01):**  to the climate crisis.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:03):**  This interview originally appeared on the podcast Investing in Regenerative Agriculture,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:09):**  made by our friend, Khurun Seijin.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:11):**  We're really grateful to Khurun for allowing us to share his interview and definitely recommend  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:18):**  tuning in to the whole thing.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:22):**  If you go back 420 million years, there were no soils, it was just ocean and rock.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:27):**  And it was the fungal processes of pedogenesis, the lichens and the mosses that then dissolve  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:35):**  that rock, leaving organic matter behind, creating soil.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:39):**  And it's a soil then that formed for the first time that succession of plants on land.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:46):**  And of course, that built the soil.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:49):**  And with the soil, we built hydrology, the capacity of those soils to retain water, to  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:55):**  infiltrate, retain rain before it used to just all run off.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:15:58):**  And that actually then created life on land, right?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:02):**  So it's really soil in nature is the point of generation.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:08):**  And so if we need to regenerate, it's just logical that, hey, we've got to go back and  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:13):**  use exactly the same processes that nature did in creating the biosphere we all depend  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:20):**  on.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:21):**  And it's safe to say we haven't been in the last 50 or in some cases 12,000 years.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:26):**  We haven't used those processes of nature.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:29):**  We've done the opposite.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:30):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:31):**  But we shouldn't be too harsh on ourselves.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:34):**  Because what we're saying is, no, we have agency.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:38):**  We have a capacity to either degenerate, degrade or regenerate.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:45):**  So it's a very empowering understanding of soils that, hey, this is our point of agency.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:51):**  It's actually quite profound to that when you think of it, humans, it is the only point  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:16:58):**  of agency we have on the planet.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:00):**  Explain that.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:01):**  And I'd contemplate, well, look, what can I do to the oceans?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:04):**  What can do the air?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:06):**  But you really have to then come back to soils and our management of soils if you want to  
**[0:17:11-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:11):**  influence anything in this biogeological cycle and the dynamics of the planet.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:20):**  So now we've got climate change.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:22):**  We've obviously got a planetary emergency.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:24):**  It's critical.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:25):**  But when you think of our point of leverage, even CO2, we have to go back to soils because  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:32):**  we have to ask the question, one, where did the CO2 come from?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:36):**  Yes, the oxidation largely of soils, as you said, for the last 12,000 years.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:42):**  But also if we have to draw down CO2 from the air, what can we do?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:48):**  Yes, we can draw it down and put it back into the soil as stable soil carbon.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:55):**  So even managing CO2 is a soils issue.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:17:59):**  Because many people are questioning that.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:00):**  They are saying they're questioning the carbon piece, the CO2 piece, because they're saying  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:05):**  it only gets stored in the first 30 centimeters according to the common model.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:09):**  It's not stable because then when we plow and you're saying it's the only point of agency  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:15):**  we have is actually the soil.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:17):**  Well, look, I mean, and the science is very important to mention this, about 750 billion  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:23):**  tons of carbon in the air is CO2.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:27):**  There's currently about 3,000 billion tons of carbon in our soils.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:33):**  But that may be half of what there was 12,000 years ago when you consider how much we've  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:39):**  oxidized, cleared, desertified.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:43):**  So the soils as a major sink might have been eight times more than in the atmosphere.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:51):**  And in a sense, it's really the buffer.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:53):**  And in a sense, we have altered that buffer.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:18:57):**  But it's the only point of agency, the only point we have of actually removing carbon  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:02):**  from the air, from the ocean to put it back into this other sink.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:06):**  Because a lot of the carbon went into the ocean.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:08):**  Yes, yes.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:09):**  Well, actually, it's very serious because it says why soils are so important, because  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:16):**  absolutely when we release carbon dioxide, initially about half goes into the ocean.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:23):**  But then it re-equilibrates and it ends up with about a third of the CO2 we've released  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:28):**  is in the oceans.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:30):**  There's some 38,000 billion tons of carbon dissolved in the ocean.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:36):**  And it makes a point, you see, that's 50 times the carbon in the atmosphere.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:42):**  And so even if we try to draw down carbon in the atmosphere, the oceans will, as a big  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:48):**  buffered system, will just re-equilibrate.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:51):**  So it will take centuries for us even drawing down, even having negative net emissions to  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:19:57):**  change the carbon in the atmosphere in a meaningful way to change its greenhouse effect.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:05):**  So it's actually the evidence that we can't fix the climate anymore with CO2 emissions  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:12):**  reductions because the ocean is such an enormous sink.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:16):**  And it will release it again as we are drawing it down from the air.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:20):**  And so we now have to say, where is there a bigger point of agency?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:25):**  And that's where we come to soils.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:27):**  So just to summarize that point, we have released so much carbon and a lot of that ended up  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:33):**  in the oceans.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:34):**  And if we're now going to draw down, which we want to, and we're going to get to that  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:37):**  in soils, but for another reason, you're going to draw down a lot of this carbon, it will  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:41):**  basically be released from the oceans.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:44):**  And so the amount of carbon in the atmosphere won't really go down and will take centuries  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:47):**  before that amount goes under 400 parts per million or 350 or whatever we're talking.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:54):**  So why are you not super depressed?  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:55):**  Because that sounds very depressing.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:20:57):**  OK, no, no, look, we gave up on worrying about carbon emissions as a tool for reducing the  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:04):**  reducing climate, the CO2 atmosphere concentration.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:09):**  It can't affect the climate.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:11):**  But if we put carbon into the soil, then we have another force multiplier, because if  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:18):**  we put carbon in the soil, we can hold more water.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:22):**  Now we get to the interesting part.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:24):**  And if we can hold more water, then we engage the next more dominant whole fundamental of  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:31):**  the climate, and that is that 95 percent of the heat dynamics of the blue planet is driven  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:38):**  by water.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:39):**  The CO2 component in the air drives 4 percent.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:43):**  So now instead of being trying to manage the climate with 4 percent, we have 95 percent  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:51):**  leverage effect if we manage the hydrology.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:54):**  But we can only do that if we have water in our soils.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:21:59):**  And so the carbon in the soil is critical to get the water in the soil.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:04):**  So that's why the soil carbon sponge is such an essential concept.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:09):**  It's not the fact of drawing down carbon.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:12):**  It's about rebuilding the soil carbon sponge, hydrology, and then our power to cool the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:20):**  planet safely and naturally in time through that hydrological process.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:26):**  So you're saying we have been pulling on the wrong lever, basically.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:30):**  We've been pulling on the 4 percent lever while we could be pulling or working on the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:35):**  95 percent lever.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:38):**  Why are we all so excited about the CO2?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:41):**  Let's just take it a little bit further.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:43):**  See, I think we've been focused on the symptom.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:46):**  OK, we looked at Charles Keeling's beautiful graph from 1958 when he said here was CO2  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:53):**  going up, the zig-zag going up every year.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:22:58):**  And we've looked at the symptom of our land degradation, our fossil fuel use, and said  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:03):**  the symptom is the problem.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:06):**  And cleaning up the symptom is a solution.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:10):**  But it's not like that.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:11):**  You see, it's just the symptom.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:12):**  It's a resource.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:13):**  It's like fever.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:15):**  If we can take that resource and put it back into the soil, then we can engage hydrology.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:22):**  And hydrology is the driver of the heat dynamics.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:26):**  And hydrology is our potential to safely and naturally cool the planet almost immediately,  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:34):**  not the centuries that we can no longer wait for CO2 to have an effect.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:40):**  We can use a 95 percent lever, as you said, not the 4 percent lever.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:45):**  And so it's the CO2.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:48):**  We have heard this before.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:49):**  Actually, I will link the interview below with Zach Wise, where he called climate change  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:53):**  and carbon the symptom of a much bigger of land degradation and broken water cycles.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:23:58):**  And that's exactly why I wanted to have you on it as well, because I've heard you speak  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:02):**  on it and read a number of things.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:04):**  We need to focus on water.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:05):**  And it happens to be the same thing at the end in soil.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:08):**  Like that's if we regenerate and restore soils, we store a lot more water because of the carbon  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:12):**  and not because we want to store the carbon, but we actually want to restore the water  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:15):**  cycle.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:17):**  So it's the resource that we need to use to rebuild the soils, to rebuild the water, to  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:22):**  cool the planet.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:25):**  And so just to reiterate the water cycle for people that are not spending a lot of time  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:30):**  on that, what are the key pieces there?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:33):**  If you had to explain it to a six year old, what are the key pieces of the water cycle  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:37):**  that we should all know?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:38):**  OK, well, look, I mean, obviously, first of all, you look at water.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:42):**  Seventy one percent of the planet is covered with oceans, 4000 meters deep, right?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:48):**  Four kilometers deep on average.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:50):**  So there's a lot of water on this planet and it's got this extraordinary capacity to absorb  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:56):**  and retain heat.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:24:58):**  And so that's why it's a key part of the heat dynamics.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:03):**  And even with climate change, 93 percent of the additional heat that we're warming the  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:08):**  planet with is going into the oceans.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:11):**  So what we're recording at the moment is only a fraction of what the system is taking.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:19):**  But then we've got to look at water.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:21):**  So, yeah, that's the heat buffer effect.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:23):**  But now what are the processes that involve with warming and cooling the planet through  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:29):**  these hydrological processes?  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:32):**  And there's about 10 steps, both warming and cooling, where water regulates 95 percent  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:39):**  of the heat dynamics of the planet.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:42):**  But they're very simple.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:43):**  And for example, the key one that we can focus on is just a transpiration.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:49):**  When water is taken from soils by vegetation and taken up into the atmosphere, it has to  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:25:57):**  transfer from liquid to a gas, water vapor.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:01):**  But to do that, it needs to be converted from liquid to gas.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:05):**  And that takes about 590 calories of heat energy per gram of water.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:12):**  So this is an enormous quantity of heat that is taken from the surface by vegetation transpiring  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:20):**  and taken back up into the atmosphere.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:23):**  And of course, that cools the surface.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:26):**  It's like when we're sweating.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:27):**  So if you have a bare piece of land compared to a strongly vegetated piece of land, first  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:33):**  of all, you feel it immediately because underneath it's cool compared to the other.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:37):**  But it actually cools, let's say, the microclimate around that, in that, above it as well, because  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:42):**  it takes so much energy and so much warmth for that plant to transpire that liquid.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:47):**  But it needs the water, obviously, somewhere because the soil needs to be full of water.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:50):**  Otherwise, it cannot happen.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:51):**  And the amount of heat that it does is profound.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:55):**  When you think of it, you think of the Earth as a planet.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:26:59):**  There's solar energy coming in, 342 watts per square meter on average continually.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:06):**  And to have a stable climate, you've got to have 342 watts going out.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:10):**  And of course, we've impeded that heat escape, and that's the greenhouse effect.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:15):**  And we're heating the planet artificially about 3 watts per square meter, which is about  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:21):**  1% unbalanced.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:24):**  But the Earth's transpiration, these latent heat fluxes through transpiration, evaporation,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:31):**  they naturally take 24% of the heat that we're getting from the sun, taking it from the surface  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:38):**  back up into the atmosphere.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:40):**  It's 2085 watts per square meter globally, or 24% of the heat energy this process is  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:48):**  actually using to take it from the surface.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:52):**  And so theoretically, if we just increase the vegetation 4%, we can do that 1% cooling  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:27:59):**  effect, right?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:01):**  So another argument to reforest, regreen.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:04):**  To regenerate, right?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:06):**  Take away asphalt, yeah.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:08):**  So 4% regeneration, in a sense, offsets the abnormal warming of the planet.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:15):**  And of course, when you think of that, we've basically cleared half the vegetation on the  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:19):**  planet already in the last 8,000 years, you know, through deforestation, desertification,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:26):**  agriculture, cities, etc.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:29):**  So we've delimited 50% and we have to regenerate 4%.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:34):**  Sounds doable.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:35):**  Well, how easy is that?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:36):**  That's the interesting part.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:37):**  I mean, how beneficial and how doable and practical.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:42):**  We couldn't resist adding this bit about the bacteria behind rain.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:48):**  But by far the most important in forested area or inland warmer regions where ice and  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:55):**  salt aren't there, are certain bacteria.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:28:58):**  Okay, and these are bacteria that are extremely hygroscopic.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:03):**  Meaning they attract to others.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:05):**  Louis Pasteur identified that hygroscopic, they can suck in lots of moisture molecules  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:12):**  to make a big raindrop.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:14):**  And Louis Pasteur identified them way back in the 1870s, right?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:20):**  Aerobacter.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:21):**  And it's these bacteria.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:23):**  Now these bacteria are formed by forests, certain forests in certain regions.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:30):**  And so the Amazon, for example, is generating these microbial precipitation nuclei.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:38):**  And we've got all the radio labeled data that well over half the rainfall in the Amazon  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:45):**  is driven by the trees releasing these precipitation nuclei.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:51):**  And so we've got this wonderful sort of reality that actually rain is a symbiotic process  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:29:59):**  of vegetation of life.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:02):**  Instead of the other way around, we always hear like it needs to rain to create vegetation,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:06):**  but actually you need vegetation to make it rain.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:09):**  Beautiful.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:10):**  And so we now see this rain, the hydrology.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:13):**  So we see hydrology as a part of a dynamic cycle with vegetation and with soil.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:20):**  And so now we have rain, but if the rain falls on rock, it runs off into the ocean as lost.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:27):**  But if it falls into a well structured, healthy soil, it infiltrates as retained for more  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:34):**  evaporative cooling.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:35):**  And so we've simplified it.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:37):**  So now we have, yeah, transpiration, clouds, rain, soil.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:43):**  And that can actually drive the whole hydrology of the planet.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:47):**  It can drive the whole heat dynamics of the planet.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:51):**  And it can allow us to cool regions.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:53):**  And now let's get practical.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:54):**  I live in Canberra.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:56):**  It's an artificial city, 100 years old.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:30:59):**  It was created as an urban forest.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:03):**  And in a hot summer's day, as we're already getting now, 40 degrees centigrade, it's 12  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:09):**  degrees centigrade cooler.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:12):**  In that urban forest areas compared to bare concrete heat island regions, three, four,  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:18):**  five kilometers away.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:20):**  That's a lot.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:21):**  That's a big difference.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:22):**  So we've got natural air conditioning of 12 degrees centigrade in an urban habitat simply  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:30):**  because of this water cycle effect.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:32):**  I always feel uneasy about the tunnel vision focus on carbon dioxide in relation to the  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:38):**  climate crisis.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:39):**  To be clear, I don't think this is an excuse for business as usual when it comes to fossil  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:44):**  fuels or anything like that.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:47):**  That is a form of extraction and land degradation in itself.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:50):**  And there's just no doubt we need to move away from fossil fuels.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:31:55):**  However, I do feel very unsure or uneasy about the linear and transactional approach we're  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:04):**  taking to carbon, such as through carbon markets and carbon offsetting.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:09):**  And so I'm excited by Walter's thinking because it's embracing the fact that carbon is one  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:15):**  part of a complex interlinked system.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:18):**  And he shows that land regeneration, healthy soils and vegetation cover can have multiple  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:24):**  benefits in this complex system.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/64-dung-beetles-herbal-medicine-hydrology-and-soil-carbon#t=0:32:28):**  It's clear that we need to recognize this is about so much more than just carbon.

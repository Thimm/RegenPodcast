### Farmerama  (2018-11-04)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this special interview with author, activist and farmer, Leah Penniman.  This Farmerama podcast is brought to you by Chelsea Green Publishing and Leah Penniman's  Farming While Black.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:28):**  In 1920, there were 925,000 black farmers owning 16 million acres of land, 14% of the  US farmland.  By 1970, 90% of the farmers and the farmland were lost to the black community.  
**[0:00:45-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:00:45):**  It was almost as if the earth was opening up and swallowing black farmers, wrote scholar  Pete Daniel in his book, Dispossession.  Leah Penniman's book, Farming While Black, published by Chelsea Green Publishing, invites  
**[0:01:01-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:01):**  us all to look at the history and practice of sustainable agriculture with new eyes.  In the words of Malcolm X, revolution is based on land.  Land is the basis of all independence.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:16):**  Land is the basis of freedom, justice and equality.  Leah's book is a manifesto and a manual, it includes recipes, wisdom from diasporic  African farmers and practical techniques for setting up a small-scale farm.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:33):**  And it's a call to action, because at its core, it's a celebration of people of colour  reclaiming agency in the food system.  A key part of this celebration are the songs of the land, and most of the songs featured  
**[0:01:48-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:01:48):**  in this episode are recordings made by Leah with friends on her farm.  I've yet to read any book that centres the black farmer as we.  The only books that I've read about us really paint, they're requiems, they're requiems  
**[0:02:03-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:03):**  for us about how we're disappearing, but they're not about how to reclaim that place of agency  in the food system and belonging to the land.  So my hope for black farmers is that this is a book that's both an inspiration as well  
**[0:02:16-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:16):**  as a practical manual for finding our way home to our rightful place of dignity on the  land.  And my hope for the broader community is that this book is an opportunity to rethink the  
**[0:02:31-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:31):**  narrative we have about the place of black people in sustainable agriculture.  That's an opportunity to give credit where it's due and to uplift the dignity and the  noble contributions of black people to the sustainable farming movement.  
**[0:02:50-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:02:50):**  After midnight on October 4th, 1908, 50 hooded white men surrounded the home of a black farmer  in Hinckman, Kentucky and ordered him to come out for a whipping.  When David Walker refused and shot at them instead, the mob poured coal oil on his house  
**[0:03:08-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:08):**  and set it afire, according to contemporary newspaper accounts.  Pleading for mercy, Walker ran out the front door followed by four screaming children and  his wife carrying a baby in her arms.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:22):**  The mob shot them all, wounding three children and killing the others.  Walker's oldest son never escaped the burning house.  No one was ever charged with the killings and the surviving children were deprived of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:34):**  the farm their father died defending.  Record records show that Walker's two and a half acre farm was simply folded into the  property of a white neighbor.  
**[0:03:44-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:03:44):**  The neighbor soon sold it to another man whose daughter owns the undeveloped land today.  While farming was initially healing for me, for many African heritage people it is a triggering  and re-traumatizing experience.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:11):**  Almost without exception, when I ask black visitors to Soul Fire Farm what they first  associate with farming, they respond, slavery or plantation.  As Chris Bolden Newsom says, the field was the scene of the crime.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:25):**  Hundreds of years of enslavement have devastated our sacred connection to land and overshadowed  thousands of years of our noble autonomous farming history.  Many of us have confused the terror our ancestors experienced on land with the land herself,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:41):**  naming her the oppressor and running toward paved streets without looking back.  We do not stoop, sweat, harvest or even get dirty because we imagine that would revert  us to bondage.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:04:55):**  And yet we are keenly aware that something is missing, that a gap exists where once there  was connection.  This generation of black people is becoming known as the returning generation of agrarian  
**[0:05:06-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:06):**  people.  Our grandparents fled the red clays of Georgia and we are now cautiously working to make  sense of a reconciliation with lands.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:16):**  We somehow know that without the lands we cannot return to freedom.  Farming found me by accident.  I was always a young person who felt deeply connected to nature because the forest was  
**[0:05:32-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:32):**  a friend and solace when my peers in school certainly were anything but.  So when it came time to get my first job as a teenager, I saw a flyer for the food project  at my mom's church and went for the interview and was lucky enough to land a position where  
**[0:05:50-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:05:50):**  my role was to do things like harvest cilantro and prepare soups for people without houses  and folks experiencing domestic violence.  And that elegant simplicity of planting and reaping and providing food for the community  
**[0:06:06-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:06):**  was a beautiful antidote to all the confusion and identity crises and wondering if I belonged  of my teenage years.  When I wasn't farming there was a way that my thoughts and my heart would be swirling  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:20):**  in confusion.  I would be wondering, you know, is life really worth living?  Am I going to be successful?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:27):**  Do I belong?  Does anyone care about me?  So all of these thoughts would always be consuming me.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:32):**  But as soon as I started farming, as soon as I was in contact with the soil or even  when I was preparing food for people who needed it in the Boston community, that chatter quieted  down.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:43):**  There was an undeniable good to the work, an undeniable meaning to the work.  And by logical extension, if this thing that my hands could do meant something to the world,  then I must also mean something to the world.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:06:58):**  So it was not just about learning the skills of farming, but it was very much about healing  my sense of purpose and worth as a teen.  I can feel my heartbeat beating to the rhythm of the freedom song.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:14):**  If I say yes to the beating in me, I can set my spirit free.  I can feel my heartbeat beating to the rhythm of the freedom song.  If I say yes to the beating in me, I can set my spirit free.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:30):**  Leah has been farming for over 20 years and she's moved through a lot of ups and downs  in that time.  She now lives and works at Soul Fire Farm, a place with community at its core.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:43):**  Soul Fire Farm also found us in many ways.  We were living then in the south end of Albany, which is classified as a food desert by the  United States Department of Agriculture, which means that it's a high poverty census track  
**[0:07:57-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:07:57):**  and also a place where there aren't grocery stores or farmers markets.  So my partner Jonah and I were living there with our very young children.  Nishima was two and Emmett was a newborn.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:09):**  And despite our years of farming experience and our education privilege, we found it very  difficult to find the food we needed to give our children the right kind of nourishment.  And so eventually we joined a farm share CSA that cost more than our rent for us and it  
**[0:08:27-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:27):**  was over two miles away.  So without a car that meant walking up a hill with a newborn on the back and the two-year-old  in the stroller and then piling all these vegetables on top of the two-year-old and  
**[0:08:38-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:38):**  then going back and preparing the food.  And so when our neighbors found out that we knew how to farm, they really encouraged us  to create a farm for the people, meaning to create a farm that would focus on getting  
**[0:08:51-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:08:51):**  fresh vegetables and food to our neighbors and to folks who were excluded from the benefits  of the food system.  We always knew we wanted to have a farm one day, but that was a moment of accountability  
**[0:09:04-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:04):**  and mission formation for us.  So in speaking with our neighbors in the south end of Albany, it was revealed that there  are really two main barriers to accessing good food.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:16):**  And believe it or not, it has nothing to do with education.  It has nothing to do with desire to eat good food.  The two barriers are transportation and money.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:27):**  So when we designed our farm share CSA, we decided to deliver the vegetables right to  people's doorstep so folks didn't have to have a car or go somewhere out of their neighborhood  to get the food.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:38):**  That box shows up every Wednesday right where they tell us to leave it.  And to address the issue of money while still maintaining financial viability as a farm,  which is really important to us, we adopted a sliding scale model, which means that if  
**[0:09:51-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:09:51):**  you have more, you pay more.  If you have less, you pay less.  So people choose the amount that they can afford for their vegetables, eggs, sprout,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:00):**  chicken meats.  And we don't check anybody's paperwork.  It's all based on the honor system.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:07):**  But we found that folks are very generous.  So people tend to contribute as much as they possibly can.  And we have a number of folks in the community who contribute toward what we call solidarity  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:17):**  shares.  So that's when a family pays the full cost of a season-long share for someone who really  can't pay anything at all.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:25):**  And we give away those solidarity shares to refugees, immigrants, and folks impacted by  incarceration and criminal injustice in our community.  And we have about 15 people right now who get completely free shares and deliveries.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:41):**  Thank you for this land.  Thank you for this land.  Thank you for this land.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:10:50):**  Thank you for this land.  This healing, this healing, this healing land.  This healing, this healing, this healing land.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:04):**  So even though we drive through some wealthier neighborhoods, we do not stop there to drop  off the boxes.  We only do doorstep delivery in zip codes that are USDA food deserts.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:16):**  And we require that folks who are middle and high income get their boxes from those low-income  neighborhoods.  First of all, because they can, you know, so it's fair for us to expect that those with  
**[0:11:27-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:27):**  resource use their resource.  But also it becomes an awakening moment because for a lot of these higher income families,  they don't have the opportunity to visit neighborhoods that experience economic disadvantage.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:42):**  And so it's a reminder about that dichotomy that exists in society and hopefully a catalyst  for both compassion and action.  The idea of food deserts is well known, but Leah prefers a different term.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:11:56):**  Food apartheid is a term that was taught to me by my mentor, Karen Washington of Risen  Root Farm.  It refers to the fact that the system we have right now, which relegates certain people  
**[0:12:07-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:07):**  to food opulence and others to food scarcity, really isn't metaphorically a desert because  a desert is a natural phenomenon.  It's a biodiversity rich biome.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:19):**  It has a place in the earth, a noble place, whereas apartheid is a human created system  of segregation.  And that's really what we have where your zip code, which is very much determined by  
**[0:12:30-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:30):**  a legacy of redlining and racist zoning policies in turn determines your access to food.  And there's nothing natural about that.  It's a human created system and it can be a system that we dismantle and redesign so  
**[0:12:44-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:44):**  that there truly is equity and access for all people.  As a young farmer, the only historical information I had about sustainable agriculture was centering  white folks and particularly men.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:12:58):**  So I knew about Eliot Coleman and John Jeavons and the Nearing's, but I had no idea about  the contributions of Cleopatra or Fannie Lou Hamer, Booker T. Watley or George Washington  Carver.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:09):**  So it was so essential for me as part of reclaiming our belonging in the story to do the anthropological  research about our contributions.  So for example, Dr. George Washington Carver of Tuskegee Institute was one of the founders  
**[0:13:27-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:27):**  of regenerative agriculture, which is also known as organic agriculture.  He taught his students that they should use the peanuts and other leguminous crops in  a rotation with more extractive crops as a way of restoring nitrogen to the soil.  
**[0:13:43-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:13:43):**  He also taught diversified horticulture, composting, mulching, the use of wild crafting and wild  foraging for livestock.  And so he was just well beyond his time in terms of restoring and honoring indigenous  
**[0:14:01-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:01):**  ways of farming in a commercial agricultural context.  George Washington Carver's contribution to the sustainable agriculture movement is just  one of many examples that Leah refers to as uplift stories.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:17):**  Farming While Black is the story of a whole community being called into action.  Leah talks about building a movement and being an effective leader.  And she creates a picture of a global network of farmers working to increase farmland stewardship  
**[0:14:33-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:33):**  by people of colour.  A vital part of this is Soul Fire Farm's education program, the Black Latinx Farmers Immersion  Program.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:42):**  So the idea with BLFI, which we call it for short, is that about 20 folks from all across  the United States and sometimes from other countries come to live and learn together  on the farm for about a week.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:14:56):**  It's a 50 hour training program.  And in that time, not only do we learn all these concrete farming skills, like how do  you measure cation exchange capacity and what's it good for in the soil through chicken processing  
**[0:15:09-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:09):**  and greenhouse management, marketing, business planning.  So it's a really intensive farm training program.  And at the same time, it's a container for healing from the trauma of centuries of land  
**[0:15:21-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:21):**  based oppression.  So we use a lot of African traditional healing modalities like song and dance, herbal baths,  storytelling and deep listening in order to uproot that trauma that's taken hold that  
**[0:15:35-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:35):**  makes us sometimes believe that we don't belong in a life on land.  So we're really building community, we're building our spirit and we're also building  our skills.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:43):**  And once folks graduate from BLFI, they become part of our family or sometimes we call ourselves  our farmily forever and ever.  And so there's ongoing mentorship, opportunities to connect to resources, grants, loans, as  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:15:58):**  well as a speakers collective where folks can be part of spreading the message around  black agrarianism.  So it's been very exciting.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:06):**  We've had over 500 people go through the program.  Almost everyone is continuing to grow food for their community after graduating from  BLFI.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:15):**  And it has a waiting list of hundreds of people every year.  And that's been so important to me because one of the myths that I was told about black  farmers is that we're not interested.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:27):**  We left the red clays of Georgia, moved to the urban streets of the north for a better  life and never looked back.  And black folks just aren't interested in being on the land.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:37):**  But this anecdotal evidence really flies in the face of that myth.  The fact that so many people are lining up over the years to take this program tells  me that we really are in the returning generation of black agrarianism.  
**[0:16:50-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:16:50):**  Yabisi Asili is one of the participants in the youth program.  It was just so beautiful and really, really healing and being around so many people of  color my age.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:00):**  There was this big fire and we were singing like songs and whatnot and playing African  drums.  And we all had, we all have these blankets.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:08):**  I remember snuggling with my god siblings and just looking out the stars.  It was in a big, big field and seeing shooting stars go by and just feeling really, really  appreciated and really present.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:19):**  We would go out and they'd show us different techniques of when farming.  We'd plant seeds and whatnot and we'd harvest vegetables.  And then we would go and we'd have to cook lunch and we'd use the produce that we had  
**[0:17:30-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:30):**  picked and made lunch from that.  And learned about traditional African foods or Latinx foods.  I used to live in the food desert myself.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:39):**  I used to live in downtown Albany, which is a more poor community.  It's probably made up of people of color.  After going to this camp, I realized that farming is more about connecting with your  
**[0:17:50-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:17:50):**  heritage, your ancestry, and these sacred traditions.  It's more than just harvesting vegetables so you can eat them.  It's a very, very sacred practice that our ancestors have been doing for many generations.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:02):**  Some of my peers who, it depends, it's actually very much race oriented, I feel.  Some of my white peers would say that it's just like farming and they're not really  interested.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:11):**  I feel like it's hard to tell them about the rites of passage and whatnot and the more  ancestral part of the farming experience.  But some of my friends who are of color and are either Latinx or African, which I am both,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:25):**  they are really, I feel like they're more receptive, they're more interested in this  experience of farming and whatnot and they want to know more about it and they want to  know more about their traditions.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:36):**  I think they're way more curious about it and they're more intrigued in a lot of ways,  which I find interesting.  Learning more about farming and that your tradition is something that as a young age  
**[0:18:47-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:18:47):**  and as you become a youth is very important in your academic career and discovering your  identity in general.  And they'd say, just learn more about your heritage and learn more about being with the  
**[0:19:00-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:00):**  land and just try farming, whether or not you like it.  I think it's important to try farming and even if you don't like farming, being out  in nature, it gives you the sense of connection.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:10):**  That's very important.  I want to be free, so free, like a flower and a bee, like a bird up in a tree, like  a dolphin in the sea.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:24):**  I want to fly high, so high, like an eagle in the sky.  And when I come back home, I want to spread my wings and fly.  Bacha mama, I'm coming home to the place where I belong.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:19:49):**  Bacha mama, I'm coming home to the place where I belong.  So this was a few years back.  We had a group of teens out to the farm and as is typical, many of them did not want to  
**[0:20:08-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:08):**  get out of the van because they were afraid of the bugs and the sunshine and the dirt  and all the unfamiliarity and all the scary stories told about rural spaces.  So the fear was legitimate.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:21):**  Dijor was one of these young people and when we did eventually coax Dijor out of the van,  he had his hood up and his earbuds in and he did not want to engage with our cheesy  opening circle where we had everyone select an element in nature that represented them  
**[0:20:36-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:36):**  and share out.  He just wasn't having any part of that.  And when we went on the tour, Dijor was so afraid of getting his sneakers dirty that  
**[0:20:44-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:20:44):**  he acquiesced and decided to come along and take off his shoes in order to preserve the  sneakers, preserve the beautiful whites of his new kicks.  And he came with us and had this most powerful experience while following along.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:04):**  He said when we finished up the tour that his grandmother visited him through the soles  of his bare feet when they were in contact with the earth, that she entered through his  feet up into his heart and reminded him of a time when she was still alive, when he was  
**[0:21:22-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:22):**  young and they garden together and she would place worms and insects and elements of nature  into his bare hands.  And at that time he wasn't afraid.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:33):**  So he remembered a time of not being afraid of nature, of really belonging in a time of  being connected to his mother and to the earth.  So he shed some tears in our closing circle sharing this and that gave permission for  
**[0:21:45-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:45):**  the other young people to be in their vulnerability and also share memories of their grandparents  and relatives and times of feeling connected.  And these youth were actually part of a youth filming program and ended up creating a documentary  
**[0:21:58-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:21:58):**  in honor of their grandmothers which was one of the most touching and beautiful experiences  that I had mentoring young people at the farm.  So at that time we were molds and sebagaihke, but that we were really part of that and  
**[0:22:21-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:21):**  thatmetal.  We wanted to let people know that our park real opportunity to take part in the carnival  Ibolele, Ibolele, oh, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolele,  
**[0:22:51-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:22:51):**  Ibolele, Ibolele, oh, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo, Ibolelela, tibonitkramumbazweyo.  Traditions and rituals are core to Leah's way of farming. For her, spirituality is an  integral part of everyday activities on the farm, and that includes singing. Most of the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:25):**  songs you've heard in this episode were sung at Soul Fire Farm by Leah and her friends.  So yeah, there were some elders of mine in Ghana who were incredulous to know that many  farmers in the United States do not integrate any type of rituals or reverence or song or  
**[0:23:43-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:23:43):**  dance into the cycle of their year. They just couldn't imagine how crops would spring forth  from the earth with such disrespect. And so that's the framework that I'm coming with.  And I'm certainly a learner. There's times when I forget and revert to this colonized  
**[0:24:00-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:00):**  perspective of just output, output, output. But we do have festivals that bookend the  year. So in the fall, the harvest festival for Haitian people is called Mangeyam, the  eating of the new yams. For us, it's sweet potatoes because yams don't grow in our climate.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:19):**  There's so many things I love about this festival, and a number of family and friends do come  over and enjoy the harvest with us. But the centerpiece of the ritual is this metaphorical  journey back to Guinea. Guinea is Africa, is the land of the ancestors and the source  
**[0:24:38-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:38):**  of good character. So we put banana leaves out all over the floor and roll from west  to east on the banana leaves with east representing Guinea, which is across the Atlantic Ocean  to the east from us. And when we arrive at this location, which is in our living room,  
**[0:24:58-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:24:58):**  but metaphorically in the land of our ancestors, we receive spiritual instructions and spiritual  renewal and then we roll back across the banana leaves back west to home. And this is deeply  meaningful. It's also super fun. If you can imagine a whole bunch of five to nine year  
**[0:25:14-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:14):**  olds rolling all over banana leaves and getting tangled up in them and bumping into each other,  it's really delightful. And then after that ritual, we get to enjoy the feast and we eat  yams and we also eat fish to represent the harvest of the sea as well as the harvest  
**[0:25:31-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:31):**  of the land. There is no culture devoid of planting and harvest rituals. And I think  one of the myths of white supremacy is to erase the indigenous cultural heritage of  all of us. So even folks from the UK, folks from Europe, folks with white skin, if you  
**[0:25:54-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:25:54):**  reach back, you know, pre-Roman, pre-Greco Empire, you will see that there's indigenous  ways of being that are very connected to the earth. And it might take talking to our great  grandparents that might take reading some books. But I think it's really important for  
**[0:26:10-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:10):**  us to be rooted in our own cultural traditions. It can be so easy to just borrow from others.  You know, the Manja Yom Festival was not passed down to me when my grandparents came from  Haiti to the United States. They were really keen on assimilating and so didn't teach  
**[0:26:27-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:27):**  their children French or Creole, didn't even cook a lot of the traditional foods. So it  took my sister and I, you know, going back to Haiti and learning from elders about what  those traditions were that we had lost and then reviving them. And that's something I  
**[0:26:42-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:42):**  really encourage all of us to do. I think it also makes a lot of sense for us to find  rituals that come from our own hearts and minds. And so it can be really simple. It  can just be singing a song of thanks or, you know, taking the time to touch the earth in  
**[0:26:59-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:26:59):**  a reverent way before putting seed. It doesn't have to be elaborate and complicated. It's  about that pause that really recognizes the sanctity and sovereignty of the moment of  planting and the moment of harvest. Farming can be repetitive, you know, harvesting all  
**[0:27:15-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:15):**  day, weeding all day. And so singing brings joy and connection. I think it reminds us  that the work we're doing isn't just material and helps us transcend into a place of heart  and spirit. And a lot of the songs that we sing intersect with what we're talking about  
**[0:27:31-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:31):**  before around spirituality and praise. These are songs of thanks for our breath and for  the majesty of the soil and the fecundity of the water. So in singing, I think we connect  ourselves to the deeper meaning of the work that we're doing.  
**[0:27:48-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:27:48):**  The ocean is the beginning of the world. The ocean is the beginning of the world. All life  comes from the sea. All life comes from the sea.  I think I would be remiss not to mention Black indigenous solidarity in this narrative. And  
**[0:28:17-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:17):**  one story really illustrates that for me. The crop that is arguably most sacred to the  Haitian people, to my ancestors, is the Jumu pumpkin. And that's because this pumpkin is  so delicious and the white French enslavers would not allow us to taste it during the  
**[0:28:34-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:34):**  period of enslavement. So after our successful revolution in 1804, the celebration was to  make the soup Jumu, this amazing, delicious soup that represents both freedom and also  the justice and liberation. But this pumpkin was gifted to us by the Taino people, by indigenous  
**[0:28:56-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:28:56):**  people. And in exchange, Black people gave the Taino folks one of our special beans,  which is the black-eyed pea. And that alliance has woven itself throughout history. We've  had our ups and downs in terms of really being in solidarity with each other because it is  
**[0:29:15-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:15):**  a colonial project to divide Black and indigenous people from each other. But right now we're  in a period, a really hopeful period of, again, building solidarity and alliances. And so  we're working with a number of indigenous communities across the Northeast of the United  
**[0:29:29-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:29):**  States to form a land trust together. And that land trust would receive reparations  gifts and make them available to Black indigenous growers and earth stewards as a way of regaining  some of the land that was stolen from us during the centuries of settler colonialism.  
**[0:29:50-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:29:50):**  This has been just a small taster of Farming While Black. Before we said goodbye, we asked  Leah if there was anything she wanted to add. My message to all of us who tend the land  is not to get discouraged by the corporate attempts to take over our food system. Smallholders  
**[0:30:10-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:10):**  still produce 70% of the world's food. We are the past and we also are the future of  feeding the entire planet in a way that doesn't destroy our ecological base. So just keep  at it. We're part of the long view of history and we're already winning even on days when  
**[0:30:31-0:30:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:31):**  we can't feel it. Farming While Black is a powerful reminder  that farming is inherently and inevitably political and spiritual. It's a book that  compels you to acknowledge the contribution of people of colour to regenerative agriculture  
**[0:30:49-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:30:49):**  over many centuries and it forces you to reconsider the act of farming and the role of farmers  in society. It's a story of one Black woman embracing the land and activating a whole  community to do the same. Leah tells the wisdom of her ancestors, fills you with practical  
**[0:31:09-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:09):**  tips for beginner farmers, encourages you to sing and dance and celebrate your roots,  to work together to heal hundreds of years of trauma and she paves the way for people  of colour to reclaim their rightful place of dignified agency in the food system. The  
**[0:31:26-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:26):**  book is at once fiercely political, deeply practical and unashamedly spiritual because  as Leah shows us, farming is all of those things.  When you were born, you cried, and the world rejoiced. Live your life so that when you  
**[0:31:48-0:32:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/leah-penniman-farming-while-black#t=0:31:48):**  die The world cries and you rejoice  When you were born, you cried, and the world rejoiced  Live your life so that when you die, the world cries and you rejoice

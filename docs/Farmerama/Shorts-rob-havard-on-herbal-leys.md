**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:00):**  My name's Rob Havard, I farm about 420 acres in the Worcestershire countryside, 44 acres  owned and we rent the rest off to two main landowners.  Basically we have very species rich meadows and grasslands that we farm to produce organic  beef and also have a pedigree angus herd producing cattle that fit to these grass fed systems  so we're providing value to other farmers, providing them with the stock they need to  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:39):**  thrive in these systems.  Because of winter grazing you end up with some areas that are going to have a little  bit of pasture damage around movable water troughs or also sometimes if a really bad  storm they'll all group together and they will move around like penguins and tread the  ground up.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:56):**  So that opportunity has created a risk as potentially a weed germination site but that  turns into an opportunity to throw some wildflower seed on, it's what I call the love bomb and  then it all comes out, beautiful wildflowers, sorts out the soil structure, lots of deep  rooting herbs and grasses and it's all good, it's all good and that starts spreading around  the pasture and it's all good.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:17):**  A couple of things in terms of harvesting the wildflower seed from other sites or sites  on your own farm is going and collecting the grass seed and the wildflower seed just before  it's all dropped to the floor and just at the right time and you can go in and cut and  collect it or you could take wet hay as in just cut it and take it and go and spread  that on a field, on an arable field you wanted to seed down but maybe you'd already broadcast  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:42):**  some cheap native grass seed on and that will give you a herbal lay much cheaper than going  and buying the seed somewhere else so you can have all that resource on your farm, use  your arable margins to do that.  I've even seen someone at one of the top seed companies now, they started out using a huge  grain bucket on the front of the tractor going into a wildflower meadow, putting it at the  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:08):**  right height, driving like hell in the night with the grain bucket on and it was just collecting  all the seed in there and that's how they started out.  It can be sort of rough, quick and dirty and as long as it works who cares.  We had a 20 acre field that was all ryegrass and clover, just two species, competitive  ryegrass lay and whilst it's productive it doesn't hold the cattle up very well, the  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:35):**  root structure is quite poor and I wanted to terminate that and to use that field as  a bit of a trial so we went in and grazed that last in the wettest time of the year  in terms of our winter rotation and I usually have a back fence so I limit the amount of  damage they can do or the amount of back grazing they can do so we didn't have a back fence  on this field we just kept moving a front fence through and we had some bales fed out  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:00):**  there as well and that effectively terminated the ryegrass, left quite a lot of the clover  there and then we've gone in and broadcast a mix of black oats, forage oats, we've got  a fodder turnip that's a very thin tap-rooted one that's good for compaction and we've also  got fodder radish mixed in there as well and then on top of that we've got some deep rooted  grasses mixed in that seed mix, tall fescue, meadow fescue, cocksfoot, the legumes are  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:30):**  there already and that will give us some quick annual growth that we can either make a quick  silage from, catch that or we can graze through there and we're establishing a more diverse  lay that will then go on and the annuals will probably drop out over time.

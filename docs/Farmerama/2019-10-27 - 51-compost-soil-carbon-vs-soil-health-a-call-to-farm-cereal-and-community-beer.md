**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:18):**  I have a few thoughts on soil health versus soil carbon.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:21):**  We have a rallying cry from a member of La Via Campesina to get us all in action growing  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:26):**  food and we give you a teaser for one of the characters in our upcoming series, Cereal,  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:32):**  which uncovers the secrets behind the bread we eat.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:35):**  Finally, we hear about a community project growing their own beer.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:44):**  Dr David Johnson is a microbiology researcher and associate at the Center for Regenerative  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:49):**  Agriculture and Resilient Systems at Chico State University, California.

**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:00:59):**  for carbon sequestration and improved soil health.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:02):**  He's devised a compost methodology with his partner, Hui-Chin Johnson, called BEAM, Biologically  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:09):**  Enhanced Agricultural Management.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:13):**  Compost is usually thought of as fertilizer, a way of adding nutrients to the soil.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:18):**  BEAM compost is a bit different in that it builds soil health by building soil biology.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:23):**  It replaces soil microbes in soil degraded through extractive agriculture methods.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:29):**  Abby caught up with David and Hui-Chin a few weeks ago at the Climate Underground Conference  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:33):**  at Canney Fork Farms in Tennessee.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:36):**  In the last few years, you've come across something that you're quite excited about.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:43):**  And could you tell me a little bit about that?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:46):**  You know, when was the breakthrough moment or when was a light bulb moment came on and  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:50):**  what does that look like?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:51):**  Well, it started with a job.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:01:52):**  I got at New Mexico State University with an environmental research and education program.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:00):**  Do something good with dairy manure.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:02):**  It was the second day on the job and my boss called me and he says, I've got a project  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:06):**  for you.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:07):**  You can imagine my excitement.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:09):**  Dairy manure.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:13):**  But it turned out a little different than what we expected as far as the results.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:17):**  The people that had it a decade before us, they concluded that the compost they made  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:24):**  from the dairy manure was bad for soils.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:27):**  And we kind of scoffed at that, but looked at the data.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:29):**  They were right.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:31):**  They were putting down a very saline product that was actually stopping plants from growing.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:37):**  So we got the project.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:39):**  I started out doing a similar composting process, the windrow, where we would turn it.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:44):**  And she got tired of me coming in with dirty clothes and she says, we're going to do this  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:51):**  a different way.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:52):**  So we put our heads together and we came up with a bioreactor that's actually static.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:02:57):**  There's no turning involved.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:00):**  You keep the moisture content about 70%.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:03):**  That's optimal, what we found out now, for fungi to grow.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:08):**  It's aerobic because we put it on a pallet and we have tubes that run up the center so  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:13):**  you get circulation up through the center.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:15):**  You're never more than a foot away from ambient air, so the whole process stays aerobic.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:21):**  And we allow it to mature over a year.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:24):**  And it was in that maturity that we saw a change in the diversity of the microbes.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:30):**  The diversity quadrupled in the microbial community as it would mature.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:35):**  We put some of that into some trials, into plant growth trials, and we had extremely  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:41):**  good results seeing plants grow twice with our compost, what any other compost did.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:48):**  We thought we should put this in the field and try that out.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:03:52):**  We tried it in the field and we've been on a plot now for about 12 years.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:00):**  And what we noticed is each year after we had applied, we applied this once.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:05):**  And at that time we were doing it at about 400 pounds per acre, but we've cut back.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:09):**  We don't need to put that much now.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:11):**  It's actually about a pound to two pounds per acre rate.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:16):**  Quite a significant drop.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:18):**  But in that original experiment we saw yearly increase in growth.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:23):**  We only applied once, as I was saying.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:26):**  The management after you apply this is key.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:29):**  You always need to have something growing in these soils because that's what feeds the  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:33):**  microbes and allow them to increase in population and increase in their functionality.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:39):**  And we would see these communities would start to develop, the microbial communities for  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:44):**  nitrogen fixation, both free living and symbiotic nitrogen fixers.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:49):**  We saw microbes that were involved in mobilizing phosphorus.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:55):**  A lot of the soils that we have right now are very, have a lot of phosphorus in them,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:04:59):**  but it's locked up.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:01):**  The soil physical chemistry doesn't allow the plant to access it, but we saw a lot of  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:06):**  microbes that were involved in that releasing that, how that those, the chemical structures  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:12):**  there in and making it accessible to the plant.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:15):**  We saw microbes that were involved with metal oxidation or you could extract, they could  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:21):**  extract all the elements that the plant needed.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:24):**  We saw microbes involved with methane reduction, methanotrophs, nitrous oxide reduction.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:33):**  Not every problem that we have in agriculture and its influence on our ecosystem that we  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:39):**  live in, these microbes seem to be able to address it.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:43):**  We saw also a increase in microbes that do phytohormones.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:50):**  They work with plants to increase plant growth.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:54):**  We saw microbes that would break down about every xenobotic or every chemical that we  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:05:59):**  put on a field, you know, 2,4-D, malathion, all the polychlorinated biphenyls that we  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:06:07):**  see, just almost every chemical that man has made, there's an organism that seems to, that's  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:06:14):**  a food source for it.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:06:16):**  So it's, we just keep going on this, doing the research.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:06:20):**  We see an upregulation in genes that are involved with quorum sensing.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:06:27):**  And quorum sensing is when either a single-species group of microbes get together or a multi-species

**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:28):**  Agent Orange, it was purple when they sprayed me with it, was a defoliant and a herbicide.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:33):**  I was working on a plant breeding project and I thought, no, there's got to be a better  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:37):**  way of doing this.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:38):**  So I switched and went into environmental science and started hanging out with people  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:43):**  who I think had a different perspective and I realized that the problem was not producing  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:49):**  new super varieties.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:50):**  That was just the early days of biotechnology, just the early days of GM.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:55):**  And I said, no, no, no, what we need is more ecological ways of doing this.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:25:59):**  We need to mimic natural ecosystems.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:02):**  So I actually went into ecology and environmental science.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:05):**  So I thought, well, what is this transition from hunting and gathering where we all lived  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:09):**  as natural ecologists in a sense to farming?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:12):**  So I wanted to know more about that transition because obviously our farming systems have  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:16):**  gone very badly wrong and I want to know more about that.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:20):**  So I thought, well, the way getting out that information is through archeology.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:23):**  So I ended up doing environmental archeology, looking at the history of plants.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:27):**  So archeobotany, the short word.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:30):**  And I ended up at UCL and I worked with some amazing people at UCL who really were the  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:34):**  experts on the origins of agriculture.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:35):**  So the first domesticated weeds, how those wild grasses move from being wild into being  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:43):**  domesticated crops.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:44):**  So I worked in Turkey for three summers as an archeologist and on some of the earliest  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:49):**  sites of agriculture because I wanted to understand all the different ways in which this transition  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:55):**  to modern agriculture happened or at least to agriculture happened.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:26:59):**  The later changes in the last century which have I think destroyed agriculture are nothing  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:05):**  to do with ecology or any of the other things.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:07):**  It's all about corporate profit.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:10):**  So I tried to understand that genetically and in all ways.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:14):**  Skipping forward, I ended up at the University of Oxford at the Natural History Museum and  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:18):**  I was working on archeological samples and a friend walked in with a shoebox.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:22):**  He said, oh, this is going to change your life, John.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:25):**  I said, why would that be?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:27):**  He opened up the shoebox and there were about 15 different ears of wheat covered with soot,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:36):**  black.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:37):**  And he said this is from a medieval roof.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:40):**  And there were two other archaeobotanists there.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:42):**  He said this is from a thatched roof and we thought, well, thatch decays.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:45):**  Organic materials will degrade.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:48):**  I didn't know anything about thatch.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:49):**  I'm Canadian.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:50):**  And I didn't realize that every 30 years you just renew the roof, put a new layer on top  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:54):**  of the old and you don't even rake off the old.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:27:57):**  Well you don't do that for the first couple of hundred years because you build up about  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:00):**  a meter and a half thick of thatch and then it becomes one off, one on.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:04):**  But the point is the bottom layer is never replaced.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:07):**  So if you can tell when the building was built and if the building was built in 1350, you've  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:11):**  got a perfectly preserved base coat of medieval wheat from 1350.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:17):**  No one really believed it so I had to prove that.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:20):**  So I did.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:21):**  I went out and I took samples of this ancient thatch from all over and the striking thing  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:25):**  in the shoebox was that every year was different.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:28):**  It was genetic diversity.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:30):**  It was a land race.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:32):**  It was the fact that there was that diversity.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:34):**  And I was writing reports on medieval farming but it's all based on written records, manorial  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:39):**  records, historical accounts and it's all really subject to a lot of bias, historical  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:45):**  bias.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:47):**  But this was a chance to look at the actual medieval crops.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:51):**  In the end I ended up going to the University of Reading because Oxford wasn't particularly  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:55):**  interested to be honest.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:28:56):**  So I ended up at Reading in the plant breeding department and to be quite honest they weren't  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:02):**  particularly interested either in the end because they were all committed to biotechnology,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:06):**  GM again.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:08):**  So I thought well actually it's very scientific to understand the way medieval crops functioned.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:14):**  It's about ecology.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:15):**  Science is a means to an end.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:17):**  I'm a scientist.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:18):**  I wanted to know about the genetics and the ecological dynamics in the field because if  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:23):**  we're going to have truly sustainable farming well we need to mimic those natural systems.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:29):**  And what is a wheat field?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:31):**  Well it's a wild grass ecosystem isn't it from the Middle East?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:35):**  That's what I was thinking, the way I was thinking.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:37):**  So I went through all the English medieval records and tried to make sense of it from  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:43):**  illustrations and paintings.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:45):**  And you can build up quite an interesting picture of what a medieval wheat field looked  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:48):**  like.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:49):**  One of the reasons I did that, well one was the bottom layer of thatch is very well preserved  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:52):**  and often the whole plant is there.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:55):**  Based on that evidence like the ratio of straw to grain I can build up a picture of what  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:29:58):**  they call the harvest index, the ratio of grain to overall plant biomass.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:02):**  So I can basically get to quite an accurate figure on what the yield was of a medieval  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:07):**  field, not just based on manorial records.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:10):**  To do that, to compare with these samples, I started taking wheat out of the gene banks.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:15):**  Without few, we only have a fraction of the genetic diversity that was in our fields that's  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:18):**  been preserved.

**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:25):**  all the thatchers said, well we want this really tall straw.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:27):**  The wheat's six foot tall and tough as nails, this is what we want.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:30):**  Because if they grow modern wheat it's too short, it's full of nitrogen, it's very weak  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:33):**  and it rots.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:34):**  They obviously want a roof to last for 30 years.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:37):**  So I thought, that's great, I can produce thatching straw.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:42):**  I might be able to fund my research that way.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:44):**  I certainly don't want to do GM research here at Redding.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:48):**  But not only that, look at all this lovely grain that's being produced.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:50):**  The waste, the byproduct from the thatching crop is a beautiful flower for making really  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:55):**  interesting historic breads.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:30:57):**  Which of course now you'd call that the artisan bread movement, but 20 years ago they weren't  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:02):**  calling it that.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:04):**  So growing out a thousand different little trial plots of these ancient heritage wheats  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:09):**  was a chore.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:10):**  You've got to plant them by hand, harvest them with a sickle, snip them off and then  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:14):**  thresh them and get the grain out.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:17):**  So I thought, I can't maintain all of this.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:19):**  So why don't I just do what people did in the past, which they grew mixtures, genetically  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:24):**  diverse populations.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:25):**  And ecologically in diversity there is strength.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:30):**  And that's what all ecosystems are.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:32):**  The minute you have uniformity, nature hates uniformity.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:36):**  So okay, I'll make it happen.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:38):**  So that's what I did, I literally mixed all the grains together of all these hundreds  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:41):**  and hundreds of wheats I had.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:44):**  And also I didn't have a farm.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:46):**  I needed somebody to grow them for me.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:48):**  And you can start off with a little tiny handful, 25 seeds, but it will take you five years  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:53):**  to get up to enough that's commercial.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:31:55):**  So if you start off with 500 little handfuls, you've got a little bit of a start.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:00):**  And then nature will just weed out those that aren't adapted.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:03):**  And that's all I did.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:04):**  I started growing all these ancient grains and one thing led to another.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:09):**  And I just kept bulking up the grain.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:12):**  The focus on the thatching straw slightly slipped for now, but I'm going to get back  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:16):**  to it soon, I hope.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:18):**  And since then, then 10 years, let's say, the artisan baking thing has kicked off.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:23):**  So a lot of people got more interested in it for that.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:26):**  But really it's only the last couple of years that it's really worked for me because now  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:29):**  I found that alternative market with the distillation and hopefully the beer.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:34):**  So that was a very long-winded answer, I know.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:35):**  You said something short.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:41):**  We're going to be holding a harvest celebration which will double up as a launch event for  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:46):**  the cereal series in London on the 21st of November and Nottingham on the 29th of November.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:32:54):**  Watch out on Twitter for tickets which will be available soon.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:06):**  Anne Bodkin of Grow Beer has been reworking her community in Brixton Beer through the  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:11):**  Brixton Beer Company since 2012.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:14):**  They grow their own hops and make community beer.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:24):**  So it's the idea of bringing growing and drinking beer together.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:30):**  It's literally bringing those two aspects, but making sure that everybody who's involved  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:37):**  is plays a part.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:39):**  So we nurture the growers, they grow some hops and we collectively act like a patchwork  
**[0:33:46-0:33:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:46):**  farm and then we work with a brewer to brew a, it's called a green hop beer.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:33:54):**  So you literally pick the hops and within an hour the beer is brewed.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:01):**  And it makes a delicious, it's quite a light beer, it's not a heavy flavoured beer, it  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:07):**  hasn't been, the hops because they're freshly picked it's quite a light beer.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:13):**  So we brewed a beer for, since 2011, the project started in 2011 and it started, the idea of  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:21):**  Grow Beer started in central London, a place called Brixton.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:25):**  So we had this idea, we called it the Brixton Beer Company and we had our first brew in  
**[0:34:31-0:34:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:31):**  2012 and we had about 35 growers who contributed, who all grew hops and in September 2012 we  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:44):**  all picked the hops and we took them down to the brewery and the brewer was called Peter  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:48):**  Hayden.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:49):**  We brewed, I think it's 1200 plates in the first year, which we didn't think, which was  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:34:55):**  amazing because we didn't think that we would grow and get any beer for at least three years  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:00):**  because apparently that's what hop farmers do not make beer until about year two or three.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:07):**  Growers tend to absolutely adore and nurture their own plots and what we were interested  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:12):**  in seeing was that if, could we create something which was a collective between all of these  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:19):**  growers that together they kind of, we created something.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:24):**  So we put a call out on social media and sort of said who would like to grow hops?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:32):**  And we were most interested in seeing if people responded to it.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:37):**  So those who respond, who were intrigued by it, became the first growers collectively.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:43):**  So we were all growers, including the brewer, he grew as well and it was like we were doing  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:49):**  this collective single activity.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:52):**  We had half the people who were intrigued by the question had never grown a single thing  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:56):**  in their life, which was phenomenal.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:35:58):**  They were intrigued by the idea and that's the kind of people we wanted to work with.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:04):**  The actual act of growing is really straightforward and it's a rhizome so it's really kind of  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:10):**  got really nurtured roots, gnarly roots and it's relatively easy but things can go wrong  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:17):**  throughout the year but that's like any hop.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:19):**  So it's relatively easy, yeah.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:21):**  About six months later we got invited to the London Brewing Alliance at Fuller's Brewery  
**[0:36:32-0:36:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:32):**  and we basically wanted to test out the next part of the project which was finding a brewer.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/51-compost-soil-carbon-vs-soil-health-a-call-to-farm-cereal-and-community-beer#t=0:36:42):**  So we turned up one night and the Fuller's Brewery in their tap room was full of every

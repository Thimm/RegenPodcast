**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:00):**  Every year on the second weekend of June, my father Dagger, who's a musician as well as  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:19):**  a farmer, packs up his instruments and sets off from the farm to drive two hours west  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:25):**  along the shores of Loch Ness and through the Great Glen to the west coast of Scotland,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:30):**  where him and his bandmates catch a small foot ferry across to the Isle of Egg.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:37):**  He only plays one gig a year with the Yamaha Kaley Band, the annual party to celebrate  
**[0:00:42-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:42):**  Egg's Independence Day.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:52):**  In 1997, the community of Egg successfully bought their island from a private landowner,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:00:58):**  and since then, Egg has become possibly the most iconic of all the community land buyers  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:03):**  that have happened across the west of Scotland over the past 25 years.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:07):**  I have often joined my dad to celebrate with the islanders, and Egg has become an inspiration  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:12):**  to me.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:13):**  This was the very first place that made me think that there could be different ways and  
**[0:01:18-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:18):**  different possibilities for how to go about owning, governing and managing land.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:40):**  This is Landed from Farmerama.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:45):**  Part 4 – Places of Possibilities  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:01:59):**  My name's Col.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:00):**  I'm a farmer's son from the Scottish Highlands.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:03):**  For a long time, I've been working towards a vision of a just agroecological future,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:08):**  where food production works in sympathy with the rest of the natural world, whilst making  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:12):**  good, nutritious food that's accessible to everyone in society.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:17):**  The goal was always to find a way of farming that's good for our ecosystems, good for  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:21):**  biodiversity, and good for our climate, while at the same time making food that's healthy,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:26):**  affordable and convenient.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:29):**  This is not where I see us heading if we continue on our current trajectory.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:36):**  We're already starting to see an even greater concentration of landownership – a widening  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:41):**  gap between factories of food production and uninhabited wilderness, and deepening inequities  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:48):**  in access to good food.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:50):**  I used to think the small family farm was the answer.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:54):**  But this past year, I've been delving deep into the legacies of the landscape around  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:02:58):**  me, and I've started to question some of my long-held assumptions.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:02):**  By digging where I stand, here in the Scottish Highlands, I've started to understand how  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:06):**  the family farm can be seen as a colonial concept.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:11):**  I've learnt that before the family farm, there was an indigenous relationship to the  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:15):**  land in the Highlands that was very different.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:20):**  This practice of collective management across vast territories was destroyed just a few  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:25):**  hundred years ago through colonial processes – the intentional destruction of indigenous  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:30):**  Gaelic culture, and the privatisation and partialing up of land that this allowed.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:36):**  But the trauma that's embedded in the Highland landscape as a result of this is just one  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:41):**  manifestation of a global pattern of trauma, much of which the Gaels and other Scots were  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:48):**  themselves responsible for as we plundered and profited from the dispossession of other  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:53):**  cultures and their lands in the name of empire building.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:03:58):**  The legacy of this lives on in our overwhelmingly white rural spaces, and we need to start to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:03):**  heal this trauma.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:05):**  We also need to find meaningful ways for more people to connect with and live on the land  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:10):**  if we're going to build a positive agroecological future that's accessible to all and has  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:15):**  racial equity at its heart.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:18):**  We need to begin to imagine ways to move towards different types of landscapes, post-colonial  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:24):**  landscapes.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:25):**  And I can't help but feel that time is running out.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:33):**  The average UK farmer now is 59 years old, and many don't have clear succession plans.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:39):**  Many farms are already disappearing very quickly, and it's likely that huge amounts of farmland  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:44):**  will be coming onto the open market in the next decade in a way we've not seen for generations.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:50):**  The price of land means that there are very, very few people who will be able to bid for  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:04:55):**  these farms, and so we get locked into this pattern of consolidation, intensification,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:01):**  and concentration of ownership.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:05):**  So how do we move forward?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:08):**  We have a very short window of time to come up with some fairly big answers.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:16):**  Luckily, we don't have to start from scratch.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:22):**  There are ideas not only in our past, but in our current legislation and land practices  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:28):**  here in Scotland today, that if harnessed in the right way could hold some keys to a  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:33):**  just agroecological future.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:39):**  I guess there's two things about the scale.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:43):**  One is that that is the natural scale and the way that our ecosystems work.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:50):**  They work because they are joined together.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:53):**  So you can't take it apart and say, okay, well, I'm only going to concentrate on this  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:57):**  part.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:05:58):**  It doesn't make any sense because it is a system that has multiple parts to it in order  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:03):**  for it to work all together.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:05):**  Dr. Marion Bruce is a biologist, farmer, and distiller based in Perthshire, who is part  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:10):**  of an initiative called Bioregioning Tayside.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:13):**  A bioregion is a place defined by its natural features, such as geology, topography, climate,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:20):**  soils, and watersheds, and so on.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:23):**  Marion and others aim to build community resilience by working at this landscape scale, rather  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:28):**  than the fragmented political or economic boundaries of councils, constituencies, or  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:35):**  individual properties we tend to use today.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:37):**  But I suppose the other point about scale is that actually given that we are at this  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:42):**  moment of crisis in both climate change and biodiversity loss, that actually we need to  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:49):**  be acting on that kind of scale in order to have sufficient impact to address these problems.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:06:56):**  There's no point actually just thinking about a small scale level.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:00):**  But I think what's interesting is that from looking at these sectors from the outside,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:05):**  that not everybody's talking to each other.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:08):**  There's plans going on within agriculture, there's plans going on within conservation,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:12):**  there's tourism plans, there's forestry plans, but actually none of them are integrated.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:17):**  And by thinking about it in a bioregional way, it's a way of thinking, I suppose, that  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:22):**  allows you to recognise the role of all of those different elements in a landscape scale  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:28):**  approach.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:29):**  But also, and really importantly, allows communities and people who are living in the bioregion  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:35):**  to collaborate and come to a shared plan as to how to do that.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:42):**  After speaking to Marion, I couldn't help but see the parallels between the landscape  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:46):**  scale of bioregions and the old highland idea of territories I've been learning about.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:51):**  And it struck me that these traditions may hold some useful lessons about how to collaborate  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:07:56):**  at scale to tackle these big modern challenges.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:00):**  Whilst clan territories no longer exist, there still are some pockets throughout the highlands  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:05):**  and islands that have managed to maintain some elements of how this system would have  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:09):**  worked.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:10):**  Elfin is in the northwest of Scotland.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:13):**  We're not on the coast, we're one of the few townships that's actually not on the coast.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:16):**  Helen O'Keeffe moved to Elfin from Australia six years ago in order to Croft.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:21):**  The area that we live, the northwest highlands, has the lowest population density in Western  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:26):**  Europe.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:27):**  So it is a very sparsely populated landscape.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:31):**  There's some lovely stunning hills.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:32):**  Most of the rock is very old and relatively flat and very poor ground.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:38):**  There's huge expanses of mostly bog, and bog is a good thing, so we don't hate bog here,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:43):**  bog is lovely, with small townships and they're usually crofting townships scattered throughout  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:50):**  a lot of the land that people see and they just see as wild land or untouched land has  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:08:58):**  actually been farmed and managed by people for hundreds and thousands of years.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:03):**  And most of it is still actually under active management today.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:07):**  I asked Helen to explain to me what crofting is.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:10):**  Crofting is a form of landholding in mainly the north and the west of Scotland.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:14):**  So generally what you have is you have small townships with a series of small fields by  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:20):**  the road and around the houses, and then a large area of common ground further out behind  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:26):**  them on the hill or along the beach.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:28):**  So the fields themselves are what we call the crofts, and then each croft comes with  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:34):**  an associated share of the hill ground.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:36):**  So your croft might give you the right to graze 50 sheep on the hill.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:41):**  So if you've got two crofts, you can have 100, you know, that type of thing.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:45):**  Probably almost all of the land is privately owned by large landowners, most of whom don't  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:50):**  live here, but most of the land is also under crofting tenure.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:09:55):**  So what that means is that the people in the villages who own crofts and have the rights  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:01):**  to that common grazing, they don't own the land, but they have the agricultural management  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:05):**  of it.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:06):**  So crofting is a very specific legal definition, and there's a whole actual, several Acts,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:13):**  written about crofting law.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:16):**  Crofting as a system was first written into law in 1886.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:19):**  At the time, the goal was to give tenant farmers better protections against evictions and unfair  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:24):**  treatment they'd experienced since the fall of the clan system some hundred years earlier.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:30):**  This law is sometimes seen as marking the end of the era of Highland clearances.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:35):**  Today there are around 20,000 crofts across Scotland.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:39):**  I asked Patrick Krause, the chief executive of the Scottish Crofting Federation, to explain  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:44):**  to me how crofting differs from smallholding or farming and what the basic principles of  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:50):**  crofting law are.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:52):**  Most smallholders are freeholders.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:10:55):**  They just own the land, whereas crofting still is predominantly tenanted, and the law was  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:03):**  designed for that relationship between a landlord and a tenant.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:08):**  I'm sure a lot of people listening to this will think, yeah, but if you've got the chance  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:11):**  to buy it, why wouldn't you?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:13):**  But that's sort of a mentality that we just have in society, that we want to own things.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:18):**  And I think crofting is very interesting from that point of view.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:23):**  Even though crofters can buy crofts, most don't.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:27):**  There is actually a very strong feeling still within crofting that the idea of ownership  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:32):**  of land is a bit sort of strange.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:35):**  Why would you need something that says you own a bit of land?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:38):**  If you have the right to use it for grazing your animals or growing your crops, then that's  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:44):**  fine.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:45):**  Patrick talked me through the basic principles that give tenants or crofters their security  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:50):**  of tenure.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:51):**  He told me that it's very, very hard to remove a crofter from their croft, and the laws are  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:57):**  there to give this protection.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:11:59):**  Another important protection is that the rents are controlled.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:03):**  They're set by the crofting regulator, so the landlord can't just keep jacking up the  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:08):**  rent.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:09):**  And if the crofter thinks that the rents are unfair, they can appeal to the land court.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:14):**  What's more, if a crofter has to, for whatever reason, leave their croft, the landlord has  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:20):**  to compensate them for any improvements that they've carried out on the land.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:25):**  And a final principle is that the tenancy is heritable.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:29):**  So if they want to, a crofter can pass on their tenancy to their children, or have a  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:34):**  say in passing it to someone outside the family too.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:38):**  And then in return for these protective regulations, the crofter also has some responsibilities.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:46):**  So they have to keep the croft in good heart.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:50):**  They have to use it in the law.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:52):**  It's called purposeful use.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:12:54):**  I think a lot of people look at a regulated system like this as something very good, because  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:02):**  you know, the people that are using the land can feel fairly secure, but also they're obliged  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:08):**  to use the land for purposeful use.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:11):**  As well as these legal protections, something else that sets crofting apart from smallholding  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:16):**  or the family farm is that cooperation and community are at its heart.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:21):**  It is still how the crofting is supposed to work.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:23):**  You know, you can put in woodlands together, you can do agri-environment schemes together.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:29):**  You know, you can choose to manage the hill ground together.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:32):**  And you know, the cattle and the sheep are out there together.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:35):**  So we could look at how they grazed, where we grazed them to improve the land together.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:41):**  In the fields themselves, again, most people have their own fields, although people will  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:44):**  borrow other people's fields at particular times of the year.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:48):**  You know, the sheep need it for lambing, the cows go in at a different time sometimes.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:53):**  This is a hybrid model, combining individually managed fields and small crofts with the collectively  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:13:59):**  managed commons.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:01):**  When the original crofting laws were being formed, it was recommended that townships,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:05):**  rather than the individual crofts, were recognized as single units.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:09):**  And until relatively recently, it was very common for this to be the way that townships  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:14):**  functioned.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:15):**  So the way the crofting is set up, when you look at the practicalities of it, we've got  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:20):**  small fields which we can use for our own exclusive use, and then we have a hill ground  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:24):**  that we have to manage communally.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:26):**  We've got a grazings committee that sort of manages that and shareholders get to vote  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:30):**  on things.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:31):**  These communal hill grazings are excellent working examples of the commons.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:36):**  In 2009, the Nobel Prize for Economics was won by Eleanor Ostrom for her work analyzing  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:42):**  and documenting how commons across the globe are governed and managed.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:47):**  This recognition has generated a surge of interest in the commons as an idea, what they  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:51):**  mean and how they work.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:54):**  The common grazings, which are a key part of most crofting communities, have their own  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:14:58):**  sets of rules and regulations and governance principles, and they've been managed communally  
**[0:15:03-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:03):**  in this way since crofting townships were established many centuries ago.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:13):**  Usually sitting at or near the coast, traditional crofting townships usually have croft houses  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:19):**  arranged in a linear fashion along a road, and each one of these will have an attached  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:24):**  croft of a few acres of fields for private use called in-by, and then beyond this would  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:30):**  be a more extensive, rough, communal ground called the out-by.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:36):**  And that comes from back when they were set up, when it was people living and working  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:39):**  together a lot more, and that is probably a key difference between how you'd normally  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:45):**  see crofting and how you would quite often see small holdings, because a lot of hill  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:49):**  farms or even small holdings, you're often trying to put the house as far away from the  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:15:53):**  other people as you can, and it's very much an individual, isolated system, whereas crofting,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:01):**  particularly in the north and the west and the isles, where it's much more in its traditional  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:05):**  form, it was the township working together to get everything done.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:09):**  So that sort of centralised but then shared outer areas was, you know, it's a fairly key  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:15):**  part of it.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:17):**  The other thing about crofting is it's generally on really, really poor land, so we can't farm  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:23):**  a lot of the stuff that they do on farms and small holdings further south.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:28):**  Crofting today is only found in the north and west highlands, and also the western and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:32):**  northern isles.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:34):**  As Helen says, crofting is almost always limited to very poor and marginal land.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:39):**  In spite of this, these crofts can be incredibly productive, but it takes a whole township  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:45):**  to work together.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:49):**  Although this collaboration is hard-coded into the crofting model and culture, this  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:53):**  sense of cooperation has drastically declined in recent decades.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:16:59):**  In 2020, Helen was named Young Crofter of the Year, and she's part of a new generation  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:05):**  of crofters reviving and reinventing this spirit of collaboration in the 21st century.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:12):**  So everything from the croft here we sell directly to customers.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:16):**  So I sell the meat from my sheep directly to customers, eggs and also the vegetables.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:20):**  One of my neighbours in the township here, she's got pigs and cows and also chickens  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:24):**  and ducks, and she's also been selling the meat and the eggs directly to customers locally.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:30):**  There's a lot of other people who grow a lot of vegetables, really, really amazing vegetable  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:34):**  growers.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:35):**  So a couple of years ago, we got together and we decided we needed another outlet, and  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:41):**  we started a small farm shop in the cafe that we have here on site.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:46):**  And we had this idea that as a collective, we could do more.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:49):**  When COVID struck, Helen and the township decided to pivot and set up an online shop,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:17:55):**  working together as a community under a single brand, the Green Bowl, which is Elfin's nickname.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:01):**  The goal was to try and give as much flexibility and as much convenience to our customers as  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:05):**  possible because that's really important to have people buy local food is to make it as  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:10):**  easy as possible for them.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:12):**  We were producing this amazing food here, and that's partly what crofting has traditionally  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:17):**  been about has been about producing food for families and for townships.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:21):**  And I really felt that we could showcase that in Elfin and show people how much food a crofting  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:26):**  township can produce.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:28):**  Helen believes that by working together as a township, new possibilities have been unlocked,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:34):**  possibilities that individual small holdings or small farms simply don't have.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:39):**  One of the biggest things about working together, particularly for the smaller producers, it's  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:45):**  not viable for them.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:46):**  So someone growing vegetables in their backyard, it's not viable for them to set up a website,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:52):**  do deliveries once a week and do all the marketing that goes with that.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:55):**  I mean, that was one of the original reasons of trying to start this collective thing was  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:18:59):**  just that instead of us all competing and all telling the same story, we could do it  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:03):**  all together.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:04):**  But one of the biggest things is just the economy of scale and that you can't run something  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:09):**  like this economically or effectively at a smaller scale.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:13):**  But it also hopefully means that in the future, particularly, we can share information, we  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:19):**  can share resources.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:20):**  My neighbor is getting a tractor, I don't have to get my own tractor.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:25):**  My friend's got a chiller unit, we can use that for the meat.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:27):**  The guy with the amazing vegetables gives us seeds every year because he's got extra  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:33):**  seeds.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:34):**  The whole idea about working together on our own, we're all too small.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:38):**  Everything's too expensive.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:39):**  There's no bulk discount orders.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:42):**  You can't justify delivering things or going to pick things up.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:45):**  Whereas together, there's less work, we're combining the workload and then we can share  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:50):**  things.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:52):**  Finding new ways to deliver healthy, nutritious food in affordable and convenient ways to  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:19:57):**  a lot more people is going to be a lot of work.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:01):**  Most farmers are already working as hard as they can.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:04):**  And we can't expect every farmer individually to be able to produce great food, market that  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:10):**  food, deliver and sell that food in ways that are viable and can affect a meaningful system  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:16):**  change.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:17):**  If we instead think of the township as the unit, like what's happening in Eltham, all  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:22):**  of a sudden we may be able to start to unlock all sorts of economies of scale and spread  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:27):**  the workload.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:28):**  And this isn't just the growing, this is the distribution, the packaging, the cooling,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:35):**  all this sort of stuff.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:37):**  If you then expand this out beyond just the single township and think about it at the  
**[0:20:42-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:42):**  landscape, the bio-regional or territory level, it gets even more exciting.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:20:55):**  Imagine you have a number of townships working together, delivering nutritious meals to all  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:00):**  sorts of people.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:03):**  All of a sudden you start to unlock even greater economies of scale and potentially then there  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:09):**  could be a way to do all these things, to do the seemingly impossible.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:14):**  There might be a way to deliver good food in affordable, accessible and convenient ways  
**[0:21:18-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:18):**  to everyone.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:37):**  Crofting isn't the only form of collective land management found in Scotland today.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:42):**  Over the past couple decades, several pretty innovative land reform acts have been passed  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:47):**  by the Scottish government.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:48):**  They give whole communities, rather than just individuals, the mechanisms to organise themselves  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:53):**  and to buy land.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:21:55):**  Now all across Scotland, not just in the Highlands, we're beginning to see communities creating  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:00):**  new models of owning and managing land and challenging our ideas about what's normal  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:06):**  and what's possible.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:07):**  The Isle of Egg, whose celebrations my dad is always a part of, is just one example.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:13):**  Whilst this approach has mostly so far been taken in the crofting communities of the Highlands  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:17):**  and Islands, more and more we're starting to see this idea of community ownership of  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:22):**  land spreading across Scotland and even becoming normalised as an idea right across the country.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:28):**  At this point, roughly 560,000 acres of land are owned and managed by communities, with  
**[0:22:34-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:34):**  around 25,000 folk living in these areas.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:44):**  Adam Callow is a postdoctoral researcher at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:50):**  Originally from the US, Adam has been drawn to Scotland precisely because of the potential  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:54):**  he sees in land reforms here.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:22:58):**  I've been most excited about the way Scotland attempts to be shifting the narrative about  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:03):**  what land is and how it's used, in particular that land ownership and land use are connected.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:10):**  The phenomenon of land ownership has deep implications for what things are done on the  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:16):**  land and who benefits and who wins and who loses.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:19):**  Over the last many decades of the World Bank, the main policy was to formalise land relationships,  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:26):**  to give people property rights where there were none before, so that now they're in control  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:31):**  of their own destiny, they will behave as economic rational actors.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:36):**  It's completely profound and radical to say the opposite.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:40):**  I think that opens up a lot of possibilities to think about if we want some societal outcome  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:46):**  that is easy to express, health, good food, life expectancy, economic opportunities, that's  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:54):**  connected to the way we engage with the resource base.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:23:59):**  Usually those things are just totally separated.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:02):**  You have maybe one of the only places in the so-called global north that has the land policy  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:06):**  to maybe shake things up at a structural level.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:09):**  Scotland as a nation has the highest concentration of land ownership anywhere in Western Europe.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:15):**  In fact, it's thought that fewer than 500 individuals own over 50% of the land here,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:22):**  and a mere 16 people own 10%.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:27):**  These land reform acts have been brought in to try to dilute this in some way.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:31):**  But while community buyouts are starting to happen across Scotland, they tend to be focused  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:35):**  on housing, energy projects and woodlands.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:39):**  What we haven't seen yet in Scotland are these acts being used explicitly to enable communities  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:45):**  to purchase agricultural land explicitly for agricultural purposes, to grow food and to  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:51):**  create opportunities for new entrant farmers.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:24:54):**  I would love to see creative use of these land reform tools to shake up profoundly the  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:00):**  agricultural sector, the food production sector.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:03):**  I think by design, some of the community buyout legislation, the land reform acts tended to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:08):**  separate agriculture from land in general.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:12):**  But it doesn't make sense to separate land use from land and land ownership.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:18):**  They're intertwined.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:20):**  The acts say if you're using land, owning land in a way that tends to harm the public  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:24):**  good, then you might be subject to these kinds of compulsory buyouts.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:28):**  I see it exactly the same if a large estate owner is not pursuing land use that benefits  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:35):**  their very own tenants, not to say much of the neighbors.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:38):**  That's the same as an agricultural owner who is overusing pesticides or who is selling  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:45):**  only for export when there's a nearby demand for local food.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:49):**  So the very same logics of why land should be transferred to communities in the land  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:54):**  reform acts applies in some cases to this agricultural context.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:25:58):**  So what if we combine the existing tried and tested Highland model, Crofting, with this  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:03):**  new movement of community ownership of land we've heard about and applied it to prime  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:08):**  agricultural land outside of the poor quality ground of today's crofting areas?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:14):**  What if areas of good fertile farmland adopted the key crofting principles, secure tenancy  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:20):**  arrangements for tenant farmers, access to areas of common land, and with whole townships  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:25):**  working together?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:26):**  And what if we then use the principles of agroecology to manage this land?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:30):**  And what's more, we now have legislation in place where the community itself can be  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:35):**  the landowner.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:37):**  These ideas are not only possible in law, but they have proven to have worked and are  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:41):**  working well.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:43):**  It seems to me that in Scotland we potentially already have really compelling tools and tenure  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:49):**  systems that could enable us to recreate and reimagine the pre-colonial landscape and to  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:26:55):**  tackle the really big issues of today.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:00):**  As existing farmers begin to retire or throw in the towel, could this be a way of taking  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:05):**  advantage of the upcoming flood of agricultural land onto the market?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:11):**  When large, medium and small farms across Scotland begin to come up for sale, can we  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:16):**  think about them as potential new crofting townships?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:19):**  Could we see new tenanted crofts being created on good farmland, in areas where this practice  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:25):**  was stamped out centuries ago, but rather than having a clan chief or an individual  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:30):**  owner at the top, it's the community that own it?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:35):**  And critically, could this also be a way to create opportunities and make land accessible  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:40):**  to new entrants, to ensure that everyone who wants to work on the land has the opportunity  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:44):**  to do so?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:51):**  At the moment, the legislation tends to be set up to enable communities already living  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:55):**  locally to use the legislation.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:27:57):**  Whilst there are good reasons for this, it can also exclude others who are not already  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:02):**  in rural locations to be part of the conversation and to make the most of this new legislation.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:09):**  I wonder if we could expand this model to other communities of interest, such as communities  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:14):**  of colour, and make this a truly inclusive, reparative approach.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:19):**  I asked Dr Callum MacLeod, the policy director for Community Land Scotland, what he thought.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:25):**  There's definitely a conversation to be had between communities of interest and communities  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:29):**  of place as well, in terms of how we actually encourage more diverse land ownership, and  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:35):**  particularly as well, what we're doing with the land.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:37):**  It's very important that debates and dialogue around land itself should not be the preserve  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:43):**  of an exclusive elite or indeed people of particular backgrounds.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:49):**  I think it's really vitally important that we do have an inclusive, equitable approach  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:28:55):**  to having conversations about land, who owns it, how they use it, and critically, who benefits  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:01):**  from ownership and use of land as well.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:04):**  You can connect that absolutely to issues about social inclusion, issues of gender,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:10):**  ethnicity, and all these different dimensions, so that we do get equality across the board  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:16):**  in terms of ensuring that all people in the community are benefiting from initiatives  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:21):**  that are taking place.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:22):**  We've seen lots of examples where there are really progressive, socially inclusive initiatives  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:29):**  that are actually being undertaken by community landowners in that space.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:33):**  There needs to be a lot more of that, and I think it provides a model where you can  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:36):**  start to think about that.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:38):**  Using agroecology at scale will require a lot more people, a lot more skills and knowledge  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:44):**  that needs to be brought back to the land.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:46):**  If we're talking about repeopling the landscape, then there is space for everyone.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:52):**  Communities of place, by which I mean the people already in these rural communities,  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:29:56):**  need to be connecting with communities and individuals from elsewhere and engaging in  
**[0:30:02-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:02):**  these conversations to help make these places inviting, welcoming, and open.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:13):**  In amongst all these discussions and big ideas, there's a big elephant in the room.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:18):**  We're talking about potentially huge transfers of land and movements of people into rural  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:24):**  places, creating enterprise in an industry known for its tiny margins, low pay, and precarious  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:30):**  profits.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:33):**  Where on earth is the money going to come from to fund any of these ideas?  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:36):**  The food discourse is often separated from the land discourse.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:40):**  When we combine those two things, I think that's where the broader structural solutions  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:44):**  come out.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:45):**  I think the financing innovation that I see as promising is really around the value chain  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:51):**  side of it.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:52):**  I think there is room for reorienting how much society pays in terms of the various  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:30:56):**  elements along the food chain and for how it values food.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:01):**  There's got to be a middle ground between Tesco and the CSAs.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:05):**  In July 2021, the National Food Strategy for England was published, an independent review  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:11):**  commissioned by the UK government.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:13):**  This national food strategy included a raft of recommendations, including that fruit and  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:18):**  vegetables be prescribed on the NHS and extending free school meals to millions more children.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:24):**  These policies could reorientate public money in a way that could potentially really strengthen  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:29):**  agroecological supply chains, all while addressing the real challenges of food inequality and  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:35):**  diet related health concerns.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:37):**  Imagine the avoided public health care bill that could potentially be diverted into the  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:41):**  production of nutritious agroecological food, growing the market for environmentally positive  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:47):**  produce that is not priced out of reach for those who would benefit from it the most.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:53):**  While the National Food Strategy recommendations focus only on England, here in Scotland, a  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:31:59):**  piece of legislation known as the Good Food Nation Bill is soon to be debated in Parliament,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:04):**  which if passed, would enshrine a right to food into law.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:08):**  So if parents of school children are demanding, rightly so, more nutritious lunches, that's  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:15):**  an entitlement, this right to food, but then it's done through an import plan, it would  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:20):**  be much harder but much more exciting and transformative if there were goals of meeting  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:26):**  those procurements from the peri-urban systems, right?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:30):**  You actually have a municipality working together to mobilise public resources, but then also  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:35):**  provides a market of solidarity.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:38):**  That's new farm agroecological labour just waiting to happen, waiting to fill that gap.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:42):**  All over the UK, there are serious moves that suggest public money should be used to tackle  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:47):**  food inequity.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:48):**  That could be through procurement or other market growing mechanisms, but there are also  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:53):**  huge changes coming in agricultural subsidies shifting to incentivise environmental land  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:32:59):**  management.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:00):**  Another huge portion of the public purse, which is currently being looked at for the  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:04):**  first time in decades.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:06):**  Almost £600 million of public money is being spent in Scotland already in these subsidies.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:12):**  For decades, much of this was being received simply for owning land.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:16):**  By matching some of the land policies with the food policies and rethinking the best  
**[0:33:21-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:21):**  use of this money, big changes could be possible.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:32):**  Now let's imagine just for a second that all the prime agricultural land in Scotland  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:37):**  were to be bought by communities.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:39):**  That's about 46% of Scotland.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:42):**  If we take all of this good fertile farmland together, I reckon the total value is somewhere  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:48):**  in the region of £34 billion.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:53):**  Now even if it's only a small percentage of this land that comes onto the market, there  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:33:58):**  are going to have to be serious innovations of how we go about financing this.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:03):**  Currently the primary funding for community land acquisitions comes from the Scottish  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:08):**  Land Fund.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:09):**  Which at the moment annually has a budget of £10 million per annum.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:13):**  Now that's a really welcome policy lever as it were.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:16):**  But you're absolutely right, that in itself is not enough in terms of time to address  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:22):**  this overall.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:23):**  And so if we're going to talk about a just transition, we do need to think about the  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:27):**  financing dimensions of that.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:28):**  And particularly how we get communities involved in that process in ways that are going to  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:33):**  benefit them as well.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:34):**  Some of that I think is around broadening out the range of investments so that you get  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:39):**  a mix of public, private and other dimensions to that.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:43):**  I think Whit mentioned things like crowdfunding, that's one dimension of it.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:47):**  I think there's an important part to be played by other NGOs.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:51):**  I think there's a whole range of things that you could frame within a, not least a kind  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:34:56):**  of corporate social responsibility frame that actually would meet those quite sound investments  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:03):**  in some respects.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:04):**  While ensuring that communities actually are able to control and have the significance  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:10):**  in terms of what happens to the land in their communities.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:15):**  How to fund these changes isn't something that's going to have a quick, straightforward  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:23):**  answer.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:24):**  But there may also be another option.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:27):**  According to La Via Campesina, an international movement representing over 200 million small  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:33):**  and medium scale producers, agricultural workers and indigenous communities from around the  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:38):**  world, an agrarian reform cannot be carried out through market mechanisms.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:44):**  In every instance where there's agricultural land that has the ability to foster kind of  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:48):**  deep human environment interactions and sense of place, the disconnection between that land  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:54):**  as a commodity needs to happen and needs to happen as quickly as possible.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:35:58):**  So in what ways can they gain access to the land now that that first step always involves  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:03):**  and that's the way the Scottish acts are written is through compensation, right?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:07):**  So you're always paying out the original owner, but then afterwards, can we rewrite the rules  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:13):**  about how that land is treated as an asset and in particular one that's not financialized  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:19):**  and not treated as a liquid commodity?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:21):**  Because it's not, you know, land is not like a map.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:23):**  You cannot roll it up and take it away.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:36):**  I've come to believe that most farmers have a connection to their farms and the land,  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:40):**  which goes much deeper than just it being a financial asset or something that they own.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:46):**  The land is what farmers have put their lives into.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:49):**  And if they're able to, most farmers want to do what they think is best for the land.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:36:55):**  In this, I think there could be the kernel of something profoundly transformative.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:01):**  What if farmers without a succession plan had an alternative to selling up and putting  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:06):**  their farm on the open market?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:09):**  If they knew they'd be supported in their retirement and that the land that they'd put  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:13):**  their lives work into could continue to be tended and cared for.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:19):**  What if farmers could gift their lands to communities?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:25):**  This seemingly radical suggestion actually could have some pretty mainstream precedents.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:31):**  Leaving property to the National Trust, for instance, who happen to be one of the UK's  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:36):**  largest landowners with nearly 250,000 hectares of farmland.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:41):**  Isn't that unusual a thing to do?  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:43):**  Much of their land has been gifted to them in a similar way to what I'm suggesting.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:49):**  Is it so radical to imagine that this could be possible at a regional or local level to  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:37:54):**  transfer land into community-owned farms, townships and territories?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:00):**  There are already models that exist elsewhere in Europe which have demonstrated that when  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:05):**  an existing farmer leaves their farm, this kind of process means both they and their  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:10):**  land will be well looked after.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:13):**  This idea doesn't have to be a terrifying one.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:21):**  But of course for this to be an option, there needs to be a community to gift the land to.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:26):**  Community groups who see this as an opportunity would need to start organising themselves,  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:31):**  connecting with one another and with farmers and landowners.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:35):**  After all, in order for existing farmers to see this as a serious possibility, communities  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:41):**  and aspiring farmers also need to take it seriously.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:45):**  As with almost everything I've been finding, it comes down to making connections, identifying  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:51):**  commonalities, finding common cause and working together to imagine something better.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:38:56):**  I believe there's a chance that these ideas can not just be feasible, but really desirable,  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:03):**  but will only start to make them happen if we find new ways to work together.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:08):**  It comes down to people and it comes back to the overwhelming conclusion of we can achieve  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:14):**  a lot of these solutions with greater collaboration, whether that's within landscapes or between  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:20):**  farms or within food chains or within sectors.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:23):**  There's a lot that can be gained and resolved in terms of these overarching international  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:29):**  crises if we get more people working together.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:32):**  That's Will Fraser from the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:36):**  So it's all of this kind of connective tissue, which I think we could really start making  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:41):**  some really rapid progress on some of our national goals.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:46):**  If our end goal with all of this is to move entire landscapes into agroecological models  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:50):**  of farming practice, which are highly productive whilst leaving space for habitat and biodiversity,  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:39:56):**  whilst delivering healthy, nutritious, good food, conveniently, affordably, accessibly  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:01):**  to everyone, and at the same time, get a lot of people onto the ground, onto the land in  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:08):**  dignified, meaningful and well-paid work.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:11):**  This is going to take a deep transformation that is way beyond the scale of the small  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:16):**  family farm.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:17):**  Do we need to be addressing these issues more at a landscape scale?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:21):**  I think, yeah, increasingly we're arriving at the answer that absolutely yes, but the  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:27):**  route to that answer is through our people and our communities and having a more grassroot  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:33):**  sort of bottom-up approach perhaps.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:35):**  But I should also make it really clear that existing family farms are absolutely part  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:40):**  of this.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:41):**  Family farms have a huge role to play here.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:44):**  This isn't about pointing fingers at family farms or small farmers, but there's a need  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:49):**  to recognise that in order to be part of a change towards a just agroecological future,  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:40:55):**  we need to see ourselves as part of something bigger than just our farms and to begin to  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:00):**  work together with other family farms and potentially these new types of crofting townships.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:05):**  Once you get into that mindset and that way of thinking, you suddenly think, well, for  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:08):**  this to genuinely work across my business, whatever size, it needs to be working within  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:12):**  my whole local landscape.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:14):**  So I need to be having a discussion with all of my mates and neighbours next door about  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:18):**  how do we do this?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:20):**  And we can only really do this really well together rather than apart because ultimately,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:24):**  if I'm just an island as a business surrounded by other people that are doing things going  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:28):**  in the opposite direction, then it's a sort of hiding for nothing.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:33):**  The exciting thing is the beginning of this change is starting to happen.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:39):**  Earlier this year, a series of events right here in the Highlands was held under the banner  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:44):**  of the Highland Good Food Conversation.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:47):**  Over the course of five weeks, more than 90 farmers, crofters, food business owners, NHS  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:53):**  nutritionists, school teachers, enthusiasts and eaters came together online to try to  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:41:58):**  imagine what actions we all would need to take in order to make healthy local food the  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:03):**  norm for everyone in the Highlands.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:06):**  For Emma Whitton, one of the organisers of the conference, one of the biggest takeaways  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:10):**  was people's eagerness to link up and to begin to find new ways of working together.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:15):**  I feel there's this real shift that people realise it's no longer about individual businesses  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:20):**  or individual people, it's actually the power that we've got by being connected.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:25):**  I think throughout the conference it sort of grew, that sense of interconnectedness  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:29):**  that exists between us all.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:31):**  The food system is so, for me it blows my mind, it's so infinite, it's connected to  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:35):**  absolutely every single part of our life.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:38):**  I just felt that thread just coming through that conference of people realising that every  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:43):**  single one of us is part of a huge system and it's only going to work if we all work  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:48):**  together.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:42:49):**  I've spent much of the last year delving into the past, present and future of the family  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:05):**  farm.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:06):**  I've learnt a huge amount and it's confronted and excited me in ways that I never imagined.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:13):**  From where I am now, looking forward, what could all this mean for me and for my family's  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:18):**  farm right here at Inchendow?  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:24):**  In all honesty, I don't know.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:27):**  I kind of feel that I've unearthed more questions than answers along the way.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:33):**  But what I do know is that we need to start to have a lot more conversations about these  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:40):**  things.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:41):**  About farm succession, about our connection to the landscape and the legacies of its past  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:48):**  and our hopes for its future.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:53):**  Whilst our family farm here at Inchendow doesn't have an imminent crisis of succession, that  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:43:59):**  doesn't need to stop more people, different people, people I'm not related to, becoming  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:04):**  engaged with the land here.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:08):**  We're going to have to have a lot of new conversations.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:12):**  Things that may be unfamiliar and potentially uncomfortable, but they are necessary.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:20):**  Throughout this series, I've chosen to look at these topics from the perspective of the  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:24):**  Scottish Highlands for no other reason than this is where I'm from and where I plan to  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:29):**  spend my life.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:31):**  If I happen to be from somewhere else, I'd look at things from the perspective of that  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:37):**  place.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:38):**  In fact, wherever you are, I'd encourage you to start asking the kinds of questions  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:43):**  I've been asking over the course of this series.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:46):**  To start digging where you stand, to understand the hidden histories of your place and the  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:52):**  clues it could hold for your future.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:44:55):**  When talking about history and particularly the uncomfortable parts of our colonial history,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:01):**  some people have said to me, this stuff happened hundreds of years ago.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:05):**  It's in the past.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:06):**  Let's just draw a line under it and move on.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:09):**  To which I say, move on to where?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:13):**  Figuring that question out requires us first to look back and then to look around us.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:20):**  Time may be running out for the small family farm and we need to start thinking about what  
**[0:45:24-0:45:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:24):**  we want our landscapes to look like to provide and to be in the future before it's too late.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:32):**  I may not have landed on any perfect answers, but what I hope more than anything is that  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:37):**  this series is a starting point, a launch pad for these conversations rather than a  
**[0:45:42-0:45:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:42):**  conclusion or any kind of end point.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:50):**  So to farmers and landowners out there, you have so much power to effect change in so  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:56):**  many ways.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:45:57):**  You are the custodians of the land and you have the ability to bring about great possibilities  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:02):**  for positive change.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:05):**  Please be open to these conversations.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:08):**  If you are somebody who wants to farm, this doesn't need to be an impossible dream.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:13):**  Find your community, organise and speak up so that farmers and policy makers can hear  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:19):**  that there is a demand for an alternative trajectory.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:23):**  If you are in Scotland, speak to Community Land Scotland who have tons of resources on  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:27):**  community buyouts.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:29):**  If you are a black aspiring farmer or person of colour, look up Land in Our Names who are  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:34):**  already organising in this space.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:38):**  Most of all, to everyone, start talking to each other, connect with your neighbours and  
**[0:46:45-0:47:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/landed-part-4-places-of-possibilities#t=0:46:45):**  collaborate with communities to reimagine, together, what your landscapes could become.

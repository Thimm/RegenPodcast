**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:00):**  She had a dream once where she realized that her experience and her consciousness and her  
**[0:00:15-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:15):**  desire was just the sum total of all of her cells and bacteria, her organs and parts,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:26):**  all held together in her skin, ornamented with painted nails and long brushed hair,  
**[0:00:35-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:35):**  and sometimes salted with beads of sweat and mucosal trickles, inlaid with eyes that were  
**[0:00:46-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:46):**  often looked into or away from. All of these parts were willing themselves into a hole,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:57):**  working together just to stay alive and within that necessitating the illusion of her.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:06):**  Cultivating Justice eliminate justice. Cultivating Justice Episode 6  
**[0:01:36-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:36):**  Before we get into the episode, a heads up that includes discussions of trauma, racism  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:46):**  and colonialism. Please take care as you listen.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:49):**  Three, two, one. Welcome to Culting Justice.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:55):**  I'm Hester Russell. I'm a grower and an organiser for Out on the Land.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:59):**  I'm Sam Siva. I'm a grower, writer and organiser with Land in Our Names.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:05):**  And I'm Katie Revel. I'm part of the Farmerama team and I produced this series, so I've been  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:10):**  helping to pull everything together.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:13):**  The clip we just heard is taken from a performance by artists in Wai Kin. It mixes their sounds  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:18):**  and poetry with music from the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto and recordings from Oceans  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:24):**  and Compost Piles.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:26):**  In this episode, we'll hear from a therapist about healing the trauma of being separated  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:30):**  from the land.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:31):**  We'll learn about the surprising findings of a study into the experiences of black farmers.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:37):**  And Sam, you're going to close the series with your vision of what the land and food  
**[0:02:41-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:41):**  justice movement could look like if it centred queer frameworks, anti-racism and reparations.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:51):**  Shrikant Narayanan is a Glasgow-based psychotherapist. The interview we're about to hear was actually  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:57):**  recorded by Col Gordon for Farmerama's Landed series, which explored colonial legacy, land  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:03):**  reform, reparations, food justice, traditional Gaelic land relations and lots and lots of  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:10):**  other things as well.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:12):**  That interview covered a lot of ground and it really stuck with me. As is often the case,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:18):**  a lot of it didn't make it into the final series and so I'm really glad that we can  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:22):**  share some more of it here.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:25):**  The bit we're about to hear, I think, really chimes with a lot of the themes of the Cultivating  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:29):**  Justice Project. So thank you to Shrikant and to Col for letting us include it. So as  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:35):**  I said, Shrikant is a psychotherapist.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:38):**  One of my particular interests is eco-psychology. That's really about all the relationships  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:45):**  that we have as an ecosystem, relationships between humans and relationships between humans  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:54):**  and the other than human, which includes the land in general. And another part of the work  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:00):**  that I do is that I'm a grower, I guess an aspiring farmer, and seeking my own relationship  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:08):**  with the land and with food in a way that maybe brings all of these interests together.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:16):**  I guess one of the questions that I have is, like, is there a psychology of our relationships  
**[0:04:22-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:22):**  to the land and to plants and to forests and to the ocean? Where did those relationships  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:31):**  come from? Are there any other ways that this relationship could be? It's almost like coming  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:38):**  from the other direction when we really experience a connection with the land. We can experience  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:44):**  it in a way where we know that although it's different from us, there really is a kind  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:50):**  of bond there, that in some ways nature is not something that's outside of us. And I  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:57):**  guess that many of us who work on the land have experienced that at some point. It's  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:02):**  also something that's really easy to slip away from. It's not the common currency of  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:08):**  our culture in the West. It's not the way that the sort of systems that coordinate and  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:14):**  control our lives, economic systems, work. So there's a kind of mismatch there. And there's  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:21):**  a kind of questioning that you can get into about where did that separation, that mismatch  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:26):**  come from? How far back does it go? And part of it is that people have been across the  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:34):**  world, but especially in places that were colonised, they've been removed from their  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:40):**  land or their land has been occupied. That individuals have also been moved from the  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:46):**  land because of perhaps economic forces. And also when did we start looking at the land  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:51):**  as something that is just there for us to take from? That's a question that maybe the  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:56):**  answers really go back to when we started needing agriculture. We needed to organise  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:01):**  ways to have the land provide for us. And so if we really want to answer those questions  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:08):**  or redefine our relationships, we need to find those places in ourselves where those  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:15):**  wounds still exist. The pain of losing that connection. And I guess that's part of the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:22):**  work that I'm interested in is where are the places in ourselves where we hide from that  
**[0:06:28-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:28):**  wound, where we can't acknowledge that, because we need that back if we're to reconnect.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:41):**  The most straightforward way of talking about it is about trauma. That there's a traumatic  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:48):**  loss that's taken place. That there was a connection there that isn't there anymore.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:54):**  So a lot of the process is about working with trauma. It's about finding those places in  
**[0:07:00-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:00):**  ourselves that we've alienated, which we've kind of decided maybe because of forces outside  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:09):**  of us are other or need to be controlled or need to be shackled in some way or productive  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:18):**  way. And kind of giving them back some agency, taking the chains off. And that often releases  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:25):**  a lot of pain. Looking at it through the lens of trauma is quite useful because it's quite  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:31):**  a well recognised thing now that trauma can be passed down from generation to generation.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:37):**  That those wounds that we have are not just our own and we may be holding things that  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:44):**  have been there for generations. So we're not just healing them for ourselves. We're  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:49):**  healing them because something is calling us from potentially many generations ago.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:54):**  And that's part of the way that we've lost touch with these things is because in the  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:59):**  West, certainly there's been a real focus on individual pursuit, individual psychology.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:05):**  You do your work, become a better person and then life is fine. And when we look more collectively,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:13):**  we see that we're all holding things for each other and for generations that have preceded  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:22):**  us. So I guess the responsibility there is to like, well, if we start to look at those  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:28):**  things and work with those things, then we don't need to pass them on as wounds. These  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:33):**  are things that call us and it's up to us to answer the call. Many, many of us know  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:39):**  that it's there, but it's easy to ignore it and just get on with the lives that have  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:44):**  been laid out for us. I guess when we're talking about how we might have colonised peoples  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:50):**  and lands, we're talking about the way that the powerful have come to dominate the less  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:57):**  powerful. And in some ways, this is something that all of us as humans in relationship to  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:02):**  the land and to the other than human have to wrestle with, which is how are we coming  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:09):**  to dominate those other things with which we're working or being alongside or living  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:16):**  with? Because that's a very particular kind of relationship, the relationship that I need  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:21):**  to control you. I need you to produce for me. I need you to appear when I say you need  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:29):**  to appear and go away when I say you need to go away. It's a very particular kind of  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:36):**  relationship which nowadays we really, really question when it comes to human relationships,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:41):**  but maybe less so when it comes to relationships with the land. One of the things that I'm  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:46):**  really interested in is how can we question that kind of need to control, that kind of  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:52):**  need to impose our power on the land, on the other than human? Which is not to say that  
**[0:09:59-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:59):**  we stop needing things or receiving from the land. It's just to say that we do so in a  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:07):**  relationship that is more mutual, maybe more respectful, that respects the processes that  
**[0:10:14-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:14):**  are going on that are not ours. Part of that loss of that kind of relationship, of mutuality,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:32):**  a reciprocal relationship, is guilt about the need to control, guilt about the ways  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:38):**  in which we might need to exploit the other, which needs to be processed. And these are  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:45):**  huge things. They're in the coloniser, in the person who's doing the controlling. And  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:53):**  we can go through life very practically and not really question them, partly because that  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:58):**  is supported by the culture that we're in predominantly. So it takes a really big step  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:04):**  to kind of stop and kind of go, ah, no, but actually there's a part of me that feels this  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:10):**  guilt. There's a part of me that feels that pain and that doesn't want to have that relationship.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:18):**  That can be quite subtle work and it can be quite painful work and it requires some grieving  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:25):**  of what was lost. But that's part of a healing process. Just by acknowledging those parts  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:31):**  of ourselves, we start to see the pain and let it breathe. And that's the way we find  
**[0:11:38-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:38):**  our way back. There's nothing wrong with intellectualising it. In fact, that can be a really great way  
**[0:11:51-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:51):**  in the intellectual debate about decolonisation, domestication, undomestication, finding connection  
**[0:12:01-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:01):**  is valuable, but it's not where the experience lies. The experience and the trauma and the  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:09):**  wounds are in our bodies, in our souls. And if we really want that connection, we have  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:15):**  to engage with it in the ways that our bodies engage with it. It's looking at ourselves  
**[0:12:21-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:21):**  as nature, as living organisms, as creatures with a soul. And part of the way we might  
**[0:12:31-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:31):**  start to do that is through our bodies, through how we relate physically to the land. So for  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:40):**  me, some of those things in more practical terms are about movement, are about sound,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:47):**  are about dance, about ritual, about ceremony. Those things are really important when we're  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:55):**  trying to engage ourselves more deeply in a relationship. They speak to us at a level  
**[0:13:01-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:01):**  which the words and the ideas maybe can't get at.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:24):**  What are your takeaways from Srikanth's piece?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:27):**  One thing I find really interesting is the role that language plays in shaping our understanding  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:33):**  of reality, shaping the way that we actually see the world and the fact that it can also  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:38):**  really restrict that understanding. One of the reasons language matters is that if we  
**[0:13:44-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:44):**  are able to find new ways or maybe rediscover old ways of talking about the other than human  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:52):**  or the more than human world and getting away from terms that are common at the moment,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:58):**  like nature or the environment, maybe that can help us get away from this false dichotomy  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:05):**  that Srikanth was talking about between humans and the rest of the world. It takes a conscious  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:12):**  effort because we're so habituated to these ways of talking and therefore these ways of  
**[0:14:17-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:17):**  thinking that do entrench that divide. Even if in our hearts we understand that there  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:27):**  is no divide, the language that we have to hand forces us to perpetuate that divide.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:33):**  I would totally agree with that. I think this language of human exceptionalism and separation  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:41):**  from the ecosystems that we work and exploit has really been the vehicle for a lot of the  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:48):**  violence that we've perpetrated on the planet and on living things and on each other. I  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:55):**  think like you say, it is a conscious effort to reconfigure that language, but I do think  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:01):**  that that's a really important part of knitting ourselves back into the natural world. I don't  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:08):**  know, it can feel quite weird trying to adopt these new, I want to say made up terms, but  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:15):**  obviously all language is made up. But when you're trying to import a engineered concept,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:20):**  I think it can feel quite inauthentic. But I think you just have to push through that  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:25):**  moment, don't you? Because that is the real way that we can reimagine.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:32):**  Another thing for me that Srikanth touches on at the end is not intellectualising and  
**[0:15:37-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:37):**  the embodiment of this healing and being embodied on the land. That really resonated with me.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:47):**  I thought quite a lot about how important ritual is and how impoverished I feel in terms  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:54):**  of ritual. I think particularly in perhaps like white British culture or something, we  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:01):**  don't have much ritual and we've kind of come away from it. Sometimes there's a bit of discomfort  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:09):**  or an embarrassment in trying to recreate that, which I've definitely felt. But I feel,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:16):**  yeah, it's really important to me to try and find an authentic voice in ritual and celebration  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:22):**  and reconnecting in that sort of embodied and collective way.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:27):**  I definitely haven't found a route through that for myself and I absolutely get that  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:33):**  kind of squeamishness. Trying to participate in ritual or in ceremony without feeling like  
**[0:16:41-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:41):**  it has to be cloaked in sort of irony or self-consciousness or sarcasm is a real challenge, but I think  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:49):**  is really important.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:50):**  Yeah, and those are sort of deflection mechanisms, aren't they? But yeah, and I think that feeling  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:58):**  that it's going to be appropriative or extractive from other cultures is a product of us not  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:05):**  dealing with our colonial history and our ongoing profiting.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:11):**  And also there is a culture within hippie and the countercultural movement in the sixties  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:18):**  and seventies where it was literally appropriation and that's still very present here. But I  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:23):**  think there are ways to have ritual and so much of what Srikanth is talking about is  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:30):**  how just connecting to the land, just being within that relationship with the land is  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:37):**  actually like this is something that belongs to everyone. It's not bound by a specific  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:43):**  culture or whatever. This is just something that through industrialization, through colonialism  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:49):**  and being, I guess, for British folks as well or Northern European people in the recent  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:55):**  history being beneficiaries or complicit in colonialism, how that further separates you  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:02):**  from each other and from the land.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:05):**  And yeah, I think actually having that relationship with the land is a way of healing that and  
**[0:18:12-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:12):**  creating new ways of communing and building communities and so on.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:20):**  Cultivating justice.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:25):**  The song you're about to hear is called The Lark in the Morning by Egg Club 7. It's a  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:30):**  reworking of a trad folk tune and the lyrics were inspired by the focus on women's liberation  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:35):**  in the Kurdish freedom movement. Although the lyrics come across as quite black and  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:39):**  white in terms of gender division, the broad aim was to remember patriarchy as a system  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:44):**  rather than a gender. You can find the song on the LWA Stand Up Now album.  
**[0:18:49-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:49):**  And the Lark in the morning she rises up fast and she goes up in the air with a jewel of  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:05):**  stars and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes home in the  
**[0:19:11-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:11):**  evening by the land that keeps the wind.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:31):**  The ash tree, the ash in the valley down the hill, it could be a hundred and a fifty years  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:37):**  through storm and gale and still. Strangled by the ivy and dye ballooning on the weather  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:43):**  but not here there's all the growth the sap will rise alone. The ivy'll deceive you by  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:49):**  its stranded tendencies as it goes up and scaling all the branches on the trees. And  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:56):**  while it's young and nimble the dawn of truth is numbling as it goes thick and heavy and  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:01):**  bears the wits of old age and the young.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:04):**  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:11):**  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:20:17-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:17):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:37):**  For years by the hundred of life under these mounds these batches have a home to feed and  
**[0:20:43-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:43):**  sleep under the ground. And men with mega projects they tell turn around saying go back into  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:51):**  your home okay you will bury you down. The teeth and clothes of badgers are no match  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:57):**  for the state but every tooth and every claw of every animal chases. The wind brings the  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:03):**  story of blood from off the weep to the ecology of all life under the men that stamp their  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:10):**  feet.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:11):**  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:18):**  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:21:23-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:23):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:52):**  A man is not like I, he owes his status quo, you'll hear it in the folk song and the story  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:06):**  days of old. He owns a savage hunt and tends his family from above along with the Lark in  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:13):**  the morning as a symbol for love. So anytime that a woman gets an order from a man or language  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:21):**  dropping up the dominant story all is planned. We have to fight it for our lives with all  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:26):**  the wisdom and the oath. Cause nothing lives in freedom in a world that's ruled by ghosts.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:33):**  Cause nothing lives in freedom in a world that's ruled by ghosts.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:37):**  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:44):**  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:49):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:23:19):**  Now we're going to listen to a chat between executive producers Abby and Dora on the show.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:23:49):**  Dora did some research into the experience of black farmers and what she found challenged  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:23:55):**  her assumptions about why and how black people farm.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:23:59):**  The title is race exclusion and enterprise exploring the place of black farmers in the  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:05):**  UK's alternative farming movement. I was studying a MA in food anthropology and I'd  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:13):**  been becoming really interested in the kind of alternative food and farming movement as  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:21):**  an answer to climate change. And then kind of outside of my studies I'd also been engaging  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:28):**  more with my black community and kind of learning more about anti-racism and getting more into  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:35):**  activism. And I kind of began to realize that those two things were linked. So I decided  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:43):**  to talk to some black farmers and growers to kind of see whether those like anti-racist  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:51):**  narratives were kind of coming into their growing. If you'd like to share some of your  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:58):**  key findings from those explorations that'd be great. When I set out on the dissertation  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:04):**  like I had to have a kind of research question that I was attempting to answer and my question  
**[0:25:10-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:10):**  was how are black British farmers and growers linking anti-racism with their farming practices.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:21):**  And I was working with farmers and growers who are growing in non-intensive ways so whatever  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:27):**  you want to call that but broadly agroecological methods. And because of the kind of literature  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:34):**  that I've been reading which that isn't that much of but what is there and the kind of  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:38):**  spokespeople within this space I was expecting all of these growers to have a very clear  
**[0:25:44-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:44):**  rhetorical link between we grow in this non-extractive regenerative way because it reflects broader  
**[0:25:54-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:54):**  arguments around decolonization around anti-racism around land justice. And actually when I spoke  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:03):**  to people although that was definitely there it was never their primary motivation and  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:10):**  instead that link was very much implicit. When I asked whether that link was there a  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:17):**  lot of the growers were almost kind of confused that I was asking it was self-evident to them  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:22):**  that of course it is that's what we do. And I think with that there was also this reluctance  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:29):**  to use the language I guess of the regenerative farming movement. I asked people growing in  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:37):**  an organic or an agroecological way their reasons behind it and a lot of growers were  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:43):**  very wary of using those terms. One woman said to me organic just means it's from the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:50):**  earth sustainable just means we're able to live off it. The language to them seemed quite  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:56):**  unnecessary I suppose and I think what that really came down to is that the way that they  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:02):**  are growing is something which has a very strong like cultural link. A lot of people  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:08):**  had learnt to grow food from their parents or grandparents as children on allotments  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:13):**  and it was just the way things are done which contrasts quite strongly to this other I would  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:18):**  say more mainstream narrative about regenerative farming being a kind of answer to climate  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:26):**  change a response to industrial farming whereas for the growers I was talking to there was  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:31):**  this continuity of this is how you farm there isn't another way and there's not really I  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:38):**  guess much to be gained from framing it as this kind of new response. When I read it  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:45):**  I really got that there was just a sort of knowing that was so integral so ingrained  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:51):**  that it was almost laughable these needs other people had to kind of define and make it into  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:58):**  something new. Definitely there was a kind of bemusement a lot of the time. One of the  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:04):**  most memorable days I had when I was spending time with some black growers was one of the  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:10):**  growers was trying to explain how to build some sort of bed and she was like let's just  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:16):**  go and do it because it's easier and so we did it we all understood and then kind of  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:21):**  at the end of the session she got up this video and she said oh I was teaching some  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:27):**  children how to do this bed yesterday and I had to show them this video and it was this  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:32):**  like narrated video with like this man with a very strong American accent and she was  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:37):**  laughing at it because she was like I never even knew this had a name but apparently it  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:42):**  does. This man has made a video to teach us how to do it but this is how I've always done  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:47):**  it this is how my parents did it and I think that was one of many very uplifting and kind  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:54):**  of powerful feelings that I felt throughout my research was actually that these growers  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:00):**  they don't feel as if they're missing out on something they kind of feel like everyone  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:05):**  else is missing out like we know this and everyone else is kind of catching up. Yes  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:10):**  we might be marginalized in structural ways but actually within the community we're doing  
**[0:29:16-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:16):**  it we don't really need this external validation necessarily although obviously people want  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:24):**  material access to things you know people need to be able to live there wasn't any need  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:30):**  to kind of be included beyond the kind of practical material way. So interesting and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:37):**  once you say it it makes a lot of sense. I totally get it but it's certainly not how  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:42):**  it's portrayed generally I would say from the predominantly white UK based alternative  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:49):**  farming movement as you called it. Yeah I think there is an understanding and an acknowledgement  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:55):**  of indigenous traditional farming methods within the wider alternative farming movement  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:02):**  I think that's growing but it's still kind of an afterthought and also I think what's  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:09):**  really missing from that narrative is not these practices are used by indigenous people  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:16):**  elsewhere. It's like people living and growing in the UK have been using these practices  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:23):**  and it's a really important way in which migrants from the African diaspora have continued cultural  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:30):**  traditions and continued to build community in the UK is through growing practices. When  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:36):**  black farmers and growers do have the platform within the space and are kind of speaking  
**[0:30:42-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:42):**  and sharing their experiences it's still framed as these people are super marginalised and  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:50):**  we need to sort of do more for them which in some ways is true but in other ways that  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:57):**  community have everything they need it's more about recognition and I think that there's  
**[0:31:02-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:02):**  not the really active desire to actually ask black people who are growing for their advice  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:11):**  and wisdom and I think that that's a massive oversight really because there's so much inherent  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:16):**  knowledge and wisdom within those communities and it's kind of being replicated elsewhere  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:21):**  without the acknowledgement that it's already happening. Totally. Was there anything other  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:28):**  than what we just spoke about that particularly surprised you positive or negative? Apart  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:34):**  from the reluctance to use the kind of language around agroecology there was also a reluctance  
**[0:31:41-0:31:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:41):**  to identify in racialised terms at all. I think there's an exceptionalist framing of  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:49):**  black people being farmers. When I was telling people about my research topic every person  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:56):**  that I spoke to who wasn't black was shocked that there was even one singular black farmer  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:02):**  people were like where are they and for that reason I can really understand why as a black  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:10):**  grower you would be infuriated by constantly having to refer to the fact that you're black  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:15):**  because that's not the point the point is you're a grower and I think many people found  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:22):**  that whenever they were speaking to slightly external people that I was you know an academic  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:27):**  the whole conversation would be about race and it wouldn't get beyond that it wouldn't  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:30):**  actually get to the knowledge it would just be about what are your experiences of marginalisation  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:36):**  how have you been oppressed how difficult is it for you to exist in this space and understandably  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:42):**  that's really frustrating in a very narrow way to be perceived. So I was surprised at  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:49):**  first that they didn't really want to talk about race but actually as I spoke to them  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:53):**  more it became clear the reasons for that. It's kind of an assertion of like I am a farmer  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:58):**  I am a grower it doesn't matter that I'm not a white person. Yeah. For me that was a really  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:05):**  exciting part of what you were communicating or finding in the dissertation was this kind  
**[0:33:11-0:33:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:11):**  of occupation of the space by black farmers but it was like a jubilant knowing kind of  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:19):**  ownership of what they're doing that's like way beyond anything that anyone could confine  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:26):**  them to. It just felt like it was an expression of being and that this idea that race was  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:33):**  the only framing that we could give you know these people was very restrictive and like  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:38):**  the radical act for them was to just bat that off and be like don't reduce me to something  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:45):**  that you're trying to frame me in. There's such a focus on joy as well and celebration  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:51):**  and I think that that's also really important for communities that have almost had this  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:58):**  expectation of suffering kind of put onto them. Like people expect that they're going  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:04):**  to have all these really troubling stories of marginalisation to tell them and sure those  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:11):**  stories do exist but the focus when I was speaking to people was the joy and the connection  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:17):**  and the community and the love and like you say this occupation of the space with no need  
**[0:34:23-0:34:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:23):**  to excuse themselves or explain why they were there.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:43):**  What do you think about what Dora was saying what she found?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:46):**  I think it's really interesting to see how like she was drawn to this side of things  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:50):**  like farming as well as like racial justice and how in her research wanting to like tie  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:56):**  them together but then for like a lot of the participants to not have the same roots into  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:02):**  food growing and especially regarding like their racial identity and I think you know  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:09):**  obviously with Lion like we are a political collective and using black and people of colour  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:16):**  is like a political label of solidarity to highlight the ways in which systemic racism  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:23):**  has a role within agro-ecological farming as well as land ownership and so on and so  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:30):**  for me it's always really interesting to see and hear from folks where like that's not  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:35):**  a central part of it and I think it is very different when you're an activist doing organising  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:40):**  or if it's a clearly political space as opposed to just someone who has a hobby and you know  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:46):**  like the fact that people cannot believe that there are other black growers even though  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:52):**  you know there's so many people who are growing who are not white who are farmers across the  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:57):**  world.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:58):**  Yeah I think it's really great to see how different people also see these labels of  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:06):**  organic or permaculture or sustainable as like just these modern terms for ways of farming  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:13):**  and ways of working with the land that are older than these labels in a way.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:19):**  Yeah I don't know why the norm for farming more broadly should be seen to be intensive  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:25):**  agriculture when we've been farming in these other ways for so long and across the world.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:31):**  And it's totally tied with colonialism and capitalism like you can't separate the two  
**[0:36:36-0:36:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:36):**  like within like a lot of the colonies intensive farming was a way of making as much money  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:44):**  as possible by having like the highest yields and harvest and so on and that was only made  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:51):**  possible through like a subjugated labour force whether they were enslaved or indentured  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:57):**  workers or even with you know the enclosures in Britain right like you take up more and  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:02):**  more land so that you can have livestock farming rather than having a diverse farming practice  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:09):**  or whatever and I see like the connection is like this long line of like this one particular  
**[0:37:16-0:37:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:16):**  way of growing food that you use scientific resources in order to maintain or support  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:25):**  you know like it benefits people who own a lot of land it benefits the wealthiest as  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:31):**  opposed to like the person trying to like just feed themselves and their family and  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:36):**  this is why we can't separate the countryside from the urban spaces because through displacing  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:42):**  people you create this landless wage labour force.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:47):**  Yeah so just got to stop ranting about capitalism but like it's like inextricable to be if  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:55):**  we're talking about methods of farming and why they came about.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:00):**  Yeah never stop ranting.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:09):**  I used to live out towards more of a rural kind of countryside area.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:17):**  At first being in those spaces made me feel really uncomfortable and I couldn't quite  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:21):**  put my finger on what it was for a while.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:24):**  I remember kind of walking around those spaces and feeling like a bit of an intruder to be  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:31):**  honest and as though I as a person of colour didn't necessarily belong in those spaces  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:40):**  because the majority of the people around that area and also that had monopoly on those  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:47):**  areas they were white and to come into that space from being an urban space where a lot  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:54):**  of the people around me looked like me and spoke like me to then walk among these fields  
**[0:38:58-0:39:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:58):**  and feel like oh this this doesn't feel like I associate farming with whiteness.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:06):**  It has taken quite a long time to deconstruct that and to understand that I have just as  
**[0:39:11-0:39:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:11):**  much claim and agency in these green spaces as anyone else.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:23):**  To some extent to feel at home here is to have a strong sort of social network to have  
**[0:39:32-0:39:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:32):**  people around you that support you that affirm who you are and not always question you.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:41):**  Where you can see some of yourself reflected around you, where you can see an affirmation  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:49):**  of who you are, where you feel your skills are valued or that you're not constantly put  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:58):**  into a box as being different I suppose and that you don't have to prove yourself all  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:04):**  the time.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:05):**  I always felt that as somebody who was seen as different and not necessarily from here  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:14):**  I always had to authenticate that I actually knew about rural in some ways I almost had  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:20):**  to sort of say well you know I have lived on a craft we have established a business  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:26):**  you know I've lived in rural areas I had to justify myself so it's to develop a sort of  
**[0:40:30-0:40:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:30):**  context where people don't constantly have to think of themselves of the other.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:38):**  People of colour and black people more generally we've never really felt welcomed in kind of  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:43):**  rural quote unquote sort of wild spaces.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:48):**  I'm speaking about it specifically around the UK but I know that this is obviously true  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:52):**  in the US and lots of other parts of the world as well where people in the global majority  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:57):**  aren't usually recognised as belonging they're not recognised as being faces that you would  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:02):**  expect to see in green areas.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:07):**  I like to use words just like green spaces because it just feels a little bit less loaded  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:11):**  than things like rural or wild or any of these words that also I think probably have some  
**[0:41:16-0:41:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:16):**  kind of colonial history and are just very human centric I guess.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:24):**  We get to look at history we get to look at the botanists who did have the access to be  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:29):**  able to study and explore these fields and again they failed to look like us and sometimes  
**[0:41:36-0:41:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:36):**  that's down to structures that award privileges to certain communities but yeah it's sad that  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:45):**  botany and horticulture and just plants and non-human beings just connecting with anything  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:52):**  is seen as something that should be commodified and made inaccessible.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:58):**  They just keep it white dominated that's the truth.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:02):**  It's awfully angular that may be a little politically incorrect but I think it's not  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:10):**  to be rude or to demean anybody's experience but we all look around and I even have friends  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:16):**  within the white community that can honestly open up and say this space is not inclusive  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:21):**  this space tokenises a lot of individuals when it does award opportunities it would  
**[0:42:28-0:42:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:28):**  mature either caricature or experiences and actually allow us the room to grow and explore.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:38):**  For me in my life now living in Edinburgh there's really like such a lack of like I  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:45):**  haven't found a community in Edinburgh of growers or like people interested in specifically  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:51):**  talking about food growing or just like any kind of growing that isn't majority white  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:56):**  middle class that is just what it is there and I live with a lot of people and I'm around  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:01):**  a lot of people who are super into foraging and like tapping into traditional ways of  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:08):**  growing and like connecting with nature and I feel like quite separate from that because  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:14):**  I just feel like yeah I just feel like it's a very white space and I think it's great  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:20):**  that there is a space of people doing that but I have a bit of a block with it.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:24):**  I always think like that's something that I'm so interested in like why am I not doing  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:27):**  it and I realised because it's totally about the community for me and I think it's just  
**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:33):**  I don't feel like it's a space that I am part of or like that is accessible to me or not  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:41):**  even that it's like I would enjoy it a lot more if it was people that were like me you  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:44):**  know or that people that I could relate with and so I guess I would hope to find a way  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:49):**  to be a part of something like that so that I could learn more about growing and I could  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:54):**  just be more active like implement it more into my life I think yeah so I hope I can  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:00):**  find that.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:01):**  Yeah you will.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:02):**  Yeah I will yeah.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:06):**  I think the more inwards I have been going and reconnecting with myself and my identity  
**[0:44:11-0:44:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:11):**  as a brown person, a person of colour, I have been feeling more and more connected to the  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:19):**  land and more and more as though it kind of is a part of my DNA.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:27):**  My ancestors were from the land, they were brought up on the land, they used the land  
**[0:44:35-0:44:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:35):**  and I guess like earth magic to nourish themselves and heal themselves and I want to be able  
**[0:44:45-0:45:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:45):**  to honour that and carry that forward also.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:00):**  The last piece we're going to hear is a visioning piece from you Sam.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:04):**  What was important to you in recording and sharing this?  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:07):**  I think I wanted to record this piece because I want to try and imagine what is this world  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:14):**  that we are working towards.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:16):**  I think so often within lefty activist spaces we're always like fighting against reacting  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:23):**  against and it can often seem like the issue is like oh it's just about representation  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:28):**  especially around like identity-based politics and so on and I don't think it is just about  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:35):**  getting you know some like black or Asian or whatever students at your horticultural  
**[0:45:43-0:45:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:43):**  college or having more black landowners or farmers or even having like a queer boss,  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:51):**  I don't know, boss beekeeper.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:53):**  You know like for me I'm just like how does this change?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:56):**  How can getting more queer folks and women and people of colour onto the land and into  
**[0:46:05-0:46:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:05):**  land work, how can that actually work towards changing the structural experiences of marginalised  
**[0:46:14-0:46:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:14):**  groups like these you know and how can it be also tied with climate justice and land  
**[0:46:22-0:46:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:22):**  justice and challenging the existing systems of oppression that mean that we feel so isolated  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:31):**  at times or so separate from the land.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:34):**  I think a big part of this work is like just dreaming and imagining together and we need  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:40):**  that because that's how we that's how we get change.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:44):**  I think we're in this very difficult time in history where there's a lot of backlash  
**[0:46:50-0:47:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:50):**  whenever we talk about rural racism or about queer identities within rural spaces because  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:00):**  there is this attachment to the rural idyll which is this myth of an unchanging timeless  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:09):**  or out of time place which is just filled with like really friendly white people who  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:16):**  all know each other and have known each other for generations and it's sort of untouched  
**[0:47:22-0:47:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:22):**  by all of the degradation of urban spaces whether that is you know sex positivity or  
**[0:47:31-0:47:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:31):**  like sexual diversity or you know racism and anti-racist movements and migration and different  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:42):**  cultures intermixing and at times maybe even coming into conflict with each other so there's  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:48):**  like this idea that black and people of colour and queer people are relegated to the cities  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:54):**  and the city you can be around all of this really exciting diversity like these places  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:59):**  of change that is so much change constantly that you're struggling to keep up and rural  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:05):**  spaces are like this escape this place where you can go to like restore yourself to heal  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:10):**  or you go when you can't handle living in a city anymore.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:15):**  I think as a queer person and as a person of colour a black person I find it really  
**[0:48:22-0:48:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:22):**  heartbreaking at times because I can see how living in a city and in London it can be so  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:29):**  damaging to our health whether that's our mental health or our physical health like  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:34):**  you know we're living under an economic system that doesn't value people's health and well-being  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:41):**  people living in the most deprived areas and usually urban areas are more likely to be  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:47):**  exposed to higher amounts of air pollution and are less likely to be able to access green  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:53):**  spaces and nature spaces and so on and you know it's just proven that these things are  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:58):**  good for your physical health as well as your mental health.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:01):**  There's like this one like why do people live here and like I think if you're a queer person  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:05):**  or a person of colour you know you're seeking community you're seeking somewhere that you  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:09):**  can feel safe but also you experience a lot of structural discrimination that means if  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:15):**  you aren't able to assimilate and look and act and speak a certain way you have a lot  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:20):**  less opportunities available to you.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:23):**  Being able to like set up communities you know being able to live in rural spaces without  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:29):**  varying isolation or discrimination and you know it's one thing if like a nuclear family  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:36):**  unit goes and moves into this place or like whether they're queer or whether they're black  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:42):**  or Asian or whatever you're always going to feel like an outsider and be a lot more exposed.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:48):**  What would it be like if we could just go and live in a small town or village or set  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:54):**  up our own land projects but also still connect to the communities there because I think there's  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:59):**  like this desire also from people who live in these areas to not feel like they're stuck  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:04):**  in the past and also to feel like they're not forgotten as well.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:09):**  Is there a way that we can create a new way of being in the countryside and being on the  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:14):**  land that doesn't feel like you're just living like this fantasy cottagecore existence but  
**[0:50:20-0:50:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:20):**  actually is so much about creating a new way of being in rural spaces that feels as dynamic  
**[0:50:27-0:50:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:27):**  and exciting and vital as when you're in the city but then rather than being driven by  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:34):**  like the sense of urgency which I think can happen a lot with activist organising I think  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:39):**  it's important for us to actually think about what does it mean to set down roots and also  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:43):**  to do it in a way that is forging relationships with the people who have been there before.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:50):**  And I think the other side of it is not to think that a land and food justice movement  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:54):**  or climate justice movement has to be based in the countryside either.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:59):**  I think there's ways that we could transform cities like London into being nourishing places  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:06):**  for anyone to live in.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:09):**  The fact is that so many people do grow up here or live here but then we don't feel like  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:14):**  a sense of ownership or ability to change the spaces we're in as much as we want to  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:21):**  because of how controlled we are in these spaces.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:26):**  How can that connection between the rural and the urban happen in a way that is really  
**[0:51:32-0:51:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:32):**  transformative?  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:33):**  How can we have less cars and more accessible affordable public transportation, more green  
**[0:51:40-0:51:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:40):**  spaces and nature reserves within cities, more agro-ecological farming and mini forests  
**[0:51:48-0:51:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:48):**  in cities, more green zones in between very residential areas, less pollution, more people  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:57):**  being able to have beautiful spaces that they can rest and relax in, learn about food growing  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:03):**  or carpentry or other skills within these urban spaces so it's not just seeing that  
**[0:52:08-0:52:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:08):**  you either live in a countryside or you live in a city.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:17):**  We've lost a lot of things.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:19):**  We've lost the ability to have cheap or free housing or organizing spaces or just places  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:27):**  to rest and ways to rest and access healing therapies and so on.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:33):**  These are things that are hard to navigate on your own and that's why it's more and more  
**[0:52:36-0:52:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:36):**  essential that we create the resources and the spaces that we need whether we are in  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:43):**  urban or rural spaces and that they are not this binary separate thing.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:48):**  They are connected and essential for us to actually create a transformative movement  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:54):**  you know and if we're talking about land justice, land justice implicates all the things that  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:00):**  you find in urban spaces too from housing to ideas about use of land and there's a lot  
**[0:53:07-0:53:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:07):**  of different things that land justice can mean also when we're thinking about cities.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:15):**  It's about trying to tell a new story drawing on what we've learned from collective organizing,  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:23):**  what we learned from queer organizing, what we've learned from anti-racist organizing  
**[0:53:29-0:53:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:29):**  over the past centuries about you know how can we do it in a way that isn't just propping  
**[0:53:36-0:53:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:36):**  up the state or heteronormative ways of living and working together.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:43):**  What if we're not even paying attention to that, we tell our own stories, we share our  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:47):**  own narratives, we archive our own organizing in its own ways that we just focus on like  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:53):**  building really solid foundations and relationships and communities so that we have a really resilient  
**[0:53:59-0:54:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:59):**  movement.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:11):**  Thanks so much for listening to Cultivating Justice.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:14):**  Cultivating Justice isn't just this podcast series, we've also made some zines and Sam  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:19):**  do you want to tell us a bit about those?  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:21):**  Yeah so as we've talked about in previous episodes, Marcus published a zine called  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:26):**  Gourds, Banjers and Callaloo which you can read on Lion's website and you can order a  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:32):**  reprint as well from our store.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:34):**  We've also got a zine called Transplants made up of submissions from lots of different folks  
**[0:54:40-0:54:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:40):**  looking at querying and decolonizing botany and yeah you can get that zine as well as  
**[0:54:48-0:54:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:48):**  some merch like t-shirts, vests, caps, patches and so on all from Lion's website.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:55):**  The link will be in our show notes.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:06):**  Queer vision of land justice means visibility really, visibility of queer bodies in the  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:20):**  landscape.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:21):**  You know, there's a lot of queer people who would like to or do currently do land based  
**[0:55:32-0:55:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:32):**  work but there's a lot of people who feel excluded from that space, really, most often  
**[0:55:42-0:55:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:42):**  but not entirely.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:45):**  Yeah so queer vision of land justice is simply just there being a non-judgmental safe space  
**[0:55:50-0:55:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:50):**  for all queers to be in and take up space.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:57):**  I just think everyone should be, in inverted commas I suppose, allowed, that everyone's  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:04):**  allowed to be in nature.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:08):**  Nature's for everyone.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:10):**  I'm really talking from quite a privileged position where I can be, you know, out at  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:16):**  work and get to where I want, which is nice.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:22):**  It's not always been the case.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:26):**  I think I'm really privileged in that way and globally like there's just really a lot  
**[0:56:33-0:56:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:33):**  of work to be done but I just really don't think that nature should be the place that  
**[0:56:43-0:56:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:43):**  is just solely thought of as a, you know, white, cis, heteronormative, able bodied space.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:55):**  I just think it should be there for people who are neurodivergent, people, all the people,  
**[0:57:05-0:57:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:05):**  because it's just really important for me, for my mental health and I think it really  
**[0:57:08-0:57:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:08):**  would be for a lot of others.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:15):**  For me, I suppose it's about access to the land for everyone but it's key that it's not  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:22):**  just about that, it's also about changing cultures and attitudes which are no longer  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:27):**  relevant.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:28):**  It's about moving away from extractive, short-term and selfish approaches towards a more inclusive  
**[0:57:36-0:57:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:36):**  world where everyone can flourish on a land which in itself is respected and valued as  
**[0:57:44-0:57:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:44):**  the source of all our wellbeing and livelihoods.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:54):**  So I'd just like to close this off by thanking everybody who followed.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:00):**  I hope I was somewhat cohesive.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:02):**  I hope I've done some justice in amplifying something.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:07):**  It's quite a struggle but I do think there's definitely a desire and a need for more representation  
**[0:58:14-0:58:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:14):**  and not just tokenistic representation but actual inclusive representation.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:24):**  I know what that looks like and I think many individuals within this space know what that  
**[0:58:28-0:58:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:28):**  looks like and they are facilitating the creation of it but it takes other individuals ensuring  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:36):**  that we're not using these terminologies as a buzzword.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:40):**  It takes people stepping up and having difficult conversations and listening.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:46):**  I've told a fraction of my story and I hope that's given some insight, a vague insight  
**[0:58:52-0:58:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:52):**  into just a perspective but I know there's many other stories out there and listening  
**[0:58:58-0:59:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:58):**  is probably the best thing that people can do.

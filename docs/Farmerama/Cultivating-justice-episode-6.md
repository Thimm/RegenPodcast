### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:00):**  She had a dream once where she realized that her experience and her consciousness and her  desire was just the sum total of all of her cells and bacteria, her organs and parts,  all held together in her skin, ornamented with painted nails and long brushed hair,  
**[0:00:35-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:00:35):**  and sometimes salted with beads of sweat and mucosal trickles, inlaid with eyes that were  often looked into or away from. All of these parts were willing themselves into a hole,  working together just to stay alive and within that necessitating the illusion of her.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:06):**  Cultivating Justice eliminate justice. Cultivating Justice Episode 6  Before we get into the episode, a heads up that includes discussions of trauma, racism  and colonialism. Please take care as you listen.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:01:49):**  Three, two, one. Welcome to Culting Justice.  I'm Hester Russell. I'm a grower and an organiser for Out on the Land.  I'm Sam Siva. I'm a grower, writer and organiser with Land in Our Names.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:05):**  And I'm Katie Revel. I'm part of the Farmerama team and I produced this series, so I've been  helping to pull everything together.  The clip we just heard is taken from a performance by artists in Wai Kin. It mixes their sounds  
**[0:02:18-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:18):**  and poetry with music from the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto and recordings from Oceans  and Compost Piles.  In this episode, we'll hear from a therapist about healing the trauma of being separated  
**[0:02:30-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:30):**  from the land.  We'll learn about the surprising findings of a study into the experiences of black farmers.  And Sam, you're going to close the series with your vision of what the land and food  
**[0:02:41-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:02:41):**  justice movement could look like if it centred queer frameworks, anti-racism and reparations.  Shrikant Narayanan is a Glasgow-based psychotherapist. The interview we're about to hear was actually  recorded by Col Gordon for Farmerama's Landed series, which explored colonial legacy, land  
**[0:03:03-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:03):**  reform, reparations, food justice, traditional Gaelic land relations and lots and lots of  other things as well.  That interview covered a lot of ground and it really stuck with me. As is often the case,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:18):**  a lot of it didn't make it into the final series and so I'm really glad that we can  share some more of it here.  The bit we're about to hear, I think, really chimes with a lot of the themes of the Cultivating  
**[0:03:29-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:29):**  Justice Project. So thank you to Shrikant and to Col for letting us include it. So as  I said, Shrikant is a psychotherapist.  One of my particular interests is eco-psychology. That's really about all the relationships  
**[0:03:45-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:03:45):**  that we have as an ecosystem, relationships between humans and relationships between humans  and the other than human, which includes the land in general. And another part of the work  that I do is that I'm a grower, I guess an aspiring farmer, and seeking my own relationship  
**[0:04:08-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:08):**  with the land and with food in a way that maybe brings all of these interests together.  I guess one of the questions that I have is, like, is there a psychology of our relationships  to the land and to plants and to forests and to the ocean? Where did those relationships  
**[0:04:31-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:31):**  come from? Are there any other ways that this relationship could be? It's almost like coming  from the other direction when we really experience a connection with the land. We can experience  it in a way where we know that although it's different from us, there really is a kind  
**[0:04:50-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:04:50):**  of bond there, that in some ways nature is not something that's outside of us. And I  guess that many of us who work on the land have experienced that at some point. It's  also something that's really easy to slip away from. It's not the common currency of  
**[0:05:08-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:08):**  our culture in the West. It's not the way that the sort of systems that coordinate and  control our lives, economic systems, work. So there's a kind of mismatch there. And there's  a kind of questioning that you can get into about where did that separation, that mismatch  
**[0:05:26-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:26):**  come from? How far back does it go? And part of it is that people have been across the  world, but especially in places that were colonised, they've been removed from their  land or their land has been occupied. That individuals have also been moved from the  
**[0:05:46-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:05:46):**  land because of perhaps economic forces. And also when did we start looking at the land  as something that is just there for us to take from? That's a question that maybe the  answers really go back to when we started needing agriculture. We needed to organise  
**[0:06:01-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:01):**  ways to have the land provide for us. And so if we really want to answer those questions  or redefine our relationships, we need to find those places in ourselves where those  wounds still exist. The pain of losing that connection. And I guess that's part of the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:22):**  work that I'm interested in is where are the places in ourselves where we hide from that  wound, where we can't acknowledge that, because we need that back if we're to reconnect.  The most straightforward way of talking about it is about trauma. That there's a traumatic  
**[0:06:48-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:06:48):**  loss that's taken place. That there was a connection there that isn't there anymore.  So a lot of the process is about working with trauma. It's about finding those places in  ourselves that we've alienated, which we've kind of decided maybe because of forces outside  
**[0:07:09-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:09):**  of us are other or need to be controlled or need to be shackled in some way or productive  way. And kind of giving them back some agency, taking the chains off. And that often releases  a lot of pain. Looking at it through the lens of trauma is quite useful because it's quite  
**[0:07:31-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:31):**  a well recognised thing now that trauma can be passed down from generation to generation.  That those wounds that we have are not just our own and we may be holding things that  have been there for generations. So we're not just healing them for ourselves. We're  
**[0:07:49-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:07:49):**  healing them because something is calling us from potentially many generations ago.  And that's part of the way that we've lost touch with these things is because in the  West, certainly there's been a real focus on individual pursuit, individual psychology.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:05):**  You do your work, become a better person and then life is fine. And when we look more collectively,  we see that we're all holding things for each other and for generations that have preceded  us. So I guess the responsibility there is to like, well, if we start to look at those  
**[0:08:28-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:28):**  things and work with those things, then we don't need to pass them on as wounds. These  are things that call us and it's up to us to answer the call. Many, many of us know  that it's there, but it's easy to ignore it and just get on with the lives that have  
**[0:08:44-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:08:44):**  been laid out for us. I guess when we're talking about how we might have colonised peoples  and lands, we're talking about the way that the powerful have come to dominate the less  powerful. And in some ways, this is something that all of us as humans in relationship to  
**[0:09:02-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:02):**  the land and to the other than human have to wrestle with, which is how are we coming  to dominate those other things with which we're working or being alongside or living  with? Because that's a very particular kind of relationship, the relationship that I need  
**[0:09:21-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:21):**  to control you. I need you to produce for me. I need you to appear when I say you need  to appear and go away when I say you need to go away. It's a very particular kind of  relationship which nowadays we really, really question when it comes to human relationships,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:41):**  but maybe less so when it comes to relationships with the land. One of the things that I'm  really interested in is how can we question that kind of need to control, that kind of  need to impose our power on the land, on the other than human? Which is not to say that  
**[0:09:59-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:09:59):**  we stop needing things or receiving from the land. It's just to say that we do so in a  relationship that is more mutual, maybe more respectful, that respects the processes that  are going on that are not ours. Part of that loss of that kind of relationship, of mutuality,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:32):**  a reciprocal relationship, is guilt about the need to control, guilt about the ways  in which we might need to exploit the other, which needs to be processed. And these are  huge things. They're in the coloniser, in the person who's doing the controlling. And  
**[0:10:53-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:10:53):**  we can go through life very practically and not really question them, partly because that  is supported by the culture that we're in predominantly. So it takes a really big step  to kind of stop and kind of go, ah, no, but actually there's a part of me that feels this  
**[0:11:10-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:10):**  guilt. There's a part of me that feels that pain and that doesn't want to have that relationship.  That can be quite subtle work and it can be quite painful work and it requires some grieving  of what was lost. But that's part of a healing process. Just by acknowledging those parts  
**[0:11:31-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:11:31):**  of ourselves, we start to see the pain and let it breathe. And that's the way we find  our way back. There's nothing wrong with intellectualising it. In fact, that can be a really great way  in the intellectual debate about decolonisation, domestication, undomestication, finding connection  
**[0:12:01-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:01):**  is valuable, but it's not where the experience lies. The experience and the trauma and the  wounds are in our bodies, in our souls. And if we really want that connection, we have  to engage with it in the ways that our bodies engage with it. It's looking at ourselves  
**[0:12:21-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:21):**  as nature, as living organisms, as creatures with a soul. And part of the way we might  start to do that is through our bodies, through how we relate physically to the land. So for  me, some of those things in more practical terms are about movement, are about sound,  
**[0:12:47-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:12:47):**  are about dance, about ritual, about ceremony. Those things are really important when we're  trying to engage ourselves more deeply in a relationship. They speak to us at a level  which the words and the ideas maybe can't get at.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:24):**  What are your takeaways from Srikanth's piece?  One thing I find really interesting is the role that language plays in shaping our understanding  of reality, shaping the way that we actually see the world and the fact that it can also  
**[0:13:38-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:38):**  really restrict that understanding. One of the reasons language matters is that if we  are able to find new ways or maybe rediscover old ways of talking about the other than human  or the more than human world and getting away from terms that are common at the moment,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:13:58):**  like nature or the environment, maybe that can help us get away from this false dichotomy  that Srikanth was talking about between humans and the rest of the world. It takes a conscious  effort because we're so habituated to these ways of talking and therefore these ways of  
**[0:14:17-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:17):**  thinking that do entrench that divide. Even if in our hearts we understand that there  is no divide, the language that we have to hand forces us to perpetuate that divide.  I would totally agree with that. I think this language of human exceptionalism and separation  
**[0:14:41-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:14:41):**  from the ecosystems that we work and exploit has really been the vehicle for a lot of the  violence that we've perpetrated on the planet and on living things and on each other. I  think like you say, it is a conscious effort to reconfigure that language, but I do think  
**[0:15:01-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:01):**  that that's a really important part of knitting ourselves back into the natural world. I don't  know, it can feel quite weird trying to adopt these new, I want to say made up terms, but  obviously all language is made up. But when you're trying to import a engineered concept,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:20):**  I think it can feel quite inauthentic. But I think you just have to push through that  moment, don't you? Because that is the real way that we can reimagine.  Another thing for me that Srikanth touches on at the end is not intellectualising and  
**[0:15:37-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:15:37):**  the embodiment of this healing and being embodied on the land. That really resonated with me.  I thought quite a lot about how important ritual is and how impoverished I feel in terms  of ritual. I think particularly in perhaps like white British culture or something, we  
**[0:16:01-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:01):**  don't have much ritual and we've kind of come away from it. Sometimes there's a bit of discomfort  or an embarrassment in trying to recreate that, which I've definitely felt. But I feel,  yeah, it's really important to me to try and find an authentic voice in ritual and celebration  
**[0:16:22-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:22):**  and reconnecting in that sort of embodied and collective way.  I definitely haven't found a route through that for myself and I absolutely get that  kind of squeamishness. Trying to participate in ritual or in ceremony without feeling like  
**[0:16:41-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:41):**  it has to be cloaked in sort of irony or self-consciousness or sarcasm is a real challenge, but I think  is really important.  Yeah, and those are sort of deflection mechanisms, aren't they? But yeah, and I think that feeling  
**[0:16:58-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:16:58):**  that it's going to be appropriative or extractive from other cultures is a product of us not  dealing with our colonial history and our ongoing profiting.  And also there is a culture within hippie and the countercultural movement in the sixties  
**[0:17:18-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:18):**  and seventies where it was literally appropriation and that's still very present here. But I  think there are ways to have ritual and so much of what Srikanth is talking about is  how just connecting to the land, just being within that relationship with the land is  
**[0:17:37-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:37):**  actually like this is something that belongs to everyone. It's not bound by a specific  culture or whatever. This is just something that through industrialization, through colonialism  and being, I guess, for British folks as well or Northern European people in the recent  
**[0:17:55-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:17:55):**  history being beneficiaries or complicit in colonialism, how that further separates you  from each other and from the land.  And yeah, I think actually having that relationship with the land is a way of healing that and  
**[0:18:12-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:12):**  creating new ways of communing and building communities and so on.  Cultivating justice.  The song you're about to hear is called The Lark in the Morning by Egg Club 7. It's a  
**[0:18:30-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:30):**  reworking of a trad folk tune and the lyrics were inspired by the focus on women's liberation  in the Kurdish freedom movement. Although the lyrics come across as quite black and  white in terms of gender division, the broad aim was to remember patriarchy as a system  
**[0:18:44-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:18:44):**  rather than a gender. You can find the song on the LWA Stand Up Now album.  And the Lark in the morning she rises up fast and she goes up in the air with a jewel of  stars and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes home in the  
**[0:19:11-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:11):**  evening by the land that keeps the wind.  The ash tree, the ash in the valley down the hill, it could be a hundred and a fifty years  through storm and gale and still. Strangled by the ivy and dye ballooning on the weather  
**[0:19:43-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:19:43):**  but not here there's all the growth the sap will rise alone. The ivy'll deceive you by  its stranded tendencies as it goes up and scaling all the branches on the trees. And  while it's young and nimble the dawn of truth is numbling as it goes thick and heavy and  
**[0:20:01-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:01):**  bears the wits of old age and the young.  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:20:17-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:17):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  For years by the hundred of life under these mounds these batches have a home to feed and  sleep under the ground. And men with mega projects they tell turn around saying go back into  
**[0:20:51-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:20:51):**  your home okay you will bury you down. The teeth and clothes of badgers are no match  for the state but every tooth and every claw of every animal chases. The wind brings the  story of blood from off the weep to the ecology of all life under the men that stamp their  
**[0:21:10-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:10):**  feet.  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:21:23-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:21:23):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  A man is not like I, he owes his status quo, you'll hear it in the folk song and the story  days of old. He owns a savage hunt and tends his family from above along with the Lark in  
**[0:22:13-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:13):**  the morning as a symbol for love. So anytime that a woman gets an order from a man or language  dropping up the dominant story all is planned. We have to fight it for our lives with all  the wisdom and the oath. Cause nothing lives in freedom in a world that's ruled by ghosts.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:33):**  Cause nothing lives in freedom in a world that's ruled by ghosts.  The Lark in the morning she rises off her nest and she goes up in the air with a jewel  on her breasts and like the old tall ash tree she whistles and she sings and then she goes  
**[0:22:49-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:22:49):**  home in the evening by the hand that keeps the wind.  Now we're going to listen to a chat between executive producers Abby and Dora on the show.  Dora did some research into the experience of black farmers and what she found challenged  
**[0:23:55-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:23:55):**  her assumptions about why and how black people farm.  The title is race exclusion and enterprise exploring the place of black farmers in the  UK's alternative farming movement. I was studying a MA in food anthropology and I'd  
**[0:24:13-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:13):**  been becoming really interested in the kind of alternative food and farming movement as  an answer to climate change. And then kind of outside of my studies I'd also been engaging  more with my black community and kind of learning more about anti-racism and getting more into  
**[0:24:35-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:35):**  activism. And I kind of began to realize that those two things were linked. So I decided  to talk to some black farmers and growers to kind of see whether those like anti-racist  narratives were kind of coming into their growing. If you'd like to share some of your  
**[0:24:58-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:24:58):**  key findings from those explorations that'd be great. When I set out on the dissertation  like I had to have a kind of research question that I was attempting to answer and my question  was how are black British farmers and growers linking anti-racism with their farming practices.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:21):**  And I was working with farmers and growers who are growing in non-intensive ways so whatever  you want to call that but broadly agroecological methods. And because of the kind of literature  that I've been reading which that isn't that much of but what is there and the kind of  
**[0:25:38-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:25:38):**  spokespeople within this space I was expecting all of these growers to have a very clear  rhetorical link between we grow in this non-extractive regenerative way because it reflects broader  arguments around decolonization around anti-racism around land justice. And actually when I spoke  
**[0:26:03-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:03):**  to people although that was definitely there it was never their primary motivation and  instead that link was very much implicit. When I asked whether that link was there a  lot of the growers were almost kind of confused that I was asking it was self-evident to them  
**[0:26:22-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:22):**  that of course it is that's what we do. And I think with that there was also this reluctance  to use the language I guess of the regenerative farming movement. I asked people growing in  an organic or an agroecological way their reasons behind it and a lot of growers were  
**[0:26:43-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:26:43):**  very wary of using those terms. One woman said to me organic just means it's from the  earth sustainable just means we're able to live off it. The language to them seemed quite  unnecessary I suppose and I think what that really came down to is that the way that they  
**[0:27:02-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:02):**  are growing is something which has a very strong like cultural link. A lot of people  had learnt to grow food from their parents or grandparents as children on allotments  and it was just the way things are done which contrasts quite strongly to this other I would  
**[0:27:18-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:18):**  say more mainstream narrative about regenerative farming being a kind of answer to climate  change a response to industrial farming whereas for the growers I was talking to there was  this continuity of this is how you farm there isn't another way and there's not really I  
**[0:27:38-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:38):**  guess much to be gained from framing it as this kind of new response. When I read it  I really got that there was just a sort of knowing that was so integral so ingrained  that it was almost laughable these needs other people had to kind of define and make it into  
**[0:27:58-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:27:58):**  something new. Definitely there was a kind of bemusement a lot of the time. One of the  most memorable days I had when I was spending time with some black growers was one of the  growers was trying to explain how to build some sort of bed and she was like let's just  
**[0:28:16-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:16):**  go and do it because it's easier and so we did it we all understood and then kind of  at the end of the session she got up this video and she said oh I was teaching some  children how to do this bed yesterday and I had to show them this video and it was this  
**[0:28:32-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:32):**  like narrated video with like this man with a very strong American accent and she was  laughing at it because she was like I never even knew this had a name but apparently it  does. This man has made a video to teach us how to do it but this is how I've always done  
**[0:28:47-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:28:47):**  it this is how my parents did it and I think that was one of many very uplifting and kind  of powerful feelings that I felt throughout my research was actually that these growers  they don't feel as if they're missing out on something they kind of feel like everyone  
**[0:29:05-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:05):**  else is missing out like we know this and everyone else is kind of catching up. Yes  we might be marginalized in structural ways but actually within the community we're doing  it we don't really need this external validation necessarily although obviously people want  
**[0:29:24-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:24):**  material access to things you know people need to be able to live there wasn't any need  to kind of be included beyond the kind of practical material way. So interesting and  once you say it it makes a lot of sense. I totally get it but it's certainly not how  
**[0:29:42-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:29:42):**  it's portrayed generally I would say from the predominantly white UK based alternative  farming movement as you called it. Yeah I think there is an understanding and an acknowledgement  of indigenous traditional farming methods within the wider alternative farming movement  
**[0:30:02-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:02):**  I think that's growing but it's still kind of an afterthought and also I think what's  really missing from that narrative is not these practices are used by indigenous people  elsewhere. It's like people living and growing in the UK have been using these practices  
**[0:30:23-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:23):**  and it's a really important way in which migrants from the African diaspora have continued cultural  traditions and continued to build community in the UK is through growing practices. When  black farmers and growers do have the platform within the space and are kind of speaking  
**[0:30:42-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:30:42):**  and sharing their experiences it's still framed as these people are super marginalised and  we need to sort of do more for them which in some ways is true but in other ways that  community have everything they need it's more about recognition and I think that there's  
**[0:31:02-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:02):**  not the really active desire to actually ask black people who are growing for their advice  and wisdom and I think that that's a massive oversight really because there's so much inherent  knowledge and wisdom within those communities and it's kind of being replicated elsewhere  
**[0:31:21-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:21):**  without the acknowledgement that it's already happening. Totally. Was there anything other  than what we just spoke about that particularly surprised you positive or negative? Apart  from the reluctance to use the kind of language around agroecology there was also a reluctance  
**[0:31:41-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:31:41):**  to identify in racialised terms at all. I think there's an exceptionalist framing of  black people being farmers. When I was telling people about my research topic every person  that I spoke to who wasn't black was shocked that there was even one singular black farmer  
**[0:32:02-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:02):**  people were like where are they and for that reason I can really understand why as a black  grower you would be infuriated by constantly having to refer to the fact that you're black  because that's not the point the point is you're a grower and I think many people found  
**[0:32:22-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:22):**  that whenever they were speaking to slightly external people that I was you know an academic  the whole conversation would be about race and it wouldn't get beyond that it wouldn't  actually get to the knowledge it would just be about what are your experiences of marginalisation  
**[0:32:36-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:36):**  how have you been oppressed how difficult is it for you to exist in this space and understandably  that's really frustrating in a very narrow way to be perceived. So I was surprised at  first that they didn't really want to talk about race but actually as I spoke to them  
**[0:32:53-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:32:53):**  more it became clear the reasons for that. It's kind of an assertion of like I am a farmer  I am a grower it doesn't matter that I'm not a white person. Yeah. For me that was a really  exciting part of what you were communicating or finding in the dissertation was this kind  
**[0:33:11-0:33:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:11):**  of occupation of the space by black farmers but it was like a jubilant knowing kind of  ownership of what they're doing that's like way beyond anything that anyone could confine  them to. It just felt like it was an expression of being and that this idea that race was  
**[0:33:33-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:33):**  the only framing that we could give you know these people was very restrictive and like  the radical act for them was to just bat that off and be like don't reduce me to something  that you're trying to frame me in. There's such a focus on joy as well and celebration  
**[0:33:51-0:34:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:33:51):**  and I think that that's also really important for communities that have almost had this  expectation of suffering kind of put onto them. Like people expect that they're going  to have all these really troubling stories of marginalisation to tell them and sure those  
**[0:34:11-0:34:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:11):**  stories do exist but the focus when I was speaking to people was the joy and the connection  and the community and the love and like you say this occupation of the space with no need  to excuse themselves or explain why they were there.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:43):**  What do you think about what Dora was saying what she found?  I think it's really interesting to see how like she was drawn to this side of things  like farming as well as like racial justice and how in her research wanting to like tie  
**[0:34:56-0:35:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:34:56):**  them together but then for like a lot of the participants to not have the same roots into  food growing and especially regarding like their racial identity and I think you know  obviously with Lion like we are a political collective and using black and people of colour  
**[0:35:16-0:35:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:16):**  is like a political label of solidarity to highlight the ways in which systemic racism  has a role within agro-ecological farming as well as land ownership and so on and so  for me it's always really interesting to see and hear from folks where like that's not  
**[0:35:35-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:35):**  a central part of it and I think it is very different when you're an activist doing organising  or if it's a clearly political space as opposed to just someone who has a hobby and you know  like the fact that people cannot believe that there are other black growers even though  
**[0:35:52-0:36:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:35:52):**  you know there's so many people who are growing who are not white who are farmers across the  world.  Yeah I think it's really great to see how different people also see these labels of  
**[0:36:06-0:36:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:06):**  organic or permaculture or sustainable as like just these modern terms for ways of farming  and ways of working with the land that are older than these labels in a way.  Yeah I don't know why the norm for farming more broadly should be seen to be intensive  
**[0:36:25-0:36:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:25):**  agriculture when we've been farming in these other ways for so long and across the world.  And it's totally tied with colonialism and capitalism like you can't separate the two  like within like a lot of the colonies intensive farming was a way of making as much money  
**[0:36:44-0:37:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:36:44):**  as possible by having like the highest yields and harvest and so on and that was only made  possible through like a subjugated labour force whether they were enslaved or indentured  workers or even with you know the enclosures in Britain right like you take up more and  
**[0:37:02-0:37:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:02):**  more land so that you can have livestock farming rather than having a diverse farming practice  or whatever and I see like the connection is like this long line of like this one particular  way of growing food that you use scientific resources in order to maintain or support  
**[0:37:25-0:37:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:25):**  you know like it benefits people who own a lot of land it benefits the wealthiest as  opposed to like the person trying to like just feed themselves and their family and  this is why we can't separate the countryside from the urban spaces because through displacing  
**[0:37:42-0:38:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:37:42):**  people you create this landless wage labour force.  Yeah so just got to stop ranting about capitalism but like it's like inextricable to be if  we're talking about methods of farming and why they came about.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:00):**  Yeah never stop ranting.  I used to live out towards more of a rural kind of countryside area.  At first being in those spaces made me feel really uncomfortable and I couldn't quite  
**[0:38:21-0:38:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:21):**  put my finger on what it was for a while.  I remember kind of walking around those spaces and feeling like a bit of an intruder to be  honest and as though I as a person of colour didn't necessarily belong in those spaces  
**[0:38:40-0:38:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:40):**  because the majority of the people around that area and also that had monopoly on those  areas they were white and to come into that space from being an urban space where a lot  of the people around me looked like me and spoke like me to then walk among these fields  
**[0:38:58-0:39:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:38:58):**  and feel like oh this this doesn't feel like I associate farming with whiteness.  It has taken quite a long time to deconstruct that and to understand that I have just as  much claim and agency in these green spaces as anyone else.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:23):**  To some extent to feel at home here is to have a strong sort of social network to have  people around you that support you that affirm who you are and not always question you.  Where you can see some of yourself reflected around you, where you can see an affirmation  
**[0:39:49-0:40:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:39:49):**  of who you are, where you feel your skills are valued or that you're not constantly put  into a box as being different I suppose and that you don't have to prove yourself all  the time.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:05):**  I always felt that as somebody who was seen as different and not necessarily from here  I always had to authenticate that I actually knew about rural in some ways I almost had  to sort of say well you know I have lived on a craft we have established a business  
**[0:40:26-0:40:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:26):**  you know I've lived in rural areas I had to justify myself so it's to develop a sort of  context where people don't constantly have to think of themselves of the other.  People of colour and black people more generally we've never really felt welcomed in kind of  
**[0:40:43-0:40:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:43):**  rural quote unquote sort of wild spaces.  I'm speaking about it specifically around the UK but I know that this is obviously true  in the US and lots of other parts of the world as well where people in the global majority  
**[0:40:57-0:41:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:40:57):**  aren't usually recognised as belonging they're not recognised as being faces that you would  expect to see in green areas.  I like to use words just like green spaces because it just feels a little bit less loaded  
**[0:41:11-0:41:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:11):**  than things like rural or wild or any of these words that also I think probably have some  kind of colonial history and are just very human centric I guess.  We get to look at history we get to look at the botanists who did have the access to be  
**[0:41:29-0:41:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:29):**  able to study and explore these fields and again they failed to look like us and sometimes  that's down to structures that award privileges to certain communities but yeah it's sad that  botany and horticulture and just plants and non-human beings just connecting with anything  
**[0:41:52-0:42:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:41:52):**  is seen as something that should be commodified and made inaccessible.  They just keep it white dominated that's the truth.  It's awfully angular that may be a little politically incorrect but I think it's not  
**[0:42:10-0:42:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:10):**  to be rude or to demean anybody's experience but we all look around and I even have friends  within the white community that can honestly open up and say this space is not inclusive  this space tokenises a lot of individuals when it does award opportunities it would  
**[0:42:28-0:42:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:28):**  mature either caricature or experiences and actually allow us the room to grow and explore.  For me in my life now living in Edinburgh there's really like such a lack of like I  haven't found a community in Edinburgh of growers or like people interested in specifically  
**[0:42:51-0:43:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:42:51):**  talking about food growing or just like any kind of growing that isn't majority white  middle class that is just what it is there and I live with a lot of people and I'm around  a lot of people who are super into foraging and like tapping into traditional ways of  
**[0:43:08-0:43:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:08):**  growing and like connecting with nature and I feel like quite separate from that because  I just feel like yeah I just feel like it's a very white space and I think it's great  that there is a space of people doing that but I have a bit of a block with it.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:24):**  I always think like that's something that I'm so interested in like why am I not doing  it and I realised because it's totally about the community for me and I think it's just  I don't feel like it's a space that I am part of or like that is accessible to me or not  
**[0:43:41-0:43:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:41):**  even that it's like I would enjoy it a lot more if it was people that were like me you  know or that people that I could relate with and so I guess I would hope to find a way  to be a part of something like that so that I could learn more about growing and I could  
**[0:43:54-0:44:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:43:54):**  just be more active like implement it more into my life I think yeah so I hope I can  find that.  Yeah you will.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:02):**  Yeah I will yeah.  I think the more inwards I have been going and reconnecting with myself and my identity  as a brown person, a person of colour, I have been feeling more and more connected to the  
**[0:44:19-0:44:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:19):**  land and more and more as though it kind of is a part of my DNA.  My ancestors were from the land, they were brought up on the land, they used the land  and I guess like earth magic to nourish themselves and heal themselves and I want to be able  
**[0:44:45-0:45:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:44:45):**  to honour that and carry that forward also.  The last piece we're going to hear is a visioning piece from you Sam.  What was important to you in recording and sharing this?  
**[0:45:07-0:45:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:07):**  I think I wanted to record this piece because I want to try and imagine what is this world  that we are working towards.  I think so often within lefty activist spaces we're always like fighting against reacting  
**[0:45:23-0:45:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:23):**  against and it can often seem like the issue is like oh it's just about representation  especially around like identity-based politics and so on and I don't think it is just about  getting you know some like black or Asian or whatever students at your horticultural  
**[0:45:43-0:45:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:43):**  college or having more black landowners or farmers or even having like a queer boss,  I don't know, boss beekeeper.  You know like for me I'm just like how does this change?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:45:56):**  How can getting more queer folks and women and people of colour onto the land and into  land work, how can that actually work towards changing the structural experiences of marginalised  groups like these you know and how can it be also tied with climate justice and land  
**[0:46:22-0:46:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:22):**  justice and challenging the existing systems of oppression that mean that we feel so isolated  at times or so separate from the land.  I think a big part of this work is like just dreaming and imagining together and we need  
**[0:46:40-0:47:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:46:40):**  that because that's how we that's how we get change.  I think we're in this very difficult time in history where there's a lot of backlash  whenever we talk about rural racism or about queer identities within rural spaces because  
**[0:47:00-0:47:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:00):**  there is this attachment to the rural idyll which is this myth of an unchanging timeless  or out of time place which is just filled with like really friendly white people who  all know each other and have known each other for generations and it's sort of untouched  
**[0:47:22-0:47:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:22):**  by all of the degradation of urban spaces whether that is you know sex positivity or  like sexual diversity or you know racism and anti-racist movements and migration and different  cultures intermixing and at times maybe even coming into conflict with each other so there's  
**[0:47:48-0:48:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:47:48):**  like this idea that black and people of colour and queer people are relegated to the cities  and the city you can be around all of this really exciting diversity like these places  of change that is so much change constantly that you're struggling to keep up and rural  
**[0:48:05-0:48:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:05):**  spaces are like this escape this place where you can go to like restore yourself to heal  or you go when you can't handle living in a city anymore.  I think as a queer person and as a person of colour a black person I find it really  
**[0:48:22-0:48:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:22):**  heartbreaking at times because I can see how living in a city and in London it can be so  damaging to our health whether that's our mental health or our physical health like  you know we're living under an economic system that doesn't value people's health and well-being  
**[0:48:41-0:48:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:41):**  people living in the most deprived areas and usually urban areas are more likely to be  exposed to higher amounts of air pollution and are less likely to be able to access green  spaces and nature spaces and so on and you know it's just proven that these things are  
**[0:48:58-0:49:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:48:58):**  good for your physical health as well as your mental health.  There's like this one like why do people live here and like I think if you're a queer person  or a person of colour you know you're seeking community you're seeking somewhere that you  
**[0:49:09-0:49:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:09):**  can feel safe but also you experience a lot of structural discrimination that means if  you aren't able to assimilate and look and act and speak a certain way you have a lot  less opportunities available to you.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:23):**  Being able to like set up communities you know being able to live in rural spaces without  varying isolation or discrimination and you know it's one thing if like a nuclear family  unit goes and moves into this place or like whether they're queer or whether they're black  
**[0:49:42-0:49:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:42):**  or Asian or whatever you're always going to feel like an outsider and be a lot more exposed.  What would it be like if we could just go and live in a small town or village or set  up our own land projects but also still connect to the communities there because I think there's  
**[0:49:59-0:50:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:49:59):**  like this desire also from people who live in these areas to not feel like they're stuck  in the past and also to feel like they're not forgotten as well.  Is there a way that we can create a new way of being in the countryside and being on the  
**[0:50:14-0:50:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:14):**  land that doesn't feel like you're just living like this fantasy cottagecore existence but  actually is so much about creating a new way of being in rural spaces that feels as dynamic  and exciting and vital as when you're in the city but then rather than being driven by  
**[0:50:34-0:50:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:34):**  like the sense of urgency which I think can happen a lot with activist organising I think  it's important for us to actually think about what does it mean to set down roots and also  to do it in a way that is forging relationships with the people who have been there before.  
**[0:50:50-0:51:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:50:50):**  And I think the other side of it is not to think that a land and food justice movement  or climate justice movement has to be based in the countryside either.  I think there's ways that we could transform cities like London into being nourishing places  
**[0:51:06-0:51:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:06):**  for anyone to live in.  The fact is that so many people do grow up here or live here but then we don't feel like  a sense of ownership or ability to change the spaces we're in as much as we want to  
**[0:51:21-0:51:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:21):**  because of how controlled we are in these spaces.  How can that connection between the rural and the urban happen in a way that is really  transformative?  
**[0:51:33-0:51:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:33):**  How can we have less cars and more accessible affordable public transportation, more green  spaces and nature reserves within cities, more agro-ecological farming and mini forests  in cities, more green zones in between very residential areas, less pollution, more people  
**[0:51:57-0:52:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:51:57):**  being able to have beautiful spaces that they can rest and relax in, learn about food growing  or carpentry or other skills within these urban spaces so it's not just seeing that  you either live in a countryside or you live in a city.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:17):**  We've lost a lot of things.  We've lost the ability to have cheap or free housing or organizing spaces or just places  to rest and ways to rest and access healing therapies and so on.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:33):**  These are things that are hard to navigate on your own and that's why it's more and more  essential that we create the resources and the spaces that we need whether we are in  urban or rural spaces and that they are not this binary separate thing.  
**[0:52:48-0:53:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:52:48):**  They are connected and essential for us to actually create a transformative movement  you know and if we're talking about land justice, land justice implicates all the things that  you find in urban spaces too from housing to ideas about use of land and there's a lot  
**[0:53:07-0:53:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:07):**  of different things that land justice can mean also when we're thinking about cities.  It's about trying to tell a new story drawing on what we've learned from collective organizing,  what we learned from queer organizing, what we've learned from anti-racist organizing  
**[0:53:29-0:53:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:29):**  over the past centuries about you know how can we do it in a way that isn't just propping  up the state or heteronormative ways of living and working together.  What if we're not even paying attention to that, we tell our own stories, we share our  
**[0:53:47-0:54:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:53:47):**  own narratives, we archive our own organizing in its own ways that we just focus on like  building really solid foundations and relationships and communities so that we have a really resilient  movement.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:11):**  Thanks so much for listening to Cultivating Justice.  Cultivating Justice isn't just this podcast series, we've also made some zines and Sam  do you want to tell us a bit about those?  
**[0:54:21-0:54:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:21):**  Yeah so as we've talked about in previous episodes, Marcus published a zine called  Gourds, Banjers and Callaloo which you can read on Lion's website and you can order a  reprint as well from our store.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:34):**  We've also got a zine called Transplants made up of submissions from lots of different folks  looking at querying and decolonizing botany and yeah you can get that zine as well as  some merch like t-shirts, vests, caps, patches and so on all from Lion's website.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:54:55):**  The link will be in our show notes.  Queer vision of land justice means visibility really, visibility of queer bodies in the  landscape.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:21):**  You know, there's a lot of queer people who would like to or do currently do land based  work but there's a lot of people who feel excluded from that space, really, most often  but not entirely.  
**[0:55:45-0:56:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:55:45):**  Yeah so queer vision of land justice is simply just there being a non-judgmental safe space  for all queers to be in and take up space.  I just think everyone should be, in inverted commas I suppose, allowed, that everyone's  
**[0:56:04-0:56:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:04):**  allowed to be in nature.  Nature's for everyone.  I'm really talking from quite a privileged position where I can be, you know, out at  
**[0:56:16-0:56:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:16):**  work and get to where I want, which is nice.  It's not always been the case.  I think I'm really privileged in that way and globally like there's just really a lot  
**[0:56:33-0:57:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:56:33):**  of work to be done but I just really don't think that nature should be the place that  is just solely thought of as a, you know, white, cis, heteronormative, able bodied space.  I just think it should be there for people who are neurodivergent, people, all the people,  
**[0:57:05-0:57:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:05):**  because it's just really important for me, for my mental health and I think it really  would be for a lot of others.  For me, I suppose it's about access to the land for everyone but it's key that it's not  
**[0:57:22-0:57:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:22):**  just about that, it's also about changing cultures and attitudes which are no longer  relevant.  It's about moving away from extractive, short-term and selfish approaches towards a more inclusive  
**[0:57:36-0:58:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:57:36):**  world where everyone can flourish on a land which in itself is respected and valued as  the source of all our wellbeing and livelihoods.  So I'd just like to close this off by thanking everybody who followed.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:00):**  I hope I was somewhat cohesive.  I hope I've done some justice in amplifying something.  It's quite a struggle but I do think there's definitely a desire and a need for more representation  
**[0:58:14-0:58:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:14):**  and not just tokenistic representation but actual inclusive representation.  I know what that looks like and I think many individuals within this space know what that  looks like and they are facilitating the creation of it but it takes other individuals ensuring  
**[0:58:36-0:58:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:36):**  that we're not using these terminologies as a buzzword.  It takes people stepping up and having difficult conversations and listening.  I've told a fraction of my story and I hope that's given some insight, a vague insight  
**[0:58:52-0:59:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-6#t=0:58:52):**  into just a perspective but I know there's many other stories out there and listening  is probably the best thing that people can do.

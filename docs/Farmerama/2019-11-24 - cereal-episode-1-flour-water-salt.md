## 'Cereal', Episode 1: Flour, water, salt  
**[0:00:00-0:00:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:00):**  Would you like to do a dough?  
**[0:00:02-0:00:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:02):**  That would be great.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:03):**  Yeah, you sure?  
**[0:00:04-0:00:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:04):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:05):**  Have you got time?  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:06):**  I've got time.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:11):**  So, we're now going to put in 500 grams of flour.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:14):**  You want to be as accurate as you can, see.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:16):**  So, we've got our 500 grams of flour, right?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:00:19):**  10 grams of salt, which we'll pop in there.

**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:01:47):**  Acid.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:01:49):**  Bread.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:01:50):**  How did something so basic, so fundamental, get so complicated?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:01:58):**  How have the needs of industrial production come to dictate the way that seeds are bread,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:03):**  grain is grown, flour is milled, and bread is baked, and eaten?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:09):**  And what impact has that had on everyone involved?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:13):**  Over the course of this series, we'll be looking for answers to those questions.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:18):**  And we'll be meeting just a few of the many people who are imagining and building alternative models.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:26):**  Through these encounters, we'll be exploring the past, present, and possible futures of grain in the UK and beyond.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:36):**  Some of it might seem a bit niche, a bit esoteric.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:40):**  But believe me, if you eat food, you have a stake in this story.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:51):**  First though, why start with bread?  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:54):**  Well, not only is it a staple food, it has huge symbolic significance as well.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:02:59):**  Bread is a mainstay not just of meals, but of language.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:04):**  Bread and roses.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:05):**  The bread of life.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:06):**  My bread and butter.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:07):**  Living on the breadline.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:09):**  Our daily bread.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:10):**  Know which side your bread is buttered on.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:12):**  The breadwinner.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:13):**  Breaking bread together.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:16):**  The word companion literally means someone you share bread with.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:21):**  Bread is actually almost an emotional thing.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:24):**  Chris McCormack, a home baker also known as Govanhill Breadman.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:28):**  I have given bread to people and friends who just go, thanks Chris, or that's great.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:34):**  And then they phone you up and go, oh, I really enjoyed that, it was brilliant.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:37):**  And then I've given it to people who are coming to tears because you've given them a loaf of bread.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:43):**  So bread is a very, very special thing.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:47):**  But if you make it yourself and make it with love, it's even more special.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:53):**  And on a practical level, bread is a lens through which we can explore our food system more broadly.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:03:59):**  The radical changes that bread has undergone are revealing of much wider truths  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:04):**  about our relationships to food, to farmers, to the land, the environment and to each other.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:11):**  I think people have a very deep connection to bread.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:14):**  That's Kimberly Bell, founder of Small Food Bakery in Nottingham.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:18):**  And even if you don't know anything about farming, there's something incredibly powerful about standing in the middle of a wheat field just before it's harvested.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:25):**  We know that on some innate level.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:27):**  So although it's a massively devalued food, I think it was a good starting point for us to really look at the food system  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:34):**  and look at how we might do something differently or explore other ways of looking at it.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:41):**  I think bread is one of the foods that has been completely devalued by our monopoly food system.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:49):**  And we find ourselves in this bizarre situation where the staple foods that we rely on for most of our energy  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:55):**  have become very poor quality on the whole.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:04:58):**  And we spend most of our grocery money on things that you'd really probably deem luxuries  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:04):**  and the industry has convinced us that they're necessary.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:08):**  Bread is just one of the most perfect examples of that.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:11):**  And when you look at every single step of the chain, you realise that there's problems.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:16):**  There's missing value at every single step, whether it's at the bakery where shortcuts may be being taken  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:22):**  to try and sell people or market to people falsities.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:27):**  Right through to getting out on the arable farms and you suddenly realise we've got huge problems and mismatches of value  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:34):**  where the farmer just simply isn't getting enough money to cover the cost of production.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:39):**  I'm pretty sure that also bread's an interesting enough product.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:44):**  It has a kind of emotive value to it that does open people's eyes to thinking about these things.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:52):**  I think bread is a really interesting space to start from because it's something that everybody has experience of.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:05:58):**  Chelsea Marshall from Scotland the Bread.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:01):**  It's such an important part of our just ordinary natural cuisine in our lives here in Scotland and across Europe and North America.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:09):**  But we don't see where it comes from.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:12):**  It's different than growing carrots in your back garden or starting a little tiny plot of cherry tomatoes.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:17):**  Very, very few people have actually seen cereals grow in their own spaces and places  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:23):**  and understand or tend to think about or are encouraged to think about where that comes from.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:28):**  In some ways that's what makes all of the problems with our bread supply easier to hide.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:34):**  It's not as natural for people to understand or see that whole process take place.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:39):**  But the problem I would describe is that generally people are quite unhappy with the system.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:45):**  And I think if you just take that as a base point there are many different strands,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:49):**  you know, many different wormholes you could go down to explore how that unhappiness manifests itself.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:06:56):**  But whether people are aware of it or not I'm pretty sure there isn't very many people out there who are happy with the current food system.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:05):**  Farmers are certainly not getting a good deal and I think not many people realise that, for example,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:11):**  the rate of farmer suicides in this country is higher than it's ever been.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:17):**  I think it's an incredibly challenging job.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:21):**  It's a very sacred position to hold in our society and currently it's one that our society doesn't hold as being sacred.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:28):**  And so there's this huge mismatch basically of values.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:32):**  It's worth noting that small food, like the other bakeries we'll hear about, is rather more than a bakery.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:39):**  It's also an engine of change, a pioneer in re-humanising food systems,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:44):**  rebuilding direct relationships between consumers and bakers, bakers and farmers, farmers and millers.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:51):**  We'll be hearing more about their work, and their bread, later in the series.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:56):**  For now, back to Kim.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:07:58):**  The way I saw it and still see it in the beginning was that the supermarkets have got this kind of collective monopoly hold over us.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:08):**  97% of all of our food retailers bought through supermarket systems.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:13):**  And I think there's this myth in the UK particularly that we have freedom of choice, that the supermarkets are providing us with choice.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:21):**  But it's my belief that they're not providing us with any choice at all and they're actually providing us with a very one-dimensional offer,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:29):**  which has some positives, but for me the negatives completely outweigh any positives that they're able to provide.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:36):**  What I've really come to understand or come to believe through my investigations with Small Food Bakery  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:44):**  is that the system that we build to deliver our food actually ends up dictating the cuisine that we have.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:51):**  The cuisine that we have is pretty influential in terms of people's health, both physical and mental.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:08:58):**  It's a truism to say that everything's connected to everything.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:01):**  Andrew Whitley, co-founder of the Real Bread campaign and Scotland the Bread.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:06):**  Certainly in bread terms, you can see how you can go from a big issue such as a society afflicted by increasing levels of mental ill health  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:15):**  and the nature of the genetics of the plants that are being grown for that bread and the industrial system,  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:21):**  which is closing its eyes to all the little steps it takes in the service of shareholder profit, it has to be said,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:29):**  to make that effectively as disagreeable as possible to its consumers.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:35):**  Which brings us to an important question. Here's Theo Lafargue from Riverside Bakery in Stirling.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:41):**  It's completely possible to make bread that is digestible, tasty, ecologically sound, sustainable,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:49):**  only using three simple ingredients, flour, water and salt. Why wouldn't we make real bread?  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:09:55):**  I mean in simple terms it's about taking shortcuts which at the time seem reasonable and sensible  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:02):**  if your main objective is to make more bread per hour with fewer people and at the lowest possible price.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:10):**  If that is your objective then the current system has been spectacularly successful.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:15):**  It's just that it's become increasingly less popular with the very consumers it's supposed to be serving  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:21):**  for one simple reason that it doesn't agree with their guts.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:24):**  Increasing numbers of people are cutting gluten out of their diets.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:28):**  Gluten being a group of proteins found in wheat as well as other grains like rye, spelt and barley.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:34):**  12% of people in the UK now say they follow a gluten-free diet.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:39):**  There's been an explosion in bread marketed as free-from.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:43):**  Around 1% of the population is thought to suffer from celiac disease,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:48):**  an autoimmune condition where gluten causes the body's immune system to attack itself.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:52):**  And wheat allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:10:57):**  But beyond that there's a much larger group of people who seem to have some other kind of sensitivity or reaction to wheat,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:05):**  from mild bloating to serious pain.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:08):**  From being the cornerstone of our diets it seems that for many people bread has become at best a guilty indulgence  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:15):**  or at worst something to be completely avoided.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:19):**  It's just taken a long time to suggest that there's an alternative which involves a wholesale,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:24):**  a radical rethink of the industrial method, which is where we come to artisan or small-scale baking.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:31):**  And the thing that defines that is above all, apart from a more human-facing choice of raw materials  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:37):**  and an absence of additives, is actually this question of fermentation.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:41):**  Fermentation, the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts or other microorganisms.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:48):**  In this case the fermentation of flour by wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:53):**  which is what happens in sourdough baking.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:11:56):**  In some ways, fermentation means the process of digestion starts before we eat.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:01):**  We know now that's the thing, the secret key.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:04):**  It increases digestibility, what's called bioavailability or bioaccessibility of the minerals that are in the flour.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:13):**  For instance, industrial wholemeal is not fermented so the phytic acid,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:18):**  which is a natural component of the bran of whole grain cereals which will be in there,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:24):**  locks up the calcium and magnesium and things like that to a considerable extent  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:29):**  so that although they're sort of on the label as being potential nutritional components,  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:34):**  they don't actually become available to your body.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:36):**  So fermentation allows certain components of the grain that we can't easily digest to become more digestible.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:43):**  And it also unlocks nutrients that our bodies can't otherwise make use of.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:48):**  In other words, just because a nutrient is present in a food, like a loaf of bread,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:53):**  that doesn't necessarily mean it's in a form your body can access and make use of.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:12:58):**  But you're never told that, so you think you're doing something healthy  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:01):**  by eating a wholemeal bread from a big manufacturer in a sliced brick form.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:06):**  Actually, it would be very instructive if the manufacturers were forced to say  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:10):**  how much of that was actually available to your body,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:13):**  because otherwise it's a fiction and it's a misleading fiction.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:16):**  So how did we get here?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:18):**  It's a long, complicated and contentious story.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:21):**  Too long to recount in full here.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:24):**  But it's important to remember that at every step in the process, there was some kind of logic.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:30):**  It's only when all those steps are considered together  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:33):**  that our current bread system's illogic, its utter dysfunction, becomes clear.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:39):**  It's a story Andrew Whitley has spent many years piecing together.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:43):**  Back in 1976, he set up a small bakery in Cumbria,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:47):**  where he started baking wholemeal loaves with stone-ground flour from a local watermill.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:52):**  At the time, a fairly wacky venture.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:13:55):**  And then in the late 1980s, he was spurred to embark on a research journey that continues to this day.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:02):**  I'd had a long history of my own customers coming to me and saying,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:06):**  can you explain to me why I can eat your bread without any ill effects,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:10):**  but I can't eat so-called shop bread?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:13):**  And it was really trying to understand the biochemistry of that,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:16):**  which led me into realising how complicated that is for a non-scientist anyway,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:22):**  and also how many tendrils it sends out in all kinds of directions  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:27):**  connected with the supply of grain, geopolitics,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:30):**  globalisation, imperialism, you know, all that kind of thing.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:34):**  At this point, we could trace the story back as far as we want,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:38):**  thousands or even tens of thousands of years.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:41):**  But for now, let's skip back a few centuries  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:44):**  to a point in relatively recent British history  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:47):**  when there was a shift away from growing wheat suitable for making bread  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:51):**  towards importing bread-making wheat from abroad.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:54):**  In other words...  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:55):**  What one might call Globalisation Mark I,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:14:58):**  which was the gradual appearance from the late 18th century onwards  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:03):**  of harder grains coming in from cheap sources in Russia initially,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:08):**  and then later Argentina and the New World when it was opened up.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:13):**  When it comes to wheat, hard means high in protein, including gluten.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:18):**  Soft wheat contains less gluten.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:20):**  Generally speaking, it's easier to make bread with harder, higher gluten wheat.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:25):**  In any case, the wheat British farmers had been growing domestically  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:30):**  was softer than the wheat now being imported from abroad.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:33):**  The fascinating thing is that this was an example of something  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:36):**  that we see nowadays in other sectors,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:38):**  where very poor people are growing crops in conditions of exploitation.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:43):**  Remember that the Russians had serfdom until 1861,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:47):**  so if we're talking about 1800,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:49):**  shiploads of grain coming down, filled by peasant carts coming down to Odessa,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:55):**  drawn by horses, having been harvested completely by hand,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:15:59):**  filling the clippers coming from Odessa round to Liverpool and London  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:04):**  to feed the urban working class of Britain.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:07):**  And obviously it had an effect on the famous dispute  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:11):**  between the manufacturers and landowners over the Corn Laws,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:14):**  which were essentially a protectionist measure  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:16):**  to stop the importation of grain when there was a glut,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:19):**  so that the local producers still could sell their grain at a reasonable price.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:24):**  The battle was won in those days by the manufacturers,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:27):**  who essentially wanted to be able to bring in cheaper grain  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:31):**  so that they didn't have to pay their workers so much,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:34):**  just above starvation wages,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:36):**  so that they could then sell their manufacturers abroad at competitive prices,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:40):**  and so the thing went on.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:42):**  And for the first industrialised country this was a massively important issue,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:46):**  because it's all about competitive advantage.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:49):**  But the effect of that, when you look at it in the social realm,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:52):**  is that people coming off the land, being forced off the land,  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:55):**  with their houses or huts being destroyed behind them more or less,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:16:59):**  to populate the tenements of Bradford, Halifax and Leeds and places,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:05):**  to work in mills, they didn't have the ability to provide themselves  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:09):**  with basic foods any more, they certainly couldn't grow any,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:13):**  and they didn't have much access to markets with fresh fruit and vegetables and so on,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:17):**  and they didn't have any kitchens to cook,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:20):**  so they fell back on the first convenience food, which was industrial bread.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:24):**  So there was a massive pressure to increase the production of cheap bread.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:29):**  But then, war.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:31):**  Relying on imported grains to make bread was no longer viable,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:35):**  but by now the system had been built around those imported grains.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:39):**  Britain's milling and baking infrastructure was not suited to using home-grown wheat.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:44):**  The attempt to reverse the importation of grain because it was so expensive  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:48):**  in a country that was bankrupt after the war was really important economically,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:52):**  but local farmers didn't have the varieties that would suit the technology  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:17:57):**  that had developed to make bread from imported grains.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:01):**  So they squared that circle by the use of high-speed mixing and additives.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:07):**  Initially, potassium bromate, azodicarbonamide chemical additives,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:10):**  which had an effect of strengthening the gluten in locally grown wheats.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:14):**  And that's just one strand following the logic of changes in variety and source of wheat,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:20):**  feeding through to a change in technology and a change in bread-making method,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:24):**  which then gathered speed in the 1960s with the Chorley Wood bread process.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:29):**  Chorley Wood.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:30):**  Whether or not you've heard of it, you've almost definitely eaten its products.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:34):**  The technique was invented in 1961,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:37):**  and it allowed lower protein, or softer wheats, to be used to make bread.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:41):**  The Chorley Wood bread process essentially is a way of taking flour, water, yeast and additives  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:48):**  and mixing it extremely quickly in very high-speed mixers,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:51):**  which put in a large amount of energy very quickly, sort of whipping almost,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:55):**  rather than slow mixing of dough, such as one would do at home.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:18:59):**  And the combination of the chemistry and the energy input means that the resulting dough  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:06):**  forms a gluten structure which can capture little bubbles of gas from the yeast fermentation  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:14):**  and rise into a very, very even structure, which is very close so that there are no holes in the bread  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:19):**  when you cut it because you don't want holes in a sandwich or toast or whatever.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:24):**  And yet it's very, very light, so it expands enormously.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:28):**  And that's really the name of the game.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:30):**  So, maximum expansion of the dough in the minimum time. Why is that significant?  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:36):**  The key sort of way in which that is translated into industrial efficiency or output per person  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:43):**  is by reducing to virtually zero the actual time of fermentation.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:49):**  Now, clearly some fermentation has to happen because yeast's function in a dough is to turn sugars  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:55):**  derived from the starches in the flour into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:19:59):**  Carbon dioxide is the gas that aerates the bread.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:02):**  So that's got to happen, but in Chorley Wood it happens almost entirely in the rising in the tin,  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:07):**  which is something that they haven't succeeded in speeding up to no time at all.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:11):**  But the stage which always used to take the majority of time, which was fermentation of the dough,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:16):**  not just to develop the gluten structure so that it would trap lots of gas and make a light loaf,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:23):**  but also to develop a flavour, a roundness, a kind of ripeness of the dough that bakers used to talk about.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:29):**  So it rises in the tin really quickly and then is baked.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:33):**  And the biggest chunk of time, believe it or not, in the whole baking process from flour to wrap loaf  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:39):**  is in the cooling of the loaf so that you can slice it because you can't slice the bread until it's cool,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:44):**  otherwise it gunges up the slicer, which is in a sense an incredible demonstration of industrial possibility.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:20:52):**  There's no inherent reason other than chasing low price and convenience understood as a kind of indefinite shelf life  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:01):**  conferred by preservatives and crumb softening enzymes, which are a relatively new thing,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:07):**  which mean that the texture of the loaf doesn't change from day to day, week to week, after baking.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:12):**  There's no time in human history when people have eaten food that doesn't actually age in a natural way  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:17):**  because it's been chemically arrested, a kind of Peter Pan bread I call it really,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:23):**  because it stays permanently young, but it's a fairly strange kind of youth that is conferred by these crumb softening enzymes.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:31):**  So Chorley Wood allows us to skip the long fermentation process that was previously necessary.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:37):**  The result? More loaves, more quickly, with far less human input.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:42):**  And it seems that more and more people are finding that they can't stomach it.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:46):**  We're now understanding the depth of that disagreement between the raw materials and the process and the guts.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:53):**  And there isn't a silver bullet, we can't just sort of say, oh we need a bit of gene editing of the wheat to change this,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:21:58):**  or we need to stick a bit of dried sourdough powder into our bread and call it sourdough,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:03):**  which is what the large manufacturers are doing now, which is a scandalous theft of intellectual property really  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:09):**  from the real bakers who have discovered in practice and taken the trouble to hone the skills,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:15):**  which show that long fermentation with sourdough lactic acid bacteria is one of those traditional steps in baking  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:23):**  that human beings have been practising without really understanding what they were doing necessarily for thousands of years.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:30):**  And it's vitally important to detoxifying aspects of wheat that disagree with certain people,  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:36):**  but also in opening up the wheat or rye or barley or whatever it is,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:42):**  to enable the human body to benefit from the nutritional components that are in there,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:48):**  and crucially to stimulate that diversity in the gut which we're now seeing as important to both digestive health  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:22:55):**  and interestingly and significantly to mental health as well.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:00):**  There's a growing body of scientific research into the way our guts and our brains interact,  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:06):**  including evidence that our gut microbes communicate with our nervous system by producing neurotransmitters,  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:12):**  chemicals that play a crucial role in our mental health.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:16):**  The impact of fermented foods such as sourdough is an area of particular interest.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:22):**  Basically, gut feeling isn't a figure of speech. Our bodies are intricate systems.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:28):**  It stands to reason that what we eat affects how we function mentally, how we think and how we feel.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:35):**  Okay, so we've got a taste of what's wrong with industrial bread. What's the alternative?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:41):**  Andrew Whitley refers to it as real bread.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:44):**  There are several key differences between Charliewood processed bread,  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:47):**  which is essentially the industrial bread that 80 to 90 percent of the market is supplied with in the UK at the moment,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:54):**  and so-called artisan bread or real bread.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:23:58):**  The real bread campaign standard is simply flour, water, yeast and salt and no additives or processing aids,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:05):**  which is a technical definition of things which are normally not even mentioned on the label,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:09):**  but which are put into the production process.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:12):**  These additives are meticulously listed in Bread Matters, Andrew Whitley's book, which was published in 2009.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:19):**  Bread Matters started out as a kind of recipe book for home bakers.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:23):**  What it became was a far-reaching biography of bread, as well as a manifesto and a call to action.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:30):**  It lifted the curtain on what goes into the bread most of us eat every day.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:35):**  I published in the book tables of the additives that went into bread and the likely effects  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:39):**  and the possible criticisms of why they might not be very good to eat and so on.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:44):**  And when I was promoting the book and talking to various groups around the country,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:48):**  people said, do you know, we didn't really realise it was as bad as this.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:51):**  What are we going to do about it? And there was a sort of general murmuring about why don't we start a campaign?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:24:57):**  Andrew took the idea to Sustain, a charity which describes itself as an alliance for better food and farming.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:03):**  And so the real bread campaign was launched.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:06):**  First of all, it established a very simple definition of real bread, which was bread made without additives.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:12):**  And although that wasn't everything that I meant by real bread, and I had a sort of series of criteria,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:19):**  which luckily I think and rightly Sustain said, it might be better to leave it a little bit wider to start with,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:25):**  and then we can gradually encourage people to up their game, as it were, towards, you know,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:29):**  choosing grain for nutritional quality or organic growing or long fermentation, specifically with sourdough.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:36):**  All of those things are very much recommended and listed in the real bread campaign's criteria,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:42):**  but they aren't a minimum requirement.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:44):**  So we're trying to encourage people to kind of get off the additives first.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:49):**  And when you bake without additives, it almost pushes you anyway into thinking much more about fermentation,  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:25:55):**  because things like gluten development and handling the dough are so much easier if you do it in a long process,  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:02):**  rather than trying to mimic Chorley Wood with a very short fermentation, lots of yeast and no time.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:09):**  And so certain connections, possible domino effects, start to become apparent.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:15):**  A change in one part of the food system can ultimately ripple right across it.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:20):**  For example, baking or eating real bread, and perhaps especially sourdough, encourages or maybe even forces you  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:27):**  into a closer relationship with its ingredients.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:30):**  And that closer relationship might lead to questions about where those ingredients come from,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:35):**  how they were processed, who grew them, under what conditions and at what scale,  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:41):**  as well as how the way those ingredients are transformed into bread will affect the people who eat it.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:46):**  That's the difference between artisan bread and industrial bread,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:50):**  that one is trying to do its very best using human skill and patience to nourish healthy people.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:26:58):**  The other is trying to make profits out of selling a thing which we call bread.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:27:05):**  It'll become clear in future episodes that the way we make our bread, or as consumers,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:27:10):**  the kind of bread we choose to buy, has a huge trickle-down effect all the way back along the production chain.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-1-flour-water-salt#t=0:27:17):**  In the next episode, we'll go back to the start of that chain, to the seed.

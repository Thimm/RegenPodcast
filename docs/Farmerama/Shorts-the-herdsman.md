**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:00):**  Here's storyteller Georgia Wingfield-Hayes sharing a piece called The Herdsman. It tells  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:08):**  the true story of Charles Ellett. He's now a happy herdsman at the ethical dairy, but  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:14):**  he previously worked at an intensive dairy farm with 1,500 cows, where his mental health  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:20):**  crashed.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:22):**  Through Charles' story we learn what cheap food is doing to the land, the animals, and  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:26):**  the people involved in its production.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:34):**  I'm standing in a great big shed, open to the elements on three sides. It's December  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:41):**  and an icy wind is blowing in off the Irish Sea. There's a faint smell of cow dung and  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:46):**  a strong smell of silage, and cows are all around, quiet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:53):**  The nearest us a calf suckles its mother and she, eyes half closed, licks the little one's  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:00:59):**  rump.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:00):**  We're being shown around the ethical dairy by one of the owners, David, Barry the stockman,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:05):**  and Charles the herdsman. There's something very unusual about these three men. I'm struck  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:12):**  by how happy and contented they are, and passionate about what they do. It's like the cows and  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:18):**  they are in this together. At the ethical dairy, calves stay with their mothers, which  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:24):**  forfeits some of the yield. To make up for this loss of revenue, they sell the naturally  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:29):**  reared 10-month-old male calves as Ruby Veal. This is Charles' first winter back at the  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:35):**  ethical dairy as herdsman. For the previous four years, he's worked at another much bigger,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:41):**  intensive dairy farm. Economic forces have driven farmers to either specialise into high-end  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:48):**  markets or greatly intensify to compete on the general market. That is to say, the supermarket  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:01:55):**  battleground to provide consumers with cheap food. Charles worked at one such flagship  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:02):**  intensive farm where over a thousand cows are milked three times a day. Here at the  
**[0:02:09-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:09):**  ethical dairy, a specialist farm, just 120 cows are milked. It's very peaceful here in  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:16):**  the barn. The cows look healthy and content. One has come up to us, sniffing over the wall,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:24):**  curious about this group of talkative people. Whilst the calves hear a little, their mothers  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:29):**  are milked just once a day in the morning. When the calves are a couple of months old,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:33):**  they'll be separated from their mums at night. Then at five months, weaned, after which the  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:39):**  cows will be milked twice a day. They like routine, Charles says. They preferred if I  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:46):**  wear a green jumper when I milk. If I wear this blue one, they kick more. Working at  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:51):**  the intensive dairy taught Charles a lot about being a good herdsman. His days there were  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:02:56):**  spent caring for the cows, trimming feet, injecting antibiotics, checking who was in  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:02):**  heat so they could be inseminated once again. And if they weren't back in Eastchester in  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:06):**  80 days, then he'd inject them with a 10 day fertility treatment. In the summer, these  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:14):**  cows around us will be out in the fields. In an intensive system, that's just not possible.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:22):**  So with the application of chemical fertilisers and slurry, the land produces four cuts of  
**[0:03:28-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:28):**  silage a year. Four silage cuts, three milking slots, two days off. As the cows around us  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:39):**  quietly feed, suckle their calves or rest in bed bays, David and Barry tell us of the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:45):**  immensely difficult journey they've taken to realise the vision of the ethical dairy.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:50):**  The first time we trialled leaving the calves with their mothers, it was an utter disaster,  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:03:54):**  David tells me. We were only getting about 10% of our previous milk yield. The cows just  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:01):**  weren't letting the milk down. It was like every time we took them to be milked, they  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:04):**  thought they wouldn't see their calves again. You see, normally on a dairy farm, a cow will  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:10):**  give birth and within 24 hours, she'll be taken to be milked and not see her calf again.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:17):**  At the intensive farm where Charles worked, the calves, if female, were then bucket fed.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:23):**  When I first started working there, Charles tells me, the male newborns were shot. But  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:29):**  then we found a neighbouring pig farmer who now takes them and grows them on for the beef  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:33):**  industry. In Charles's fourth year at the intensive dairy, his health started to falter.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:40):**  The schedule of 12 hour days, 12 days on, two days off, started to take their toll.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:48):**  I was so exhausted on my days off, I didn't have much energy for my kids, he tells me.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:54):**  If a colleague went off sick or something went wrong with the parlour, I could end up  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:04:58):**  doing an 18 hour day. You see, it takes four to five hours to milk 1000 plus cows. So the  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:05):**  first milking would start at five in the morning and the third would end at one in the morning.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:11):**  But if the parlour broke down, then that could all go awry. That was the most stressful thing  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:17):**  that could happen, recalls Charles. You can't turn hundreds of cows around, so they have  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:23):**  to wait in the system while you fix things. Occasionally one would collapse with the stress.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:28):**  And if you couldn't get her to a feet, we'd have to bring the load around and pick her  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:32):**  up with the bucket. It got depressing, having to pick a cow up off the floor who'd gone  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:37):**  down, spent. I'd feel like I'd failed her. How long do cows live in a system like that?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:44):**  I ask. Six, seven years max. They die of exhaustion generally, an infection like mastitis or pneumonia  
**[0:05:53-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:05:53):**  gets them. And how old's the oldest cow here? I ask, looking around. See that one, right  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:02):**  over there in the corner? She's 17. Most of the others are somewhere between six and 15  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:10):**  years old. Here at the ethical dairy, milk yields improve each year as the cows trust  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:16):**  and understand the new system. The whole thing depends a lot on the social stability of the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:22):**  herd, interjects David. They learn from their mothers, aunties and grandmothers. Now the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:28):**  cows know the system, they cooperate. The dairy's built on a kind of mutual respect  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:33):**  between cows and people. Barry tells me how one summer there was a cow who refused to  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:39):**  leave the field. She turned and led them over the hill to where her adult daughter was lying  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:45):**  sick. They wouldn't have known she was there had her mother not been so insistent. Four  
**[0:06:52-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:06:52):**  silage cuts, three milking slots, two days off. In the summer of 2017, Charles' health  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:04):**  crashed. He was on holiday and realised how much he didn't want to go back to work at the  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:10):**  intensive farm. He then developed acid reflux and when he went to the doctor, he collapsed  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:16):**  in tears. Depression was diagnosed. A couple of months on, the doctor became concerned  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:24):**  that the acid reflux might be cancer. Charles recalls, I really didn't care if it was cancer  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:32):**  because I knew at least then I wouldn't have to go back to work. Charles rubs the forelock  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:38):**  of another cow who's come up to us, inquisitive. It's nice to feel connected to the cows,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:44):**  he says. It's like they want that connection too. How did the cows interact with people  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:50):**  on the intensive farm, I ask? With fear, generally. They felt threatened, like they were thinking,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:07:57):**  what do you want from me next? Four silage cuts, three milking slots, two days off. At  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:08):**  the ethical dairy, they farm to organic standards. David tells me how it took five years for  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:14):**  the land to turn around from its dependency on chemical inputs to the life returning to  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:19):**  the soil and with it, natural fertility. This combined with reduced animal stress means  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:26):**  their antibiotic use is just 10% of pre-organic levels. The most important thing is stress,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:33):**  says Charles. Stress on people and animals. Animals that are sick but not under stress  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:39):**  recover so much more quickly. It's the same with people. Back then, apart from my mum  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:45):**  and my wife, it was the vet and the knackerman I had on speed dial. Four silage cuts, three  
**[0:08:53-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:08:53):**  milking slots, two days off. Charles finally left the intensive dairy farm. My dog saved  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:09:01):**  my life, he recalls. He got me out the house and connecting with people again. Farms are  
**[0:09:07-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:09:07):**  hard places to be. It can be a very isolated life. Four silage cuts, three milking slots,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:09:17):**  two days off. It's early morning, spring. The birds are singing in the dawn and Charles  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:09:27):**  Ellett, the herdsman, walks among the ethical dairy herd, touching the rump of each cow  
**[0:09:33-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-the-herdsman#t=0:09:33):**  as he passes. Morning, girls, he says.

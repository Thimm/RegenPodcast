**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:21):**  media and how the two are becoming ever closer. We head to a medicinal CSA, then we end with  
**[0:00:28-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:28):**  a technology that may be part of our toolkit for a regenerative future.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:36):**  Jonathan Nunn is editor of Vittles, a food newsletter that particularly features writers  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:41):**  and subjects not given space in traditional food writing. He talks us through setting  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:45):**  up Vittles in 2020 and tells us about how his attendance at a meeting of farmers just  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:50):**  outside London was inspiration for a season of the newsletter focusing on food production  
**[0:00:55-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:00:55):**  and producers. At the time, I think things were very, very  
**[0:01:04-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:04):**  unclear and lots of chefs were out of work. Lots of people within the food industry were  
**[0:01:12-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:12):**  suddenly not working. And my idea at the time was actually sort of focused around the lack  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:20):**  of clarity about things. I had ideas about sort of platforming chefs who were out of  
**[0:01:25-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:25):**  work and doing recipes and having writers talk about produce shops in London. And I  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:33):**  also had the vague idea that like myself when I started writing, that there would be a lot  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:40):**  of people who were thinking about food writing but never kind of made the step into doing  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:47):**  it. And so I had quite a small idea for like almost like this kind of London community  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:01:53):**  newsletter. And I think very quickly it turned into something bigger. There seemed to be  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:00):**  much more for demand for it than I kind of thought there would be. And what I realized  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:05):**  was that when I started writing, which was a few years ago, I was mainly writing about  
**[0:02:10-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:10):**  restaurants, actually exclusively about restaurants. And I started writing because I felt I wasn't  
**[0:02:19-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:19):**  seeing the London I knew and the London restaurant scene that I knew, which is mainly diasporic  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:27):**  restaurants represented within the mainstream of British food media, even though British  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:32):**  food media is so London centric. I don't think I quite realized it, but I think what came  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:37):**  up when I started Vittles is that within food writing, there are all these various different  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:42):**  sectors. So restaurant writing being one of them, there's recipe writing, of course, there's  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:47):**  agricultural writing. And it turned out that I think people had the same feeling with their  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:02:55):**  own sectors. And suddenly Vittles became this space where I guess lots of these aspects  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:03):**  of food writing, which have been quite disparate to each other could kind of interact and where  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:10):**  people could produce the writing which they kind of always wanted to write about what  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:15):**  they know. And so that kind of means connecting a lot of different worlds, which my editor  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:21):**  at The Guardian one day said, there's this festival called groundswell, which I think  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:26):**  you'll be really interested in. And so I went up and it was a really incredible experience  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:33):**  that there were farmers from all over the UK there. And all of them, either already  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:39):**  heavily interested in regenerative agriculture, or people who kind of heard about it and wanted  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:46):**  to know more. And I think by day two, I was struck by the fact that I hadn't bumped into  
**[0:03:54-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:03:54):**  a food writer. The entire time I'd been there. I was struck by a kind of conference that  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:03):**  revolves around the very basis of food on agriculture. There could be nothing more related  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:11):**  to food than that, that it wasn't being covered. And I don't say this to say that I'm somehow  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:18):**  better for being there. And I wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for sort of a kind  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:22):**  of stroke of luck. And by yeah, by the second day, I realized that there was clearly also  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:28):**  a blind spot in my own understanding of things. I was quite enjoying being the least knowledgeable  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:33):**  person in the room at any given point. And also maybe a blind spot in Bittles itself.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:40):**  And I thought it'd be a good challenge to make season five all about food production  
**[0:04:44-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:44):**  and producers. I thought it would be a useful thing to sort of connect the back end of production  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:04:55):**  with I guess the writing that Bittles has been doing for the last sort of one and a  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:00):**  half years and do it in a way which connects food production to a lot of the other topics  
**[0:05:06-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:06):**  which Bittles has been covering. The problem I came up with is that I think the way agriculture  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:14):**  can be written about can be quite academic and dry. And it's often being written for  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:20):**  other people within the industry who understand technical terms. A lot of it is like incredible  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:29):**  academic work, but it's not necessarily for sort of mass consumption. And for me, the  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:38):**  first thing that an article on Bittles has to do is kind of capture the reader. And Bittles  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:46):**  is a newsletter. And if the reader hasn't been kind of captured by the first paragraph,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:52):**  they're not really going to read on. So I think that's been my challenge from an editorial  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:05:59):**  point of view to make sure that the reader is even the casual reader, well, the food,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:05):**  the casual reader, but also even the food obsessed reader who might not really be interested  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:10):**  in issues of production, who might be interested more in consumption to make sure that reader  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:15):**  comes with the writer. I think if you ask most people what food writing is, they would  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:22):**  either point to the restaurant review or recipe writing or kind of a sort of more frivolous  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:30):**  type of lifestyle journalism. Most of those things center around the consumption of food.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:36):**  And production has always been a part of food writing. I mean, I'd go as far as to say that  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:44):**  the oldest piece of food writing I know would be something like Virgil's Georgics. And that  
**[0:06:47-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:47):**  is all about food production. But I think a lot of issues at the moment are making food  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:06:56):**  production a much more influential force in food writing. I think climate change, the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:01):**  discourse around regenerative agriculture, our consumption of meat and the way that veganism  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:08):**  is becoming a much more widespread thing. I think issues about labor are all playing  
**[0:07:15-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:15):**  into this as well. So I see the future of food writing is going to be much more focused  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:25):**  on production and agriculture than it is now. I think there's certainly an increase in desire  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:30):**  from the general public for this kind of writing. But I also think there's a demand for more  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:38):**  from farmers themselves to see the issues that they live every day to be represented  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:43):**  more in the mainstream of what we consider food writing. And in that sense, they're very  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:48):**  similar to, I guess, my feelings when I started writing about food is that what I wanted to  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:07:54):**  see was, were the issues that I and the world that I kind of lived every day represented  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:00):**  more. So in that sense, it feels like quite a similar thing. One thing I've learned from,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:08):**  I guess, publications like Farmerama and others is that farmers themselves are often much  
**[0:08:14-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:14):**  more articulate about the issues that the world faces, and which agriculture faces,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:22):**  and therefore, which the entire food system faces than food writers often are. Personally,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:30):**  I would like to see more farmers within food writing spaces, because I feel what happens  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:39):**  most of the time is that you get a writer who kind of, someone like me who doesn't know  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:46):**  what the real issues actually are, sort of coming in and writing about them. I would  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:51):**  say that one thing I've learned from editing a publication is that I do believe that anyone  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:08:58):**  can write something extremely interesting as long as they have an interesting perspective,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:04):**  and that being a technically good writer actually counts for very little in the grand scheme  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:08):**  of things. So as long as you have something meaningful to say, I think it always comes  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:13):**  through. So I would like to see more farmers writing about things. And every time I do  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:19):**  see a farmer writing about something, it's always fascinating.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:26):**  The Earth Light Herbs Co-operative is a medicinal herb farm, a pothecary and plant nursery that  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:32):**  began growing on an acre of land last year. We get introduced to the farm from Tiffany  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:37):**  Landemore, one of the founding members. She talks to us about how they made use of online

**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:09:59):**  this year. I've never grown it and I've never processed it before, but it's such a beautiful  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:04):**  plant. It was really easy to grow from seed, which is always a bonus in my eyes. When I  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:10):**  planted it out, it hardly got any slug damage. And then it grew really quickly. It's this  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:17):**  wonderful sort of vibrant green colour in the leaves, and then this bright, bright purple  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:21):**  flower. And the bees just go crazy for it. And it's sort of a really appropriate herb  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:28):**  for this time that we're sort of experiencing on planet Earth at the moment, because it  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:33):**  supports the respiratory system. So it's really useful in things like viruses, coughs, colds,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:39):**  an ancient herb as well. I think it's mentioned in the Bible.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:42):**  So we were looking at different ways of producing revenue. We were looking at sort of producing  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:48):**  our own remedies and thinking about how that's going to be sort of financially viable because  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:54):**  of the time and effort that goes into not only the growing, but also the processing  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:10:58):**  and signing the labels and then packing and posting. And it seemed like a CSA model was  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:04):**  sort of our best bet really in terms of making it financially viable. But also really the  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:09):**  main point was that we wanted to create a community. And the whole point of a CSA is  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:14):**  community supported agriculture. And we have been successful in creating a small little  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:18):**  community here. And it's growing daily. And it's really exciting to get to know local  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:23):**  people and connect with people also nationally, but focusing really on the local area around  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:28):**  Somerset to try and really empower people to take control of their own health and learn  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:33):**  how to make their own remedies. We sort of joke that actually, if we're successful with  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:38):**  our vision and aim for the project, people won't need to buy our products in the end  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:43):**  because they're going to be empowered to be able to make them at home. And that's really  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:46):**  our aim is to create a community of sovereign individuals who know how to use the herbs  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:52):**  that grow all around us, often like weeds in the hedgerows or between the cracks in  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:11:56):**  the pavements, know how to harvest them and know how to make their own medicine. We were  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:01):**  really keen to offer our members a chance to connect. I mean, obviously we set up the  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:06):**  company during lockdown. So there was lots of restrictions happening at that point. And  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:10):**  now things have opened up a bit. We are able to host in-person events, but some of our  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:17):**  members are from other parts of the country. And we just wanted to create a sense of community  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:21):**  amongst the members and offer them some education as well, because we're fairly limited with  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:26):**  what we can actually say about what the herbs do. Usually if you're just a straight up plant  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:31):**  nursery, you can describe what the plants are going to do in the body and what kind  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:38):**  of things they might help you with. But because we're actually producing remedies as well,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:44):**  legally, we're not allowed to say very much, which is a kind of a ridiculous thing about  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:48):**  herbal medicine. So we felt that hosting these online sessions, not only builds community,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:54):**  but also gives people a chance to ask us questions about what to do with their tinctures when  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:12:59):**  they've got them and sort of how it might help them and just give a little overview  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:03):**  of what the herbs are going to be doing, the actions on the body and the affinities with  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:07):**  the different organ systems they have as well. So that was kind of our way round the sort  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:12):**  of legal restrictions that are placed upon us by our system.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:18):**  Food sovereignty is more well known and that's a massive movement. And basically by using  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:22):**  the term health sovereignty, we're aligning ourselves with this movement. But I think  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:26):**  that health sovereignty encompasses a lot more than just food and herbs. It's also about,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:33):**  you know, emotional, spiritual and physical well-being and all that that entails. Yeah,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:39):**  and we're just really keen to empower local people to take control of their health because  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:45):**  it's all available to us. Nature actually holds everything we need, I believe, to maintain  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:50):**  our health at a high level. I still buy my vegetables from a local organic  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:13:56):**  veg box scheme because I don't really want to have to grow all my vegetables. You know,  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:00):**  I grow a bit of greens and salad and stuff, but I don't want to have to grow all my vegetables  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:06):**  because that's not my interest. So same with the herbs, I feel it's like we've got the  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:11):**  expertise and the knowledge to be able to do it properly and make really, really potent  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:14):**  medicine for people. But at the same time, we're sort of offering education if you were  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:18):**  interested in taking that up, maybe not on such a large scale as what we're doing, but  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:22):**  sort of a little bit of foraging and also teaching, you know, your friends, family,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:27):**  and when you're going on your lovely walks around the hedgerows, because like you say,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:33):**  especially at this time of year, the hedgerows are just literally dropping with medicine.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:37):**  I'll just explain a little bit more about what the CSA actually is. So you sign up,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:45):**  you can either pay in full for the whole year or you can do a monthly payment plan to spread  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:51):**  the cost over the over the year. With that, you get four boxes. So it's sort of every  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:14:57):**  season, spring, summer, autumn, winter, we get a box for each of those. All of the plants  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:02):**  that go into the remedies are either grown on our herb farm here without any chemical  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:09):**  pesticides or herbicides. We're not registered organic yet, but we are basically organic  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:15):**  or they're foraged ethically and sustainably from the local hedgerows on the Somerset levels.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:21):**  We aim to sort of include between five and seven different products in each box. And  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:25):**  then you get also access to the community sharing circles, which are online at the moment.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:31):**  And we also host out of community meetup days if you are local to the farm.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:41):**  Up next, we're going to share about something that I can't always wrap my head around. I  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:45):**  have moments of clarity and then it's gone. But it's something that I completely ignored  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:50):**  for a long time until a good friend convinced me to at least understand more about this,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:55):**  because he truly believes that holds some of the possibility for a more equitable and  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:15:59):**  just future. I definitely think we're very far away from that at the moment, but I've  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:06):**  begun to believe that there is potential. You may have heard about blockchain technology  
**[0:16:11-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:11):**  and cryptocurrencies that run via blockchain, such as Bitcoin. Well, in recent years, there  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:20):**  has been a community building these tools with a regenerative mindset. The Regen Network  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:26):**  are leading the way with this, and they've recently launched the Regen Ledger, or their  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:31):**  blockchain. This ledger allows for transparency in all ecosystem credits that are awarded  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:38):**  on it, as well as the transparent exchange of their Regen tokens, which is the associated  
**[0:16:44-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:44):**  cryptocurrency. Regen tokens are essentially like having a share in a company. They have  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:52):**  both economic and governance value in the system which is currently being stewarded  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:16:57):**  by the Regen Network. Alongside this, in order to create agreement about what should be considered  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:03):**  valuable enough to award an ecosystem credit, they've created the Regen Registry. Those  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:10):**  who own Regen tokens have a say in the ecosystem standards on the Regen Registry. So essentially,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:17):**  they have a say in what is valuable ecosystem credit. Sorry, I realise that's a real...  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:23):**  Well, I find it a lot to get my head around at all times, and I hope it makes sense. And  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:29):**  I am definitely not an expert in this by any means, so we're all learning together here,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:33):**  I'd say. And it's very early days still, but the technology does have the potential to  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:39):**  enable a much larger and more diverse community of people to have a voice in the decision-making  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:45):**  of what counts as valuable ecosystem work, or what's worthy of carbon credits. Revathi  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:17:53):**  Kalagala, Executive Director at the Regen Foundation, told us more.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:01):**  I think what's the opportunity here with Regen Network is the lecture in its own way is meant  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:08):**  to represent global ecological health, and stewarded by global communities, so that that's  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:16):**  true. That means at any point, the lecture itself, because of all the data and the technology  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:22):**  behind it, and everything else that you've put into it, the goal is to make sure that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:28):**  it can meaningfully, impactfully, and as accurately as possible reflect ecological health. Now,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:36):**  exactly what that means is going to be decided by the community. And because of blockchain,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:44):**  the community may not know each other, and that is perfectly okay. And in this context,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:52):**  one of the things that sets Regen Network aside is the fact that 30% of the tokens are  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:18:57):**  set aside to explicitly include underrepresented stakeholders, and that includes land stewards  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:04):**  and land-based communities. That's similar to owning 30% of shares of a company, say,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:11):**  where any decision that's made, you can sort of, in some ways, make sure that the decision  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:18):**  does not happen without the voice of the land stewards and other stakeholders.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:26):**  As Revathi said, as part of their commitment to this diversity of voices, the Regen Network  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:31):**  have mandated that 30% of their tokens will be owned by land stewards around the world,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:38):**  and they're being distributed through a grant program via the Regen Foundation. We also  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:43):**  spoke with Rebecca Harmon, who is Partnerships and Community Fund Manager at the Regen Network.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:49):**  Owning a Regen token, it not only holds governance rights and potential economic value, like  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:19:54):**  a share, but as there's no financial institution involved in blockchain transactions, your  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:01):**  Regen tokens can also earn you money because they can be used to help verify all the transactions  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:08):**  on the ledger. This is what staking is, as far as I understand, which is something Rebecca  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:14):**  refers to. Our Community Fund has gifted a lot of different  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:20):**  projects throughout the world with funding and also tokens. So, there's a great project,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:26):**  it's called Kulshan Carbon Trust, and they're doing some really great biochar work on these  
**[0:20:32-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:32):**  smaller farming organizations. They were given tokens, and those tokens, if they decide to  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:42):**  stake them and participate in blockchain in that way, then they will earn a percentage  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:49):**  off of those. They can do whatever they want with those tokens. They can cash them out,  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:20:54):**  they can trade them, they can do whatever they wish. The goal here is to enable another  
**[0:21:02-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:02):**  income source for these farming communities and have that income source be not a function  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:11):**  of their farming, but just something that they deserve to be able to participate in.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:18):**  We see that as a digital divide that we want to bridge, and that's definitely a lot of  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:25):**  our work. It's asking how do we draw land stewards, how do we draw producers into this  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:32):**  strange crypto world and break down language barriers and build trust and create safe spaces  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:39):**  to interact and communicate around this. So, it's very much about capacity, but we see  
**[0:21:45-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:45):**  it as a huge potential if we can identify those bridges to get them involved.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:21:53):**  A lot of communities here that we're also talking of are indigenous communities, communities  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:00):**  who care about the land they live on and the conservation areas and so on and so forth.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:07):**  The fact that they are gatekeepers and just the protectors of this land and these forests  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:15):**  is something that they feel and I agree that the society must reward them with, which right  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:22):**  now takes a long time to do because a big barrier is the scientific rigor it takes to  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:30):**  have something be recognized as a credit. A lot of what exists right now are these big,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:37):**  intimidating, long, rigorous definition of what the credits are published by UN and so  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:46):**  on and so forth. It makes it slightly out of reach. This is a way in which we want to  
**[0:22:52-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:22:52):**  make it closer, accessible, and the way blockchain enables it is we also have a community decision-making  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:00):**  process with deciding on what these credits will be and how to put them on the chain,  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:06):**  how to agree that we're going to say this is a valid methodology. I think that puts  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:13):**  a lot of power back into the farmers and the lands to which it's hence.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:17):**  Microsoft purchased carbon credits for the ecosystem services on the 10,000 hectare Wilmot

**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:29):**  want to understand what some of the transparency looks like, you can go to the Regen Network's  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:34):**  website and see all the monitoring, all the transactions and agreements that have gone  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:39):**  on in rewarding those credits. I was glad to see that while solar organic carbon does  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:44):**  form a large part of the credit, they also have biodiversity monitoring and animal welfare  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:49):**  monitoring woven into it. Of course, the world of cryptocurrencies is extremely young, unpredictable,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:23:56):**  and making the rich richer in most cases at this moment in time. I definitely don't want  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:01):**  to oversell it or ever promise it as something diverse and creating value for many at the  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:08):**  moment. However, the Regen Network gives me some hope that we shouldn't ignore this as  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:14):**  potentially being part of the toolkit for building a more regenerative future.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:19):**  The crypto frenzy is real. The hype is real. It's a wave and like all waves, it will level  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:27):**  out and we're playing a long game. We know that there's digital techno time, which moves  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:34):**  at the speed of light, and then there's land time. Land time and the time it takes to create  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:41):**  new topsoil and to generate change on a landscape is not at the same rate. I think that the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:49):**  question of why to get involved is it is a huge potential opportunity to change power  
**[0:24:57-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:24:57):**  dynamics, change economic dynamics, and point toward more of a livelihood margin for farmers.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:09):**  I think the distinction is that there's the whole crypto space, which is loud and noisy,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:16):**  and within that, there's more of a regenerative crypto space that feels in my estimation,  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:21):**  authentic, and they are in it because they care. They're not in it to try to make a quick  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:27):**  buck off of everyone. I think it's good to differentiate between the whole space and  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:33):**  then the corner of that space where we have really good dialogue about how all of this  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:39):**  should be done and why should farmers participate when there's not hardly any time to be online  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:46):**  anyways. A part of those conversations, we would invite anyone in the audience to come  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:51):**  and join us on and be a part of and share your thoughts and your input. But I do think  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:25:57):**  that as loud as the crypto space can be, it's worthy of exploring the regenerative crypto  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:04):**  lane. Just the other day, I was talking to this  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:07):**  leader of an indigenous community, and they work with one of our partner organizations  
**[0:26:14-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:14):**  on the ground. They're really frustrated. They're based in the Amazon, Browser, and  
**[0:26:26-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:26):**  they're really frustrated with the whole system of carbon credits because they have seen their  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:35):**  land being bought for carbon offsets, but the company that bought the offsets is a mining  
**[0:26:42-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:42):**  company and still had operations running in a different area where a lot of the native  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:51):**  forest was lost because of the activities. These are more than forests to them. This  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:26:59):**  is who they connect with and so on. It's very heartbreaking for them, and that made them  
**[0:27:04-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:04):**  lose faith in the carbon market. They approached us asking how this can change and how the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:17):**  blockchain ecosystem can help. This is the vision, and these are the kinds of cases that  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:24):**  makes us hold on to working on the project and where we are passionate about it as we  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:30):**  are. There is the possibility, like I said, of  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:35):**  defining the kind of credit where it goes beyond carbon. It looks at biodiversity, it  
**[0:27:42-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:42):**  looks at soil health, it looks at things that mean really matter to you. There is the possibility  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:50):**  to also potentially taking a stance and saying, we do want to benefit from the carbon market,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:27:59):**  but we don't want the credits that we sell to go to a buyer who is going to use it for  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:04):**  offsets, for example. Because this can be coded into the technology itself in a way  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:12):**  that you can specify how it's verified, how you can make sure that the buyer meets these  
**[0:28:20-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:20):**  conditions. It gives the communities a kind of power here, which I think is really lacking  
**[0:28:29-0:28:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:29):**  today with existing registry and definitions of the carbon market and credits and so on.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:39):**  I think it's this empowerment that's where the hopeful future lies. There are huge parts  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:51):**  of the crypto and blockchain boom that are speculative and is filled with people who  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/72-new-food-media-herbal-csas-and-regenerative-supporting-blockchain#t=0:28:57):**  just want to know how can we best trade so we can make money off of it. But there are

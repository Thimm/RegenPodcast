**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:00):**  Hi Summer, it's beautiful. With the herbs you get some really tall herbs and you get  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:11):**  sort of the low level ground herbs so it's actually really easy to make your garden look  
**[0:00:16-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:16):**  amazing and have it head to toe in the medicinals. On the sort of tall level you've got the marshmallow  
**[0:00:23-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:23):**  and the goldenrod. The goldenrod is this bright yellow tail waving in the air and the marshmallow  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:31):**  is just like, it has this super soft leaves that you just want to rub on your face and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:37):**  you can nibble on the flowers as well. And you've got the meadow sweet which is giving  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:41):**  off its like queen of the meadow scent all over your garden. And then like mid level  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:47):**  you've got like the mints or the vervain or things like that and then on the low level  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:00:54):**  you might have ground ivy or some other creepers maybe. Maybe even things like, you know a  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:03):**  lot of the common weeds like, I mean nettles are fully welcome in my garden but white dead  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:09):**  nettles as well you know they provide amazing nectar for early nectar sources and yeah there's  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:15):**  so many medicinal weeds, there's so many medicinal flowers and I think also part of the education  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:21):**  could be to help people include more medicinals just in their everyday gardens and how to  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:27):**  use them because they really are beautiful and so colourful and you know massively useful  
**[0:01:32-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:32):**  and quite safe you know herbal medicine is really safe for the masses as well generally speaking.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:47):**  I'm Alice Bettany, I'm a herbalist and I run Sacred Seeds Herbal Project which mostly  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:01:53):**  encompasses the herbal box scheme which is loosely based or on a CSA but it's often  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:01):**  termed CSH, the community supported herbalism. It's a little bit of, yeah my inspiration  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:07):**  basically came from the States where there's loads of really successful projects out there  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:12):**  all across the States and in Canada and there hasn't been any successful projects in the  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:17):**  UK and at the moment I'm the only herbal box scheme that's running so it's, I guess I'm  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:23):**  just testing out that market for myself and really enjoying the creative process. Maybe  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:28):**  it would be good to talk a little bit about why and how you got into it, a little bit  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:33):**  about your background. So I probably came into it from really wanting to teach more  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:39):**  people about being self-sufficient with their medicine needs, with their health needs and  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:46):**  so I do lots of foraging workshops, teaching people how to forage for food and medicine.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:52):**  We run a home herbal, home-ed herbal program with young children and I really appreciate  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:02:59):**  that. So the box scheme for me is all about education. So they get the ready-made products  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:05):**  but they also get all the information on how to recreate those products themselves again  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:10):**  at home, details about how to, details about all of the herbs that are involved, included  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:16):**  in those products, plant profiles, seeds for them to grow their own herbs at home as well.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:22):**  So it's really about basically moving away from a dependent healthcare system to being  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:29):**  really independent, learning how to use the weeds that are growing underneath our feet  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:33):**  and learning how to be more self-sufficient which is bringing back the people's medicine,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:38):**  herbal medicine to the people really is probably my passion and drive. And maybe you could  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:44):**  talk a little bit about like your situation, how you choose what to grow and what you found  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:52):**  to be most successful maybe.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:53):**  I was probably going to say I'm really hit and miss actually. So I rely, I don't, I'm  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:03:58):**  not completely self-sufficient for my box, her box needs. I forage for quite a lot so  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:02):**  it also depends on the season and what's been done well in the hedgerows and so forth. I've  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:09):**  had a bit of a battle with mice eating lots of my roots that I've been growing. They love  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:14):**  chicory root and they also love the milk thistle seeds. And so there's been a few trial and  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:19):**  tribulations. Fortunately with herbal medicine, most of the herbs are perennial. So it's just  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:25):**  a case of getting them established, letting them grow and grow and grow and yeah, harvesting  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:30):**  them and coppicing them right. I mean the medicine cabinet goes, you know, there's not  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:36):**  so many annuals so it is a lot of perennials but it's also shrubs and trees. So it takes  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:41):**  quite a long time to establish my garden. So I'm still in the early stages really and  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:47):**  I supplement my needs from buying and from organic sources as well.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:50):**  And in terms of like who to sell to, so you're doing the CSA scheme, but do you sell to other  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:56):**  people or how are you, yeah, how did you get started that way?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:04:59):**  So I advertise, it's all been online advertisement and I have, I probably about 20, 30% of my  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:06):**  box subscribers are local and the rest are nationwide. So I ship all over the country,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:13):**  which is brilliant and I'm able to do that because of technology and I have a Skype consultation  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:19):**  with them to make sure that all the medicines I send them are safe and not contraindicated  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:26):**  with any medicines or conditions that they might have. So yeah, the market, I guess no  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:33):**  one else is doing the box scheme so the market isn't as established as it is in the States  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:38):**  for instance. And to be honest, the general public is still catching up and still needs  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:45):**  to be better educated about what herbal medicine actually is. So there's the whole wider conversation  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:51):**  around how herbs can be implicated in your health.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:05:55):**  So if someone wanted to start growing herbs tomorrow or say you have a farm with like  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:00):**  lots of different things going on, like what would your tips be to get started?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:04):**  You need to know what soil you've got. Depending on herbs, we'll like different soils. Some  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:09):**  will like, some love clay, some love sandy, loamy. It kind of varies a lot. Wildflowers  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:16):**  really like the chalk, chalk down areas. You can recreate that of course as well if you  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:23):**  needed to. Generally my advice, I sometimes do a little bit of garden design of the garden  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:28):**  advice for people and I normally ask them what are their most common elements in the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:33):**  household. And so quite often let's say respiratory issues come up really commonly. So I'll be  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:38):**  like, okay, is it coughs, is it colds, what is it? And then we'll plan their garden for  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:43):**  their household medical needs and then they can start using them straight away and they  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:47):**  can reap the benefits and they're not just going to be sort of planted and obscure herbs  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:52):**  they're not going to use very often. So yeah, it's more about individual needs.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:06:57):**  And just getting out there and using the wild edges as well. You'll have all of the wild  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:04):**  weeds, the nettles, the dandelions, the ground ivy will all be available already no doubt  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:10):**  on your land as well. So it's, I guess a good starting point is really learning your plant  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:15):**  identification, learning about the wild weeds and starting to do some foraging of your own.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:21):**  Obviously you're trialing a CSA model, which is great. And in terms of some of the UK market  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:31):**  organic herbs kind of issues that were brought up, are they issues for you? I mean, do you,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:38):**  if you do expand, do you want to be selling to bigger market? Like what do you see going  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:42):**  forward are your issues?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:44):**  Good question. The common denominator that most herb growers have is that big, it's the  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:52):**  big topic of the talk is the drying and the preservation of the herbs to do them in a  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:07:58):**  healthy pathogen way, pathogen free way. So yeah, you know, whether we need the steamer,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:06):**  industrial steamer, whether we need like an industrial drying system, I have a lot of  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:12):**  problems with space and enough areas to dry my harvest. So it's a continual issue for  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:21):**  me really. I guess I need to maintain my market too. I need to be able to sell enough boxes  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:27):**  to make it worth my while. And the number's quite high. It's like above 35 boxes really  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:32):**  per quarter to make it worth my while financially. And that has to be sort of sustained. So people  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:39):**  can buy one off box or they can sign it for a year. So I need to continually be getting  
**[0:08:44-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:44):**  new subscribers, which is a challenge. And I guess the general challenge around any grower  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:08:57):**  that's going to have an issue around pests and diseases and losses in that way. So I'm  
**[0:09:05-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:05):**  still learning how to manage that organically and dealing with various insects. The market  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:15):**  value of medicinal herbs or herbs is really low in the UK. So that's, I guess, an issue  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:21):**  to address. I mean, with my business model for my herb box, essentially I don't get paid  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:28):**  for any of the work that I do in my garden. So I get paid for making the products, doing  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:36):**  all the written online information that they get and packaging it up and so forth. But  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:41):**  all the garden work is essentially my labor of love that I do. I would probably be doing  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:48):**  it anyway because it fulfills me on lots of levels. I am growing the herbs, not just for  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:53):**  my box scheme, but to make medicines for my dispensary. And it feeds into my business  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:09:58):**  in lots of other ways and the workshops that I do and so forth. So that's just how it is  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:10:03):**  for me. Hopefully within about five years time, my business model should tell me that  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:10:09):**  I should get paid for a bit more gardening time later on down the line. So it's just  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:10:14):**  that time of investment, labor of love and making it work. It's working for me at the  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:10:19):**  moment. So that's where I'm at.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-alice-bettany-from-sacred-seeds-herbal-project#t=0:10:49):**  Thank you.

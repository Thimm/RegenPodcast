## 06: Oxford Real Farming Conference, health CSA, Field of Wheat, cover crops + no-till, & land songs  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  The land, the land, the day the sun was set.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:04):**  The land, the land, the ground the trees stood on.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:07):**  This year things are different.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:09):**  I mean there is an energy here, the number of young people here.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:12):**  The land was meant for the people.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  This month, PharmaRama is at the Oxford Real Farming Conference.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:23):**  The diversity of the people represented here,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:26):**  I mean right through from the Land Workers Alliance back, you know,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:30):**  Occupy movements to radical people and people who are crossing the floor  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:38):**  or in this case the road from the other conference, Mainstream Farmers.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:42):**  It's incredible. I mean it really, something is happening here.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:47):**  Patrick Holden who is Chief Executive of the Sustainable Food Trust.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:52):**  Now the other conference is the Oxford Farming Conference,  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:56):**  which is not to be confused with the Oxford Real Farming Conference.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:00:59):**  And it takes place at the same time just down the road.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:04):**  That could be confusing.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:06):**  It's quite confusing, but we'll get our heads around it.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:10):**  Colin Tudge who co-founded the Oxford Real Farming Conference  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:14):**  says the difference is that the other conference is about farming  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:18):**  purely focused on increasing profits.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:21):**  Whereas the Oxford Real Farming Conference is about agroecological farming methods.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:27):**  Farming focused on feeding the world supported by sustainable enterprises  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:32):**  that don't harm the planet.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:34):**  Too much.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:36):**  Too much. Don't harm the planet too much along the way.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:40):**  I love the way there's this sort of alchemy of different ideas and perspectives  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:45):**  interacting with each other in extraordinary ways.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:48):**  The world is complex and diverse, ecosystems are complex and diverse  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:52):**  and we've got a food ecosystem culture thing going on here at Oxford.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:01:57):**  I never thought I'd see the day. It's a beautiful thing.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  The FarmRama team have been here talking to a huge mix of growers and scientists  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:07):**  and getting stuck into discussions throughout the week.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:11):**  Here's a grower, writer and self-proclaimed mud herder, Kate Collins.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:16):**  I think bringing together some of the thoughts that resonated with many  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:20):**  throughout the couple of days.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:22):**  I think it's really interesting to have the big estates guys  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:24):**  so the National Trust, the Duchy of Cornwall in a session  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  shortly followed by an Access to Land session.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:30):**  It's really nice to have all those people in the same conference.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  I didn't really expect the big estates guys to appear here  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:36):**  so it's really interesting to see them.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:38):**  So there was a couple of, I think it was John Valtry,  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  his original presentation was very much a halfway kind of meeting place.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:45):**  Some meetings of mine but I think there might be still a long way to go  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:49):**  for other mines.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  There's still very much a sense that the two conferences represent different  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:02:55):**  world views and that only so much talking is possible or even desired.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:00):**  But this year there was certainly a focus on discussions that cross barriers  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:04):**  and link up everyone.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  I think that the debates that particularly have interested me,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:12):**  one of which I was involved with yesterday, have been ways in which we can  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:18):**  change the business case, as conventional people would put it,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:22):**  or the economics of sustainable food production in such a way that it can  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  become profitable for more farmers because at the moment the truth is that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:32):**  all the people here that have farmed in some cases for many years sustainably  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:37):**  have done so knowing that they'll make less money than if they farmed  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  in an exploitive and intensive way.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:43):**  And they've either subsidised the losses with a day job like I have or they've  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:47):**  been entrepreneurs and they've developed new markets or they've just accepted  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  the fact they make virtually no money.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:53):**  And that's fine but if we want this thing to become mainstream,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:03:57):**  which we need it to, the economics of it have to change.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  Most of the world's food is still produced by smallholder farmers and so it's  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:05):**  really important that the role of smallholder farmers is acknowledged  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:10):**  and that in a way the small can be the beautiful representation of the cellular  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:17):**  nature of all food systems.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:20):**  There's nothing wrong with larger scale operations per se as long as they adhere  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  to the same laws and principles.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:28):**  Big is not necessarily bad but I think if you are big or you have access to large  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:33):**  resources you have greater responsibilities to use them wisely  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  and to practise stewardship.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:40):**  So I think that I'm making the case for coexistence really.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:44):**  I'm simply saying if we're too angry and too against them,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:48):**  them being big, bad and industrial, I think we forget the fact that we're  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:52):**  standing in front of now a global ecological crisis and we've got to work  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:04:57):**  more inclusively if we're going to stand any chance of avoiding a guy and  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  population collapse which people like James Lovelock are predicting now.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:06):**  A's for the AC, the sticks in your ear. B is for barley with which we make beer.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:13):**  C is for seasons, we know them right well. D is for cow dung of which we all smell.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:20):**  E's for E over there, pinching is sweet. F for the effort that every farm need.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:27):**  G is for good, it's a word us don't know. H is for holiday, where shall us go?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:33):**  Now Nigel and I are in the Farmer Mamas studio but Abby is doing her links  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:38):**  from the vegetable garden on her family's farm in Chile where she jetted off  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:43):**  straight after the conference. We'll be hearing more from Abby out there  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:47):**  in the next show but here she is now to tell us about what tickled her pickle  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:54):**  in Oxford.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:05:58):**  It was actually an art project that really caught my attention.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:02):**  It's called A Field of Wheat. It's the culmination of two years of exploration  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:08):**  of the breadbasket of the UK by artists Anne-Marie and Ruth.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:12):**  They had a sort of open call to anyone who wanted to become a collective investor  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:17):**  slash stakeholder slash advisor of a 22 acre field on Peter's conventional farm  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:23):**  in Lincolnshire and it all started with them planting some wheat.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:27):**  Here are Anne-Marie and Peter explaining a bit more.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:31):**  Two artists came and approached me and were talking about doing this project  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:36):**  which is to grow a field of wheat as an art project and being a farmer from  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:41):**  Lincolnshire and a bit backward I sort of had this vision of painting it pink  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  and carving shapes with combines or I don't know quite what.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:49):**  It's a different type of art really.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  What we're trying to do is draw people into conversation with each other  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:06:57):**  and also for them to get to understand arable farming in more detail  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:01):**  through focusing our collective gaze on one particular field of wheat in Lincolnshire.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:06):**  We've created a small collective of around 40 people  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  and they're all from really diverse backgrounds.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:14):**  So some of them are from farming industry, some of them are local residents  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:18):**  who maybe live rurally but have no idea about farming.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:22):**  Some are academics, some are artists, it's a real intentional cross disciplinary mix.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:28):**  Part of the project incorporates this rather curious idea that's been adopted  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:32):**  from the Quaker religion where people speak and then others take time  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  and stop and consider and then someone else speaks.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:40):**  So through this collective the idea is that everybody's views are valid  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:45):**  because we've got such a diverse view across the collective  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  and everybody's view is equally relevant and equally important  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:54):**  and somehow we have to bring all these diverse views together  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:07:57):**  to manage and grow a crop of wheat.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:00):**  Through the cycle of the growing of the wheat through to the harvest time  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  we provide opportunities for them to physically come together on the farm  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  or for example on trips that we're doing off the farm  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:12):**  to look at the wider stories around wheat farming  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:15):**  so that could take in history, it could take in ecology, the culture.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  Wheat is a big part of our culture, it's one of the basis of our civilisation.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:26):**  So what we're trying to do is bring together the practical basis of farming  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:31):**  with all those other elements and explore those through different forms of dialogues.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:37):**  What I'm beginning to understand now is how valuable this can be  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:41):**  in terms of getting a message out to a large number of people with a very diverse view.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:48):**  It's something I've campaigned about individually for a very long time  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:52):**  about sustainable farming and trying to promote sustainable farming  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:08:56):**  within the 95% of farmers who use agrochemicals and fertilisers and things.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:01):**  And the idea that you can use art to promote that is something that's  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:06):**  well initially totally alien to me but now I'm beginning to understand  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:10):**  and I think that's something that farmers get really quite excited about.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:13):**  What we're trying to look at is saying what is the current system,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:16):**  what is the dominant current system?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:18):**  We need to look at that, we need to really understand that  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:21):**  and do we like what we see? Are we okay with it?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  Are we okay with low input conventional? Are we okay with really high input?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:30):**  Do we want to switch to a different system altogether?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  Do we want to stop growing grains?  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:35):**  The front of it is the beginning of a way forward for farming as a whole.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:41):**  In some ways it feels as if it could actually scale up,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  make a conversation between farmers and consumers,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  this conversation that we seem to be unable to have.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:53):**  So maybe we could be reunited, maybe we could have this conversation  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:09:56):**  and maybe we could develop a kind of farming that not only delivers  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:00):**  a farmer a decent income and a return on his investment  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:04):**  but also we start to deal with all these social issues, environmental issues  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:09):**  that are such an important part of farming.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:12):**  Arable is something that's really hidden in our culture.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  I'd never been out, I didn't think I was allowed,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:19):**  kind of out into the big fields, you know.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:21):**  It's somewhere that you're not necessarily allowed to go,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:24):**  you feel like you're trespassing.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:25):**  In fact you never see anyone on the land, if you're on a train in the UK  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  it's very, very rare that you even see somebody in the fields.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:31):**  So what's it feel like to be there? If it's a monoculture,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:34):**  what does that feel like? What's growing around the edges?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:37):**  All that detail around what is this piece of land doing  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  and are we happy with the way that our relationship with it, we're exploring.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  What it has done is expanded my understanding a lot more  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  of other people's views around farming, food.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  So essentially I'm sort of revisiting decisions that I made many years ago  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:10:59):**  and have always stuck with and I'm beginning to question those decisions now  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:03):**  and wondering whether I am doing the right thing.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:07):**  I think one of the things that I've learnt through coming to things like  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:11):**  the Oxford Real Farming Conference, talking to members of the public,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  public events and things, is that the public have a huge understanding of farming.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:21):**  And I often find that members of the public actually have a far greater understanding  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:25):**  of farming than I have of their lives and the pressures and difficulties they face  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:30):**  in their lives. And I think what this is bringing out is this divorce  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:36):**  between the farmer and the consumer.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:39):**  We've got farmers who wouldn't recognise a member of the public if they fell over one now  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:44):**  because they become insular. They don't talk to members of the public,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:47):**  they only talk to other farmers.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:49):**  And we've got members of the public who believe that farmers are nothing more  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:53):**  than subsidy junkies who drive round in Range Rovers shouting,  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:56):**  go off my land. Neither is true.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:11:59):**  And the only way I think that we can ever make any sense of this situation  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:05):**  and bring farming back to its roots, back to the consumer,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:09):**  and actually start to deliver what the British public want in terms of food,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:14):**  social support, a vibrant rural economy and good environmental benefits,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:20):**  is by bringing the farmer and the consumer back together so they can talk to each other.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:25):**  And if it's through things like the field of wheat project that we can do that kind of thing,  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:30):**  then let's bring it on.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:32):**  Farmerama are now a member of the collective too.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:36):**  We invested. So we will be helping to decide how the wheat is farmed,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:40):**  where the wheat is going, who it's sold to.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:43):**  Will it be wheat for humans or for animals?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:47):**  Or maybe it will not be sold as a food product at all.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:50):**  This project is definitely about building bridges and fits with the familiar Farmerama theme  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:12:55):**  that things that sing to us are the ones that consider the whole process from humans to soil.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:02):**  We are so behind building bridges and discussions across the divide to form answers for the future.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:09):**  But what compensations are going to be made? Or is it not like that?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:14):**  Why are these discussions important? What about doing?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:19):**  I guess for me that's the beauty of this art project, the field of wheat,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:23):**  is that they are actually doing and discussing at the same time.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:28):**  So there is an outcome. A whole field of wheat will be grown and, you know,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:33):**  people will either lose money, make the same, or maybe gain money.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  They'll see the effects on the field, the soil, they'll understand the markets,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  how that will affect everything, we'll help decide whether we use chemicals or pesticides or fertilizers or not.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  And so many different perspectives are coming in, feeding into that discussion.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:00):**  So it will both be doing and talking at the same time, debating at the same time.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:09):**  I is for the interest on our overdraft, J is for a jade saw with which we go down,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  K is for Clifton a pallet of cake, she's an ale of a maid, what a farmer she'll make,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:22):**  N is for mother I made her pay her way, with the N in the chicken house and the eggs that they lay,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  O is for old Lord and to him we pray, for the P is a pig as it's litter today.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:35):**  The trend towards well-being as part of health provision has created a great opportunity for farming,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:41):**  as people begin to understand links between the integrity of what we eat and our health.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:48):**  It seems to be something we're seeing more and more of.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:51):**  Back in episode two we spoke to Tom O'Kane of Kai Tai CSA in Swansea.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  He's a very inspiring grower who runs his CSA as a wider community project,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  working with local young people, councils and more.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:04):**  And in Oxford we met another young grower from Wales.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:07):**  He was inspired by Tom's thinking and is taking it one step further  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  and setting up a CSA in the grounds of a hospital.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:15):**  Regular Roving reporter Ben Raskin of the Soil Association spoke to him to find out more.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:21):**  Me and a friend of mine basically bumped into the CSA model about six months ago.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:29):**  And me, I've always wanted to grow veg on a bigger scale than just like a hobby.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  But I didn't want to do it on my own.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:38):**  Doing it on the farm is quite, I just don't want to do it on my own.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:41):**  I want to be working with other people and the CSA model just ticked all those boxes for me.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:47):**  It took a bit of the risk away, well shared the risk.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  So we went to the Welsh Gathering in the summer and met especially Tom O'Kane from the Gower Power  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:01):**  and he just inspired us just to go for it.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:04):**  And we're at the point now where we're in contact with a small hospital outside,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:10):**  with land around it, two and a half, three acres of usable horticultural land.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:17):**  And basically that's where we're hoping to start our CSA.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:22):**  So you'll then, will you rent the land from the hospital or are they going to let you use it?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:26):**  They'll let us use it because the cost for them to manage it, just as grassland is,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  well it's cheaper for them to let us use it.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:36):**  But they also like the idea of the CSA being there because they're,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:40):**  50% of their care is with young dementia sufferers, still physically abled,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:46):**  looking at quite a long life of dementia suffering.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  So were you thinking there might be opportunities, A, to sort of supply food into the hospital,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:16:57):**  but also for people to come out and work from the hospital on the...  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:00):**  We hadn't really planned this hospital around.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:02):**  It was the girl who I'm in partnership with, she manages an orchard on the land,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:08):**  which she will do in the future anyway.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:10):**  And just once we started talking to the trustees of the land, they just loved it.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:16):**  And it makes sense, it makes a lot of sense for us.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  As the hospital moves to like a wellbeing centre, they say CSA model just works perfect.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:26):**  But there would definitely be so many possible work that we could do for them,  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:32):**  and they could use us.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  So it just seems like a brilliant idea, something that all hospitals should do.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:38):**  Well, absolutely.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:39):**  Maybe.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:40):**  Well, funnily enough, I added, this is not part of this, but I had an idea when I,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:43):**  because I used to be a grower, and when I stopped,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:46):**  when I decided to stop growing for other people because I was always employed,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:50):**  my idea was to set up a farm shop and growing.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:54):**  At the time, it was sort of independent, but on a hospital, next to a hospital,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:17:58):**  with the idea of having this farm shop on the hospital and supplying into it,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  because it's about positive health.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:03):**  It all just makes sense.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:05):**  So we're basically waiting for the final confirmation, which there is a chance it doesn't work.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  So where we go from then, we've still got options.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:15):**  And because you and your friend have both got sort of land and family farm,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:20):**  is there sort of plans maybe to connect those farms into that CSA at some point?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:25):**  More at the moment, it's going to be, they're definitely being used,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:29):**  or mine especially, to start it up.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:31):**  So my polytunnel up the farm, I've got a large polytunnel,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:34):**  is already growing for the hopeful eventuality of the CSA going ahead.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  So it gives us a, it definitely gives us, and we've got the machinery that goes,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:46):**  the farm has grown veg before, so we've got a lot of the machinery to help start us off.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:51):**  We've been to farmers markets and asked to see what the sort of public,  
**[0:18:54-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:18:54):**  the community would buy into it, and there's no problem with getting our original target of 30 members.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:04):**  It's just they wouldn't then, we start sort of wondering where would we go from there.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:09):**  And that's sort of, it's quite hard, because although we started off with a definite plan,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:13):**  just in the last four or five weeks it's going, oh maybe, oh,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:16):**  and that's what I spoke to this last couple of days,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:19):**  has answered quite a few questions, but has brought up about ten times more.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:24):**  And often until you actually get on and start doing it,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:27):**  and every situation is different, every group of people is different,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:30):**  and so you've sort of, you know, you've got that membership group,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:33):**  you won't know how it's going to work probably.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:35):**  And like this feeling of a little bit of, oh, it's actually, well,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:39):**  it's just a normal feeling, just go with it, you know, that's part of the excitement.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:44):**  We've heard a few examples of extra land that organisations and trusts own,  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:49):**  that they are allocating to CSAs for growing veg.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:54):**  It seems to be a win-win solution,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:19:56):**  and it's a really great potential opportunity for budding growers.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:00):**  Do you listening to this have any more examples of this?

**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:18):**  Here we are at Yorkshire Real Farming Conference 2016.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  We're at the Jam Factory, surrounded by lots of young farmers.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  It's not a ceili, it's better than a ceili.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:31):**  Hey, baby.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:35):**  Farmerama, yeah?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:38):**  Farmerama.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:46):**  One topic that affects almost all farmers is that of cover crops.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:50):**  As EU regulations continue to restrict chemical use  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  and the importance of the health of our soils becomes clearer,  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:20:57):**  both conventional and organic farmers are returning to the simple cover crop.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:02):**  Okay, Nigel, so before we hear a bit more about this,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  I need to just back up a little bit and what is a cover crop?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:10):**  So, Joe, a cover crop is basically a crop that a farmer will plant  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:16):**  after he harvests his main crop as a way of protecting the soil,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:23):**  basically ensure that there isn't any kind of soil erosion,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:26):**  and it can also put some fertility back into the soil as well.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:31):**  How do you get rid of that when you want to plant your next field of wheat?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:35):**  So traditionally, a lot of farmers would actually till their soil,  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:39):**  so they'd turn it over, i.e. plough it, and that would get rid of the cover crop,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:45):**  essentially bury that cover crop.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:48):**  But a lot of farmers will also spray Roundup on their fields.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:55):**  Okay, okay, okay, whoa. And Roundup is...?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  So Roundup is essentially weed killer.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:02):**  Okay, so it seems crazy to me that you're spraying poison all over your field  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:07):**  just before you're planting a new crop, right?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:10):**  Increasingly, there are more people that are thinking up new ways  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:15):**  to make the cover crop move on.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:18):**  Peter Brown is Director of the Biodynamic Association in the UK,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:23):**  and he's been trying one solution.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:25):**  On a biodynamic farm, one of the main principles is  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:28):**  that you're not buying in inputs or fertilisers or animal feed from off the farm,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:32):**  so that really means that you have to produce all the fertility on the farm.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  And that's why the newer developments with cover crops are so exciting,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:40):**  specifically when we're not just talking about a single crop like mustard or lupins or something,  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:46):**  but we're talking about these multiple species cover crops.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:49):**  I have to admit, it's only the last years that I've really understood about the root extrudates.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:54):**  Roots are putting out and feeding the bacteria and how that is all working,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:22:57):**  and the more one knows about that, the more sense it makes.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  But the thing is that these crops can come up two, three, four feet high.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:05):**  You know, you can have sunflowers that can be even taller.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:08):**  And how do you work that in?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  And on the no-till conventional side, they're of course using Roundup to kill it off.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  And we've been working with Friedrich Vents, who's a biodynamic farmer from Germany,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:19):**  who's been doing a lot of work in this area, and he came over last summer and did a workshop with us.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:24):**  And we've been experimenting with that, and we've been growing quite a few fields  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:28):**  with these mixed cover crops with a whole variety of stuff.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:32):**  And we've taken up his idea where we've got this rotavator, which can, you know,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:39):**  I think it works at a thousand revs or whatever, faster than a normal one.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:45):**  But what also makes it special is that you've got wheels on to ensure that you can regulate the depth.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:52):**  And so we literally only go an inch into the actual soil,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:23:56):**  and you can drive across your cover crop, and it'll chop it all up and mix it with a little bit of soil.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:05):**  And at the same time as we're driving, and the reason for the high speed is that you can drive your tractor much faster.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:12):**  Normally when you rotavate for your soil, you know, you're sort of crawling across the field.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  But this allows you to get a decent amount done.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  And we're spraying on EM or a biodynamic cow manure spray to help the breakdown process.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:30):**  It's not no-till, and that's very difficult to do organically,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:36):**  particularly if you don't have hard frost to kill things off.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  So by having this rotavator method, it's a management tool to do that whenever you need to do it,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:45):**  through the summer or the autumn.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:48):**  And yeah, it's only our first season with it, but we're very pleased with the results.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  And our winter crops, our autumn crops are coming up very beautifully where we've had the cover crops.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:00):**  And although it's not got the complete armor of a no-till, you've still got all of that crop in the top inch.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:07):**  So most of it is above the soil.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:09):**  So it's a very, very good compromise as far as we're concerned.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:13):**  You know, if you're using like vetch and rye the way that one can see with a roller crimper,  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:21):**  and you can actually sow your next crop at the same time as you're rolling it,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:25):**  I mean, that's optimum in my view.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:29):**  But when you've got a multi-species cover crop with buckwheat,  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:34):**  which can flower quite soon, and forcelia and all of those things,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:38):**  you don't necessarily want them all going to seed, and they ripen at different stages.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:44):**  So I think this is the way that enables one to do that.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:48):**  And I'm very excited at the potential of cover crops in helping all farms,  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:25:55):**  but you know, specifically us as biodynamic farms, to increase our organic matter.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:00):**  Cues for the cue that we like to make. On the R is the road where our time must do take.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:07):**  S is for sheep when they go to new grass. T for the tractor where we sit on our ass.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:14):**  U is for the owls that we know's on the path. V is for vets when they tries to get out.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:20):**  W is for work we don't get any play, but as I'll see you at Exeter and Market next day.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:27):**  Y is for why do we stay on the land. Z for the zutty that we get in our hand.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:34):**  You can tell from the words our Bill wrote to his book,  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:37):**  Old lusty farmers, they faint quite as daft as they look.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:49):**  We want to finish by saying thanks to Robin Gray of Three Acres and a Cow  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  for his singing session at the farming conference Fringe.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:26:57):**  It was such a wonderful addition to the conference, really filled our souls with joy.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/06-farmerama#t=0:27:02):**  He took us through a history of land rights and protest, all in folk song.

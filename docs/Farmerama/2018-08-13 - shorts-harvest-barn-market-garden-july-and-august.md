## Shorts: Harvest Barn Market Garden July and August  
**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everyone, it's Friday the 27th of July. It's Joel here at the Market Garden at the  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:14):**  Harvest Barn Farm Shop just outside Peterborough and the storm has hit finally after two months  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:20):**  without rain. It's finally raining and very windy so I was just loading up the car to  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:27):**  go down to London. I've been spending all day harvesting and processing veg and flowers to  
**[0:00:32-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:32):**  take to various people in London. I wanted to make that slightly more efficient but as normal I  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:39):**  usually leave the doors of the polytunnel open while I'm away because I don't want it to get  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:43):**  too hot in here. But the pallet which I sort of semi closed the door with fell over and squashed  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:49):**  some tomatoes and chillies which is a bit of a shame but it was just watering actually because  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:00:56):**  it's been forecasting to rain for a while and hasn't so I didn't want to risk it but as I was  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:01:02):**  watering the clouds were coming over so I stopped and started loading and hopefully this will  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:01:10):**  replenish the moisture in the soil. Right more about that later I better get packing because  
**[0:01:17-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/joel-rodker-july-august#t=0:01:17):**  I'm a bit late. Bye for now.

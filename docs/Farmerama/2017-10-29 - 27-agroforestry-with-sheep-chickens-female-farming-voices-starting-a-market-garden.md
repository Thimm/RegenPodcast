**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:06):**  for us.

**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:13):**  The Woodland Trust have given us help with building tree boxes which they've planted,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:18):**  they've built the tree boxes and they've planted them up.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:21):**  So we've got about three or four different tree species in each box.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:26):**  We've probably got about 40 or 50 tree boxes around the farm and they've also just recently

**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:47):**  seeing an economic advantage from doing it and keep going until we run out of space.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:54):**  Well our farm is in the Pennines and it's bleak, there's lots of stone walls, hardly  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:01):**  any trees really, no hedges and so we've got these sheep and we've got to keep them alive  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:07):**  and we've got to produce lambs.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:10):**  Shelter is a real problem so the hedges help with the shelter, the trees we've planted  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:15):**  in to create shelter belts, they help keep the lambs alive.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:21):**  But also we'll be there for quite a few years and trees and hedges just make it a nicer  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:28):**  place to be and you don't really want to spend all your life living on a bleak, miserable  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:35):**  hill farm.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:37):**  So hopefully it will help us make money and look prettier.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:42):**  When we first started at this farm we were lambing indoors and we've soon come to a conclusion  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:49):**  that it's pretty labour intensive and we wanted to lamb everything outdoors.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:54):**  So we've moved away from having fairly unproductive hill sheep towards a white-faced flock but  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:04):**  with that comes the fact that the lambs are probably slightly less hardy so we thought  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:09):**  well we're going to need to make some more shelter, more windbreaks and luckily Pete  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:15):**  Leeson turned up on the scene and given us an awful lot of help with planting our trees  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:23):**  and also his knowledge and understanding of the subject.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:28):**  He's quite an environmentalist and worries a lot about soil and stuff and because of

**[0:06:38-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:38):**  wanted to double fence it three metres wide which is quite a lot of field to take out.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:52):**  So we had quite a lot of arguments in the field with the fencing contractor, they got  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:56):**  quite heated, I don't think I cried but I could well have done.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:02):**  My concern was that it was going to take a big chunk of perfectly productive grassland  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:08):**  out so I had to get over that and watch all this perfectly good field being fenced but  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:15):**  as soon as we started planting and it started to grow I had to kind of eat my words because  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:21):**  it has been a huge benefit to the farm.

**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:28):**  of the non-profits and things like that, it seemed really important to me.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:31):**  And so creating this space where everyone can come together, so it's a conference celebrating  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:34):**  women but it's certainly not only for women, the more men that come I think that more powerful  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:39):**  that is.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:40):**  So that women from across the movement, whether they're farmers working in policy and academia  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:44):**  and advocacy can come together and cross-pollinate and learn about the different things that  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:47):**  are happening.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:49):**  This year's theme was around storytelling and connection and collective resistance because  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:54):**  we're all struggling with this very dire political situation here in the US.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:57):**  That I also felt like bringing that theme kind of a more politicized theme this year  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:02):**  was also really important to help strengthen people's morale and also just the connections  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:07):**  that can be built through that.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:08):**  This work is really hard.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:09):**  It's been quite a challenge for me to figure out how to balance doing the work on the land,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:13):**  which keeps me grounded and I think makes me feel more genuine and rooted in the work  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:18):**  I'm doing and also doing this more systems level work and trying to bring voices together  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:22):**  and be this bridge.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:23):**  It's not hard emotionally, I mean I'm exhausted for sure, but it's hard financially.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:28):**  It's like, you know, it's work that is not traditionally financially valued in our society.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:33):**  And so figuring out how to make this all financially viable is definitely a big step and figuring  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:39):**  out who really wants to support this work is a big step that will help with the longevity  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:44):**  of it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:45):**  From a personal standpoint, it's like everything that I want to be doing.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:48):**  You know, I mentioned at the end of the conference today that yesterday I was thinking, okay,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:53):**  this might be it.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:54):**  Like, you know, this is, it's a lot of work.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:56):**  Like it's amazing, but it's a lot of work.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:57):**  I have no idea how many people are going to come.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:59):**  And then as soon as the first panel was 10 minutes in, all I think is, oh my God, how  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:02):**  can I not do this?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:03):**  I have to keep doing this.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:04):**  I have to keep bringing these people together and doing this work because it's so, it's  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:08):**  so moving and inspiring and it like, I feel like it's so important for us to all come  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:12):**  together like this.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:13):**  So I think it's, it's time to start listening.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:17):**  It's time to quiet your own voice and it's time to make space.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:22):**  I think that there's this idea that, oh, as long as we like hire women in our companies  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:26):**  and make jobs for women that somehow that is feminism and that is creating gender equality  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:31):**  and things like that.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:32):**  And I think it's actually about more than that.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:33):**  It's about taking a step back in some ways and actually opening up that space for women  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:38):**  who are doing this work and who are doing it more quietly to step into a space of not  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:44):**  necessarily recognition, but like a space of being able to shine in the work that they're  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:48):**  doing.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:49):**  I don't know if in the UK you have this concept called mansplaining that we have here in the  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:53):**  US.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:54):**  It's baffling the people that talk to me about the food system, the men that at the farmer's  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:59):**  market want to explain the food system to me and I have to stop them and say, I teach  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:04):**  this at a university.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:05):**  I don't need you to explain it to me.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:08):**  Stop and listen.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:09):**  Like know that the women around you have an amazing amount to say and amazing amount of  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:13):**  wisdom and knowledge and create that space is one is one huge piece.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:19):**  And then provide allyship.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:21):**  We all know convening here how much power there's in this room and the amazing work  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:25):**  that's being done by women around the world.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:28):**  There's an issue around women trying to make that understood by men and what women need  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:34):**  are their male allies to make that understood to other men.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:39):**  We need men who are on board and who get it to be schooling the people around them, the  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:45):**  men around them that are still living in the dark ages around what all this means and what  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:50):**  they're not seeing in the world.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:53):**  And that kind of allyship is going to be really crucial.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:55):**  Just be quiet and listen and then speak out to your brotherhoods.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:01):**  Katie also spoke about the multiple pressures of expectation placed on small scale farmers  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:06):**  and why the current land tenure system makes this situation untenable.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:10):**  Her comments relate to the USA, but they could also apply to the UK and elsewhere.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:16):**  So we're in a situation here in the US.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:19):**  I mean, I could say a lot about this issue of land justice.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:21):**  There's a book that was just published by Food First, the Institute for Food Development  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:24):**  Policy called Land Justice, Reimagining Land, Food and the Commons in the United States.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:29):**  So it is US specific.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:31):**  But I think that the themes and the dialogue are certainly applicable across the world,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:36):**  and particularly in a place like Britain.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:37):**  There's a lot of dialogue around colonialism and race and class and things that I think  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:42):**  are really applicable to anywhere in the Western world.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:45):**  I wrote a chapter that looked at the issue of land access and land security and tenure  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:49):**  for the new farming generation.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:51):**  And we have this huge conundrum here that I'm sure is similar in Europe.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:55):**  The production value of land can never match the market value.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:59):**  So food production and farming, ecological farming will never support the land that it  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:04):**  needs to grow on.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:06):**  The market for ecologically grown products is inherently in areas where the land values  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:10):**  are the highest, all sorts of political layers to that, of course.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:13):**  But it makes farming really difficult because farmers really have very insecure land tenure.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:17):**  So essentially, this is the deal.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:18):**  We're expecting this new generation of farmers to make high risk, high cost, low return financial  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:26):**  commitments, which in a neoliberal economy that we are stuck in, we would never expect  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:31):**  anywhere else.

**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:00):**  And most importantly, the biggest thing that we're expecting globally is for small scale

**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:27):**  and all those things.

**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:36):**  And yet we're expecting them to solve all of these social and environmental crises that  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:40):**  we have.

**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:03):**  ways that actually make sense for them and that they actually have tenure on their land.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:08):**  That's a piece of the dialogue around land justice that I can bring.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:10):**  There's certainly a much larger political dialogue around indigenous land, around black

**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:25):**  connection to.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:27):**  So thank you to Katie and Katie.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:31):**  Abby, you were at the conference.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:35):**  What did you make of it?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:37):**  I had actually never been to a conference that was all women speaking.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:40):**  All of the many different stories the women were telling were really inspiring.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:47):**  So in a way, I guess it's like any great conference you go to, it was a really nourishing  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:53):**  experience.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:54):**  It was about how can we all work together to have a more diverse voice coming from the  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:01):**  farming world?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:03):**  Because there certainly are many women working in the farming world.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:06):**  How can that be more reflected in communications and in leadership roles?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:12):**  And in particular, they were asking, what does it look like for if you have a female  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:18):**  rancher?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:19):**  Okay.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:20):**  So Abby, for this is in the UK, a rancher is that's like somebody who has a lot of cows.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:28):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:29):**  Someone who has a lot of cows or sheep and they range over a large area.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:33):**  So there was a rancher there who's about my age and she was asking questions like, you  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:39):**  know, the reason she'd gone into ranching was after many years in the farming industry,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:44):**  she'd really gotten affinity with regenerative agriculture in terms of how she can use these  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:52):**  wonderful animals to regenerate land on a large scale.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:59):**  And also she has a real affinity with animals.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:04):**  And she was saying, what does it look like to manage animals in a more feminine way?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:10):**  Because for her, a lot of the people she'd seen managing animals did it in a very kind  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:14):**  of aggressive sort of taking charge of the animals.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:20):**  And for her, well, physically, you know, she wasn't in the position to really be doing  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:24):**  that.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:25):**  And so it's questions like that, like what are those differences?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:28):**  And she put it as like, what is a feminine land ethic?  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:31):**  My main takeaway is that there are already many exciting women working in the farming  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:38):**  world and the food world.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:41):**  And that we need to be more proactive about surfacing those voices.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:47):**  Thanks.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:50):**  And that's actually something that we take quite seriously when we're putting Farm  
**[0:22:54-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:54):**  Armour together, and we are about to start publishing some data about the diversity of  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:03):**  the people who make the show and the people who we have on air.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:08):**  It's been interesting to look at the data from the last few episodes.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:11):**  And sometimes we think we're doing a good job, but this is really actually holding ourselves  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:14):**  to account and saying, are we doing as well as we thought?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:18):**  And I think the answer is we can do a lot better.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:23):**  Yeah, agreed.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:27):**  We rely on supporters to keep the show alive.

**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:53):**  Joel Rodker is just at the start of this journey.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:56):**  And we'll be along with him for the ride, learning with him and sharing experiences  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:01):**  which I bet are oh so familiar to so many of you.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:06):**  Here's Joel to introduce himself and set the scene.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:10):**  My name's Joel.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:12):**  I'm setting up a market garden in Cambridgeshire, just outside Peterborough.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:18):**  I'm on an existing farm which is run by Stephen and Lynn Briggs.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:22):**  And they are arable farmers with some fruit, fruit tree agroforestry.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:30):**  They're opening up a farm shop soon.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:33):**  And I'm going to be growing the fresh produce for the shop.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:36):**  So that's hopefully going to include vegetables, herbs and flowers.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:42):**  So so far, I'm in the third week now and I'm only here two or three days a week.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:47):**  I have dug over 360 meters squared.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:52):**  It's pretty slow going.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:53):**  The soil is really amazing.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:56):**  It's very light, it's very fertile, but there's quite a lot of couch grass root in the soil.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:01):**  So I'm trying to get as much of that out as possible, which is heavy going.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:07):**  I can't really think of an alternative to digging it out of a fork.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:11):**  But I am probably going to cover some of the area with silage sheet just so I don't have  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:17):**  to worry about the weeds coming back until I get around to digging it.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:22):**  I'm getting lots of transplants in plugs from Delfland Nurseries because I haven't had time  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:28):**  to sow anything myself.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:30):**  So I've got lots of brassicas, some onions, spinach, a few other lettuces and things,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:38):**  which I am going to put in and have been putting in over the winter.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:44):**  Most of that won't need covering, shouldn't need covering.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:47):**  I guess at the moment, things that I'm a little bit concerned about are the lack of irrigation.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:52):**  We're still applying for an irrigation license.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:55):**  So there is a sort of temporary watering system set up, but it's not that efficient.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:02):**  I can use watering cans, but that takes quite a long time.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:05):**  So hopefully, given the time of year, it shouldn't be too dry, although it hasn't rained much  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:09):**  recently.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:11):**  I'm thinking about how I'm going to arrange the post-harvest infrastructure.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:16):**  That's quite a big job.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:17):**  I'm not quite sure where that's going to go and how that's going to be designed.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:23):**  And getting ready for sowing in spring, I guess, is another big challenge that I'm thinking  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:28):**  about what seeds I need to water, what crops I want.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:34):**  There's a lot of different things going on in my head at the moment, but I guess while  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:38):**  I'm digging out the couch grass, I've got a lot of time to think.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:42):**  So I can mull all those things over in my mind.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:46):**  And once I've dug enough ground to plant the plugs that I've bought, then I can maybe start  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:54):**  to look at some of the other infrastructure that needs doing.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:58):**  I guess the best thing so far has just been starting, because I've been thinking about  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:01):**  this for a long time, and to finally be setting everything out and doing what I've been thinking  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:10):**  about for a long time is quite hard to believe, actually.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:15):**  So that's a great feeling.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:17):**  Yesterday a friend came over and took some drone footage, and that was really nice to  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:22):**  see what I'd done so far and see all the beds laid out and see that I'd got all the straight  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:28):**  lines right and see the rows of plants.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:32):**  To see the plants in the ground and doing well, that's a really nice feeling.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:38):**  So hopefully by next spring there'll be a lot more of that.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:41):**  It's very early days, but hopefully there'll be lots more to share.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:47):**  And I'm looking forward to learning and I'm looking forward to a productive next season.

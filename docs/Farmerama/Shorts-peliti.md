**[0:00:00-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:00):**  The seed came as an idea to Panagiotis Aenatoudis, who is the founder and the coordinator of  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:18):**  the community about 20 or 25 years ago, when he realized that he wasn't able to find all  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:25):**  the varieties of, let's say, corn that he used to eat as a child.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:29):**  Suddenly he's 20, 30 years old and he realizes that there's only one type of corn variety  
**[0:00:36-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:36):**  left and he started wondering what happened, where are all the other varieties.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:44):**  On his own he started traveling around Greece, meeting people in villages, searching and  
**[0:00:49-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:49):**  gathering all seed varieties in order to save them somehow.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:00:58):**  This has gradually led into the creation of a huge seed archive, which needs a lot of  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:05):**  resources to be maintained, although the purpose is not at all creating a seed archive or seed  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:11):**  bank because seeds are meant to be grown and cultivated and able to evolve.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:17):**  And this is one aspect that maybe we should shed some light on, that seed banks, although  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:25):**  people use it as an argument or politicians use it as an argument against the necessity  
**[0:01:29-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:29):**  of seed saving, are not a solution on their own because of what I said before.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:37):**  Seeds are not meant to be kept in a refrigerator dug under the earth, but they should be able  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:46):**  to evolve, develop together with us and together with climate, together with the soil and the  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:53):**  earth.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:55):**  Because they can do it, whereas the industrial varieties cannot do it.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:01:59):**  So right now, PELIDI is consisted of 20 local groups all over Europe and also there is a  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:06):**  group in Sofia, Bulgaria.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:10):**  We are all volunteers right now and we have, during the past years PELIDI is actively involved  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:23):**  and networked with other groups of seed savers around the world.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:28):**  PELIDI is all about saving seeds and keeping seeds free.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:34):**  Do you think that organizations like PELIDI also do some sort of politics as well?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:41):**  Traditional varieties is the reason why, is what helped us, is what our food was based  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:47):**  on until very recently, solely, exclusively on traditional seed varieties until 60-70  
**[0:02:53-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:02:53):**  years ago, when the big industry came and provided farmers with new improved varieties  
**[0:03:01-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:01):**  that were high yield but are in dispense, linked to, well I'll go over it again, well  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:13):**  the big industry provided farmers with high yield varieties but that go hand in hand with  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:21):**  agrochemicals and soil exhaustion.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:24):**  Because they have a limited genetic database and they cannot survive natural attacks.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:28):**  So on the other hand, traditional varieties have a broad genetic base and they cannot  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:34):**  adjust to climate change, they cannot survive pests and diseases by evolving.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:41):**  They might not be as productive as the industrial ones but it has been proven that if a farmer,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:47):**  and this is what's important for local economy and it's also a huge political issue, if a  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:03:57):**  farmer is able to keep his own seed, which is not always easy, you know seed legislation  
**[0:04:03-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:03):**  is not always very in favour of accessibility of seeds, well if a farmer is allowed to keep  
**[0:04:14-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:14):**  its own seed, which means that he doesn't have to use fertilisers and pesticides, agrochemicals  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:25):**  in general, and can sell its products directly, he can have a totally viable farming business  
**[0:04:33-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:33):**  and even earn ten times more than a farmer that buys seed, buys pesticides and herbs  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:43):**  and fertilisers and buys through intermediaries.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:47):**  Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to combine the cultivation of traditional seed varieties  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:04:54):**  with soil health, to have a way to prove that growing traditional seeds compared to conventional  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:02):**  or industrial seeds correlates with soil health, correlates with human health.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:11):**  There are a lot of claims and actually it is from a cultural perspective it's very interesting  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:17):**  to have a diversified rural landscape, to use our ancestors seeds and so on, but wouldn't  
**[0:05:24-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:24):**  it be also interesting to connect that with some very urgent challenges like soil conservation,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:35):**  public health and so on.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:36):**  Is there something like that going on as a process in Peliti, this type of connection?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:44):**  I know that apart from Peliti there has been recent scientific research going all over  
**[0:05:49-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:49):**  the world about the connection of health, the condition of soil with microorganisms  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:05:58):**  that exist in the soil, how agrochemicals have decreased significantly, the populations  
**[0:06:05-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:05):**  of microorganisms and how this affects the way that the plants absorb the nutrients from  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:13):**  the soil and how these nutrients are absorbed by our body and the damage that all the agrochemicals  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:19):**  have caused to our bodies, microorganisms and our bodies, microorganisms.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:28):**  So Peliti right now, Peliti is a community that is trying to focus mainly on enlarging  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:44):**  the number of people, raise awareness and grow a network, a community of people that  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:51):**  support each other in seed saving, having in mind all these aspects and the ultimate  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:06:57):**  one is our own health apart from the political one or the economical one for farmers, the  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:03):**  health issue is something that connects everyone.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:07):**  It would be very interesting if we could focus on this aspect and for the moment we are mainly  
**[0:07:15-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:15):**  trying to focus on, let's say, encourage farmers and professional farmers to grow more of local  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:27):**  varieties, traditional varieties and be able to improve them the way our ancestors did  
**[0:07:32-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:32):**  for many years so that more professional farmers prefer them for their benefits and gradually  
**[0:07:41-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:41):**  this might lead into creating a network of committed professional farmers that face their  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:49):**  farms as an ecosystem of soil and plants and people that each one supports each other for  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:07:56):**  a better life.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:01):**  So soil is an indispensable part of growing food so it's essential to have it in mind.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:13):**  During class here Peliti with the support of forums is working towards a direction of  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:19):**  affecting seed policy so that traditional varieties can be accessible legally.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:23):**  I don't know if you know what the situation is like with the legislation of the legal  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:31):**  framework right now.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:32):**  The legal framework doesn't allow at this moment, it is said in a way that selling traditional  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:36):**  varieties is not allowed because it demands uniformity and stability in order to sell  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:44):**  seeds.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:45):**  So that uniformity and stability is something that only industrial varieties can achieve.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:50):**  Traditional varieties cannot do it because they evolve as we said.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:08:55):**  So it's a very crucial issue and our main efforts right now are focused, a big part  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:02):**  of our efforts, of Peliti's efforts is focused on this.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:06):**  And we also have an annual seed festival every year, a week after Easter where people from  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:14):**  all over Greece and now from all over the world come and exchange seeds.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:20):**  It's an opportunity to meet people, we're doing workshops, people exchange experiences,  
**[0:09:25-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:25):**  not only on seed issues but on land, access to land and new farming practices.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:36):**  And we learn from one another, it's like a community that each one teaches the other.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:42):**  So it's crucial.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:43):**  Well, as with all collective efforts, when people, different people gather, we have differences  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:09:56):**  but having this common ground in mind, we try to find the connections that unite us  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:03):**  and step on it and evolve and continue.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:07):**  You seem to give a lot of emphasis on the human to human relationships and interaction,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:13):**  direct communication, knowledge exchange.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:17):**  I think the motto of Peliti is from hand to hand and from soul to soul.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:21):**  From hand to hand and from heart to heart.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:23):**  Do you think there is space for new technologies in these type of connections?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:29):**  New technologies offer some really interesting opportunities for connecting with one another  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:35):**  between places that no one could have imagined just a few years ago.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:40):**  Do you think that there is space for new technologies to help catalyze this strive for seed freedom,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:50):**  for food democracy, for solidarity based land use and so on?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:10:59):**  I think that new technologies are necessary, especially now that the food industry is so  
**[0:11:08-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:08):**  aggressively addressing farmers and almost dominating over the food production system.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:21):**  So if we want to create something different, we have to use new technologies to facilitate  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:29):**  what we do and our purpose.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:32):**  But we should educate ourselves, we should educate farmers.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:36):**  There are applications that you can use to have information necessary even for farming,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:45):**  but it's necessary to use technology that facilitates communication with each other  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:55):**  within the country because we are in different parts of Greece.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:11:57):**  So it's necessary to use the simplest form of internet communication.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:05):**  It's necessary.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:06):**  For instance, we could use technologies to improve our seed archive, monitor and control  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:12):**  it somehow so that other people can easily have access to what we have, maybe create  
**[0:12:18-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:18):**  a commons of our seed archive so that other people can share.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:26):**  It depends on how you use it, whether you cause good or harm.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory-peliti#t=0:12:29):**  So it's a tool in our hands and I think it's necessary for us to use it effectively.

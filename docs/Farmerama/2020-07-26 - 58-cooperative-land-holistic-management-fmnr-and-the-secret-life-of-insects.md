**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:00:22):**  to a more holistic way of farming and making a living from marginal land.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:00:27):**  We learn how a simple system of nurturing chopped down trees back to life is restoring

**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:32):**  So we started off on an allotment site in Redbridge in East London.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:37):**  We've had no experience with farming whatsoever, or even growing or gardening, like anything  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:44):**  of that kind of sort.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:45):**  I grew a bean once and that was basically about it.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:48):**  It started off as just a bit of a hobby.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:51):**  We'd been doing that for maybe about a year without really...  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:57):**  We wasn't selling, it was just a hobby.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:02:59):**  And then as we started putting some stuff online of what we were growing, we started  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:04):**  getting quite a bit of contacting from different people, lots of chefs asking how do we get  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:10):**  hold of your product.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:11):**  We didn't really know, never even considered this as a career.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:20):**  We decided just to start sending to these chefs around and then it kind of just grew  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:25):**  from that.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:26):**  I guess like in London, there's quite a close network of small restaurants.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:31):**  So I guess one would go to the other, I've got this stuff from so and so, and then it  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:36):**  kind of just grew that way.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:37):**  Yeah, it just kind of grew with us not really knowing what we were doing and just completely  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:43):**  winning it, which I don't know, I'd probably say we still are a little bit now.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:47):**  But yeah, I guess it was like we never really intended to do this.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:50):**  We just knew that we wanted to be outdoors.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:53):**  We knew that we wanted to do something that was a bit closer to nature and that we were  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:03:56):**  kind of both rethinking like kind of an office-based life.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:02):**  And yeah, just kind of ended up organically, I guess, like falling into it and just learning  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:09):**  as we go.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:10):**  We're still learning, we're still making like a ridiculous amount of mistakes, but learning  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:15):**  from them as we go.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:17):**  Where we were growing, we didn't have a contract, we didn't have a tenancy.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:22):**  So with that, we had no security.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:24):**  And why would you put kind of your investment and your heart into something knowing that  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:30):**  it could just be taken away from you at any moment?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:33):**  And there was kind of like some talks that were maybe making us think that that was kind  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:39):**  of the way that things were going to head.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:41):**  But this is like, this is such a rife issue within like cities in particular of like people  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:45):**  growing in community gardens or with social enterprises or small growing projects that  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:51):**  they're all on borrowed land and they're all on unsecured land.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:04:55):**  It's just not fair that if there's a generation of farmers and growers that are, you know,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:01):**  the kind of older demographic that we often talk about who own the land and have that  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:06):**  security.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:07):**  It's just not fair that we don't get that as well.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:10):**  But we were at the Oxford Real Farming Conference and this was where we met the ELC.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:14):**  But a talk that we went to before, there was a young person talking about the want for  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:21):**  like land and to be able to own the land and farmer who was a lot older than us owned land  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:29):**  and had said like, I don't know why you guys also hung up on owning land.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:33):**  And it's just like, just how dare you?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:35):**  Like it's that security that we're after that knowing that we can put our energy into something  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:41):**  like working with the land.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:42):**  It's not just a, you know, I'm going to get set up in like a couple of months.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:46):**  It's all good to go.

**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:50):**  It takes a lot of energy and effort.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:52):**  So not a lot of financial reward, but you know, a lot of like inner reward.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:05:58):**  So that was really important for us to like get that security and to know that like the  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:05):**  place that we were working on and the place that we were putting our hearts into wasn't  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:09):**  just going to be taken away from us.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:12):**  So then like the ELCs were kind of like a lifeline.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:17):**  Like we went to one of their talks and they explained the whole setup about access to  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:23):**  land, you know, like the legal legwork, et cetera.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:27):**  We went to the talk twice because we didn't believe it the first time.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:31):**  It's a bit of a surprise to find out there is actually an option out there because again,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:36):**  like I remember another one of the talks we went to there, there was a young person speaking  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:41):**  about how they got into farming and we at first we thought that was the talk to pay  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:45):**  attention to, but it just turns out they inherited the land from their parents.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:49):**  So it's kind of like it was a very inspirational that one.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:53):**  But yeah, the ELC one of saying like they run this scheme where they buy portions of  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:06:57):**  land, split into like affordable sizes.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:02):**  And then yeah, yeah, I guess we didn't just took it on from them and started getting in  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:06):**  touch with the ELC and then yeah, ended up here.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:11):**  We actually just never thought that it would really be an option for us when we had kind  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:15):**  of come to terms that like the social enterprise we were running had had no future and that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:20):**  we had to leave it.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:21):**  But our plan was just, you know, right, well, we're going to have to go back into office  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:25):**  jobs.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:26):**  We're going to have to try and like earn as much money as we can.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:29):**  So then maybe we can try and buy either a small patch of land and live near it because  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:34):**  there's no way that we're going to buy a piece of land that actually has a house on it.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:37):**  So yeah, like it's just an incredible thing that the ELC are doing in like opening up  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:42):**  land for people that come from backgrounds that just don't have the luxury of inheriting  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:47):**  it.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:49):**  So the relationship between us and the ELC is really good.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:51):**  It's very personal there and they're involved enough from a like looking out for us perspective,  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:57):**  but not from a they're watching over us.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:07:59):**  They feel like our aunties and uncles.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:02):**  Yeah, I mean, they were more, more interested in our wellbeing during this time rather than,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:09):**  you know, like the actual farm inside of it, which was nice.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:14):**  Took a lot of pressure off of it.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:15):**  But I think that's like, it's really nice to know that we have someone like looking  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:21):**  out for us, particularly, you know, we don't come from farming backgrounds.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:25):**  We don't come from countryside or rural backgrounds.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:28):**  We don't really understand how things work out here.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:32):**  It's a very different way of living.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:33):**  It's very different kind of, I guess, culture and there's different politics.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:40):**  We just don't really know how to like navigate with that.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:42):**  We've probably come in a little bit naive with like our London ways and Essex ways of  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:48):**  just like, but yeah, knowing that we have like ELC that have our back, that can help  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:53):**  us with like what our rights are here and what we are allowed to do and what we're not  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:08:58):**  allowed to do and like kind of some of the law stuff that we just don't have any clue  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:01):**  about and it's all incredibly scary.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:04):**  But to know that we can reach out to them and ask them those questions is like, we feel  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:08):**  like we're in a really fortunate position.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:10):**  You know, if we had gone and done this on our own, I just realistically, I just don't  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:15):**  really think we would have been able to.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:17):**  Because when we moved here, when we got our caravan, we were supposed to get it put in  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:21):**  place in December and then it just rained every single day from like November.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:28):**  But then that just held us up quite a lot in terms of being able to move here.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:31):**  So we didn't actually get like our home moved until I think it was like mid February because  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:37):**  the ground was just so wet and so ridiculous.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:41):**  So I think that just held us back quite a lot.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:45):**  Yeah, I guess it meant that we couldn't just stay here.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:49):**  So it meant like having to come from London each time.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:09:52):**  I mean, I'd say despite all of like those earlier struggles, like we were still enjoying  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:01):**  it and I think it kind of like just like was like confirming that we've made the right  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:07):**  choice to escape the city office life.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:11):**  I guess like if you used to work in an office and have a real struggle, rubbish kind of  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:17):**  day, you get home and you don't really feel rewarded from it.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:21):**  Whereas this, like you struggle and it's a pain at the time.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:25):**  But once you've done it, you kind of, I don't know, that kind of like self-worth, you kind  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:30):**  of like look at it and you kind of feel more proud of what you're doing.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:33):**  It's a lot more like a visual reward with this kind of lifestyle.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:38):**  Just reminding yourself that you can do it and like we are capable and we are able of  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:44):**  doing it.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:45):**  I think for me, like as well, that I spoke about it before, but like I suffer with like  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:52):**  quite a lot of anxiety and depression and like I second guess myself a lot whether I  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:10:56):**  can actually do stuff and put myself down a lot.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:11:01):**  Whereas I think being here and like doing stuff and getting on with stuff, like I'm  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:11:06):**  building up a bit more like resilience and like belief in like what I can do.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:11:10):**  And I'd say the same for like you as well.

**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:23:44):**  about is FMNR.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:23:47):**  That is what we do sustainably to grow the food that we eat.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:23:54):**  And FMNR is just a simple approach and a simple technique that we use in a way that we allow  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:04):**  the indigenous trees and tree stumps to regenerate.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:08):**  We prune them and we enable them to grow into the trees that we would like to see.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:15):**  And basically this is having trees on farm, which most of the times most of the farmers  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:25):**  are thinking about getting that smart farm.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:29):**  But we are talking about having trees on farm because that's the only way we can have trees  
**[0:24:34-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:34):**  exist and then we also have our food grown in a proper manner that we can all coexist.

**[0:24:50-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:50):**  It is very clean as we see it, but with FMNR we are saying give it a chance to regenerate.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:24:59):**  And when it regenerates, it's like that image three, we can get few shrubs, few thick grasses,  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:07):**  few tree stumps trying to resurface.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:10):**  And when they resurface, we can manage to have some trees that can try growing.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:16):**  When we prune once, twice, and thrice, we can be able to get a few trees that can be  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:23):**  nurtured into the nature of the trees that we would want to have.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:28):**  If we want for fuel as wood, it's available.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:32):**  If we want big trees for construction, it's also available.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:35):**  If we need any other kind of trees, it is available.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:39):**  And it's a technology that works mainly with our indigenous tree species.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:45):**  So those men you see are trying to prune the trees so that we get those taller trees like  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:52):**  you can see them there.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:25:55):**  So basically FMNR is that as I have indicated.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:00):**  And of course we prune these regularly and regularly.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:07):**  So that is Tony.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:10):**  Tony is a champion of FMNR.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:14):**  He's from Australia and we work closely together.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:18):**  He got an award on right livelihood.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:21):**  FMNR was awarded as a right livelihood approach to sustainable development.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:27):**  So we believe it works.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:29):**  We have tested it.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:30):**  It is simple.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:31):**  It's low cost.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:33):**  It's sustainable.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:34):**  Possible.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:35):**  And reversible to reverse the gear of the global warming that we have.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:41):**  We believe and we already know that we are in a changing atmosphere when we talk about  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:46):**  seasons.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:47):**  Most of our farmers in Uganda have been used to planting in March and harvesting in June,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:53):**  July.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:54):**  But this time even in May it is not yet raining.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:26:59):**  So that means there is a lot that is going on in seasons.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:03):**  And I believe also with us the seasons are changing.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:07):**  When we talk about increased pests due to global warming, they are increasing.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:11):**  We see new pests every day.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:14):**  And all those challenges that we see available, the changes, we have decline in soil fertility  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:22):**  and very many of those.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:25):**  But we come in as FMNR advocates.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:28):**  We come in as FMNR champions to say that we can use simple techniques to be able to rehabilitate,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:38):**  to be able to increase our land productivity using a simple approach as I have talked about  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:45):**  it in the beginning.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:49):**  Comparing our statistics, we realized from one of the studies that we did in West Africa,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:27:57):**  you can use 40 U.S. dollars to nurture the trees on farm per hectare with FMNR.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:08):**  Using and planting new trees, you need 8,000 U.S. dollars on a farm, meaning FMNR is still  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:17):**  cheaper.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:18):**  That is what we are saying.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:21):**  It's very easy to give an example, but it's very difficult to become one.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:27):**  Yes, we are here talking.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:29):**  We need to change.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:31):**  We need to work out something.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:33):**  We are giving examples, but what are we going to do ourselves?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:36):**  So I'm here to tell us that we can do something.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:43):**  Myself when I learned about the simplicity of FMNR, I mobilized several farmers around  
**[0:28:49-0:28:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:49):**  the country and we started practicing the FMNR network, the FMNR networking, and practically  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:28:59):**  we have rehabilitated several hectares of land in millions.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:04):**  So you that is here, what are you going to do?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:09):**  Are you going to start learning by doing, as we say, with the approach?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:16):**  I've been told, and it is a reality, that there is no school you go to learn riding  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:23):**  a bicycle.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:24):**  If you want to ride a bicycle, you get on it, you ride it, you fall down, the next time  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:30):**  you will ride it better.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:32):**  So we say that as FMNR, that we do not have to go to school and start doing everything.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:40):**  But we need to do to learn by doing.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:43):**  And with that, we will perfect it and perfect it and become experts.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:48):**  So there are several benefits that we can get from FMNR.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:52):**  That is one of the honey products that we got from some of the farmers in Ofaka, that  
**[0:29:57-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:29:57):**  is West Nile region of Uganda, which we harvested from some FMNR farms and sites.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:08):**  We have fuel.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:09):**  In Uganda, most of our farmers use wood as fuel.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:16):**  We use it for construction purposes.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:21):**  Farmers are earning more from selling of the products from FMNR.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:29):**  From the simple illustrations, that is how a tree was cut, some of the farmers do bush  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:35):**  burning.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:36):**  So if there is bush burning around from the farms, that is how the field may look like.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:44):**  But if you look in that corner, there is a shoot that is coming up.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:50):**  And that is what we need.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:51):**  And when that shoot grows to some level, we start planning.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:30:55):**  And in a twinkle of an eye, we have a great forest.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:00):**  That is a picture before FMNR and below is when FMNR had been done.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:07):**  That was taken in West Africa.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:10):**  So it is possible, it is reversible, we can do it together.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:15):**  That is part of the team and the farmers that we work with.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:20):**  And we are working with them in one of the projects where a forest, a natural forest  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:31:26):**  was cut down, and we are working with them to do FMNR in that place so that we can be

**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:34:40):**  things.

**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:34:45):**  The numbers of insects which migrate seem to be really quite incredible, considering  
**[0:34:51-0:35:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:34:51):**  that you see the great arrivals of swifts and swallows into the UK, but you don't always  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:00):**  see these numbers of insects because they're often far too small to notice.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:05):**  You might notice the painted lady butterflies coming in on the red antlers.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:09):**  There's been some reports about really big ears.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:12):**  But then a lot of the insects that are migrating, we found them, we found during my PhD, the  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:21):**  vast majority of the insects migrating are in fact flies.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:24):**  That's a really, really exciting finding because that's very new.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:31):**  So the effect that flies have could be massive on the ecosystem.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:36):**  Also there are some little things like when we went to the Pyrenees, we expected to see  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:42):**  the painted ladies and red antler butterflies because they're the known migrants.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:46):**  And then we saw tens of thousands of cabbage white butterflies going up over the passes.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:52):**  And that was quite interesting because everyone, well, at least I seem to think they were quite  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:35:57):**  sedentary creatures.

**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:04):**  And so the numbers of the insects also seems to be massive.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:08):**  So we were seeing, as I said, tens of thousands of these butterflies.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:14):**  But when we went to Cyprus, we saw millions of these painted lady butterflies coming into  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:20):**  land.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:21):**  But the flies were by far the most numerous.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:24):**  We had tens and tens of nearly 50 million flies making landfall across Cyprus.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:31):**  So there's been some published data on how many insects are moving around just Southern  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:37):**  England.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:38):**  And using these amazing entomological radars, these insect radars, which fire a beam up  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:45):**  into the sky and then they count the number of insects passing across this beam.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:50):**  And that research showed that in any given average year, three and a half trillion insects  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:55):**  migrate across Southern England, which is an incredible amount.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:36:58):**  And this has loads of potential applications as well.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:03):**  So when we are in Cyprus, we saw many hover flies crossing oceans covered in pollen.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:12):**  And this long distance pollen transfer is really, really important because it allows  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:18):**  the gene flow between populations of plants, which although they're the same species,  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:24):**  are geographically isolated from each other.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:27):**  And because of these migratory insects, it allows these populations to be connected.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:34):**  This allows gene flow between them.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:36):**  And then also this gene flow increases the fitness of the plant populations.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:42):**  If they're declining, a new gene could come and rescue them.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:45):**  And overall, it increases yield.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:47):**  And this is really important for farming, of course.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:49):**  So like crops, crops being hundreds of kilometers apart are actually connected.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:37:56):**  The differences in genetic diversity or increasing genetic diversity of the pollen they receive.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:01):**  One of the main reasons for insect decline is habitat loss and also pesticides along  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:09):**  with climate change.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:11):**  And they seem to be the three main things.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:15):**  And the habitat loss and pesticides seem to be quite easy fixes.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:19):**  And I think it's the farmers which are in the best position to do this.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:23):**  And I think it's also by a few studies which looked at the benefits of wildflower strips

**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:38):**  And it's not just pollination as well.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:41):**  It's things like pest control.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:43):**  And so another study that my supervisor, PhD supervisor Carl Watson did was look at just  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:49):**  two species of hoverfly.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:51):**  And he found in just southern England, he found that they would eat six trillion aphids  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:38:58):**  in a year, which is like 6000 tons worth of aphids, which is an incredible amount.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:04):**  Two species of hoverflies eating what is about 20% of the early spring population of aphids.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:11):**  And there are far, far more hoverflies which eat the aphids coming into the UK that are  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:16):**  migratory.

**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:23):**  So having these wildflower strips along the edges of farms.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:26):**  And even there is an experiment I think showing that having wildflower strips in the center  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:33):**  of fields as well was really, really useful because that just allows the insects to get  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-58-cooperative-land-holistic-management-farmer-managed-natural-regeneration-and-the-secret-life-of-insects#t=0:39:38):**  to more of the crop.

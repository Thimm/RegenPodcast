**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmer Armour. As we hit the hungry gap, we know many of the farmers and growers  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:07):**  out there are under more pressure than ever to provide food for your local communities  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:12):**  and to rapidly find new markets for your produce, all whilst being concerned with the health  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:17):**  of those around you. So we wanted to take a moment to say, as ever, we and so many others  
**[0:00:23-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:23):**  are grateful for the work you do. Sowing seeds, nurturing the soil, caring for animals and  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:31):**  managing the land so that everyone can eat. Thank you. Farmer Armour is made for you.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:38):**  This month we bring you the final deep dive episode from a session at the Oxford Real  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:42):**  Farming Conference, which took place in January. This year we were delighted to be ROFC's  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:48):**  official media partner.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:53):**  With life as we know it having ground to a halt, many of us are shell shocked. Food,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:00:59):**  health and the wellbeing of the people we love, work with and live alongside have become  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:04):**  our top priorities. It's as if we always knew deep down these are the most important  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:10):**  things in life, but somehow this wasn't clear to us before. Maybe, just maybe, the  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:17):**  economic system was pulling us in the wrong direction. The economy is a construct created  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:23):**  to support society, so if it feels like it's not serving us, then maybe it's time to  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:30):**  take another look. What form does our economy need to take if we want to support a regenerative  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:37):**  farming future? We hear from a biologist philosopher and then an economist with their visions of  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:44):**  what a new economy might look like. And we get some very practical on the ground accounts  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:50):**  from food producers who are experimenting with regenerative economic models.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:01:56):**  The dominant economic paradigm of today is often described as neoliberalism. Firstly,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:03):**  we hear from biologist, author and co-founder of ROFC, Colin Tudge. He helps us to define  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:10):**  what this means and shares his vision for an economy that supports regenerative farming.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:16):**  The present economic model is that of neoliberalism. And the point about neoliberalism is not simply  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:23):**  that it is capitalist, it is capitalist, but that's not the point. The point is that neoliberalism  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:30):**  is a specific form of capitalism based on the idea that A, you must at all costs maximise  
**[0:02:37-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:37):**  your profits. B, that you must do so in competition with everybody else. C, that competition somehow  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:46):**  leads to efficiency. D, that you have this thing called the hypothetical global free  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:54):**  market, which basically means that everyone should compete in a kind of no rules free  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:02:59):**  for all. And somehow out of that melee is supposed to come a world that's tolerable  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:06):**  to live in. Except of course that the real neoliberal doesn't have a conception of what  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:13):**  a world that's good to live in actually looks like. The real neoliberalism simply says that  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:19):**  whatever turns out as a result of this melee is reality. So as they say, get used to it.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:26):**  And that is frankly insane. There's basically two models of farming out there in the modern  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:32):**  world. And one that is prevails, which is the one that's kind of part of the neoliberal  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:38):**  economy says that, and this is a quote really, agriculture is just a business like any other.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:46):**  And in the neoliberal economy, all businesses are conceived as enterprises that are there  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:03:54):**  to maximise profit, maximise wealth. So the neoliberal model of agriculture says that  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:00):**  agriculture is there to maximise wealth. Whereas the second model says, no, actually the real  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:07):**  point of farming is to provide everybody with good food and provide good jobs and look after  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:14):**  the biosphere, duty of care. Ask the question then, what kind of farming do we really need?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:21):**  I came up with a concept about 12 years ago, something like that, of enlightened agriculture.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:28):**  Enlightened agriculture is based on two very big established principles. One of which is  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:33):**  agroecology, which says you should treat farms as ecosystems. And the other is food sovereignty,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:41):**  which says that all societies should have control of their own food supply. Now, if  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:46):**  you follow both those things through, you finish up by saying, look, we need farming  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:51):**  that is very diverse, ecologically sound, et cetera, et cetera. We need low input. In  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:04:57):**  other words, it shouldn't be this big oil dependent thing. Low input actually in the  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:01):**  end means be as organic as possible. If you've got those two things, it's going to be a very  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:08):**  complex system. If you've got a very complex system, it's got to be skills intensive, plenty  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:13):**  of good farmers. It doesn't mean plenty of slaves, it means plenty of skilled farmers.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:18):**  And if you put all those things together, you say there is no real advantage in scale  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:21):**  up, not if it's complicated and lots of people working together. So you really need the farms  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:27):**  and the units to be on the whole small to medium sized. That model of a farm is the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:33):**  complete opposite of what we actually have, which is based on the sort of neoliberal model.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:40):**  Because what we have is farming that is trying to be as productive as possible, but at the  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:45):**  same time as cheap as possible, given that oil prices are adjusted to make sure that  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:51):**  it's affordable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So you have a maximization of machinery,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:05:58):**  maximum use of industrial chemicals because they're very profitable. And the big machines  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:05):**  don't do complexity, so you have a very simple system. And they like to be used on the large  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:11):**  scale, that's the most economic. So you finish up with farms which are monocultural on the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:17):**  largest possible scale, very high input, a complete opposite of what you should be doing  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:23):**  if you're really interested in keeping the world in good heart and providing everybody  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:27):**  with good food, the complete opposite. So what kind of economy would deliver enlightened  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:35):**  agriculture, small mix units, et cetera? I think, and lots of other beginning people  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:40):**  are beginning to think or do think, that you really need what I'm calling a tripartite  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:45):**  mixed economy where you have private ownership and you have some public ownership where it's  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:51):**  appropriate and you have community ownership. And whereas, well, community ownership does  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:06:58):**  exist, but it's not drawn attention to, more and more people are saying community ownership  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:04):**  is the way forward, community owned farms, community owned everything basically. Of course,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:10):**  the community is a wonderful compromise between personal gain and all that, and it can work  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:17):**  democratically. So that's what we should be going for, the tripartite mixed economy.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:22):**  The second great principle is that every enterprise, however it's owned, should be conceived as  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:29):**  a social enterprise. In other words, its agenda, its purpose is not simply to maximise profit.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:36):**  Its agenda, its purpose is to, well, make the world a better place, which I would say  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:41):**  contribute towards the convivial society, contribute towards the wellbeing of the biosphere.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:48):**  Then it's a social enterprise, that's good. When it comes to things that are privately  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:52):**  owned, just investing in things because they're maximally profitable is not helpful. It doesn't  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:07:58):**  make for a good world. So what one should practise is what a good friend of ours who's  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:04):**  at this conference calls the positive investment. And positive investment is an extension of  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:12):**  the original idea of ethical investment. Ethical investment tends to mean that you don't invest  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:18):**  in things you don't like, whereas positive investment means that you only invest in things  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:23):**  that you definitely do like. And I think if everybody that had spare money invested only  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:28):**  in things that they really think are good and had good reasons for thinking that they're  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:31):**  good, then I think you're well on the way to creating a better world.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:37):**  There are critics of this kind of general view who say you're a communist. That criticism  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:44):**  simply doesn't make sense. Private ownership definitely has a role. There are other people  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:49):**  who I know quite well, good Marxists, who hate the mixed economy for the totally opposite  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:53):**  reason. You shouldn't have any private ownership in there at all. Well, this in both cases  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:08:58):**  is treating the economy, which is merely a tool, means to an end, as if it were not simply  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:05):**  an ideology, which it is, but as if it was some kind of fundamental moral principle,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:10):**  which it absolutely is not. The other kind of criticism that's aimed at the kind of things  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:15):**  I'm saying, and I've had it thrown at me hundreds of times over the years, is that what you're  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:20):**  proposing is unrealistic. The bigger point is that the present course of action, the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:26):**  present where the world is run, is wrecking the entire world in all ways. You know, the

**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:39):**  How could that be realistic? How can we prefer that to a system that could deliver conviviality,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:47):**  could look after our fellow creatures? There's a lot of people, including a lot of small

**[0:09:59-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:09:59):**  world. And what most of them need is not to do things differently, but a sympathetic society,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:10:10):**  people who will actually appreciate what they do and buy what they do. If we seriously care

**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:10:23):**  of the present, what you might call oligarchy. We cannot afford to leave it in the hands  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:10:28):**  of present day governments, or of the corporates with whom they work very closely, or of the

**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:10:39):**  and farming into our own hands.

**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:12):**  the City of London as an accountant and a banker, but I left that career after 10 years  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:20):**  during the dot-com bubble when it burst, because I'd become completely disillusioned with the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:25):**  ethics and the lack of any real positive social purpose. And then I spent the next 10 years  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:33):**  actually in business, working on sustainable businesses of various kinds. And then from  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:39):**  there I became an economist specializing in how we can change the system to become more  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:43):**  sustainable. And this leads me to career number four, which is to try and set up a regional  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:49):**  mutual bank that actually is a sustainable new economy bank.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:11:53):**  We've had a 40-year experiment of this highly market-based, deregulated, finance-driven  
**[0:12:01-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:01):**  economy and it has led us towards an ecological collapse, huge levels of social inequality,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:09):**  and actually even economies that are not even in their own terms performing very well. So  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:14):**  it is absolutely time to re-examine that system and to try something new.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:19):**  So I guess one of the biggest failings of neoliberalism, and one that's recognized to  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:24):**  be fair by plenty of establishment figures and economists and politicians, is that it  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:31):**  does really badly in understanding environmental and social impacts, whether positive or negative.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:37):**  It's really hard to get those priced into a market in a way that means that we fully  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:43):**  account for all of the environmental and social impacts of the way the economy works. Neoliberalism  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:48):**  has basically failed on that question. And Professor Stern, Nicholas Stern, who ran a  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:12:56):**  review for the government in the UK, described climate change as the biggest market failure  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:03):**  the world has ever seen. But it's not just about climate, of course, it's about biodiversity  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:08):**  and we're in the sixth mass extinction, it's about the loss of habitats, it's about water,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:13):**  it's about soil, it's about everything, right? It's about our interaction with nature and  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:18):**  we've really messed it up disastrously. I think food and farming and anything to do  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:24):**  with our interactions with nature are absolutely at the frontier of where neoliberalism has  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:30):**  gone wrong. So I think that farmers and growers and producers and people who are looking after  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:36):**  habitats, they know this and they feel it and they understand how the system is absolutely  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:43):**  getting in the way of them doing the right thing. Economics is not natural sciences.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:49):**  Economics is about humans and how we interact with each other, nothing more, nothing less.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:54):**  And therefore it's a social science. It is not a natural phenomenon. All markets are  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:13:59):**  ultimately designed by society. We set the rules and so if we don't think we're getting  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:05):**  good outcomes then it is up to us and it's within our power to set new rules for those  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:09):**  markets and that's what we need to do. I think possibly some of the ingredients that we'd  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:14):**  need to change this system include having a plan, which is a national plan. And I don't  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:21):**  mean central planning by that, I just mean an understanding that says well if we have  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:25):**  to currently import so much of our fruit and veg but actually we could grow that here,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:30):**  then what is a sort of planning strategy, what is our land use strategy, how do subsidies  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:35):**  work? There needs to be a national plan that coordinates the food that we produce in total  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:41):**  in relation to what people need to eat. Now that's not my area of expertise but I'm pleased  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:45):**  to see at this conference that people are talking about that and indeed the government  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:48):**  is talking about it. I think another ingredient is the right kind of finance. Now that is  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:14:53):**  my area of expertise and for this the RSA Food and Farming Commission has been looking  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:00):**  at whether we need a national agroecology development bank that is there to provide  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:06):**  the right kinds of finance to allow people to change, to transform their farming methods  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:11):**  because existing banks find that a little bit hard to finance. They're very good at  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:16):**  financing what they know and carrying on as usual but carrying on as usual is not an option.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:21):**  So we need the right kind of finance to be able to transform how we farm. The third ingredient  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:26):**  I guess is know-how and of course how to spread that so increasingly I hear people who are  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:33):**  growers, producers, farmers who want to change but don't necessarily know how to set about  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:39):**  it. So I think connecting people and giving them access to know-how is really important.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:45):**  And I think the fourth thing is the involvement of everyone, you know, citizens. I don't like  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:51):**  the word consumer but citizens, we all eat food and that's one of the reasons why I love  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:15:57):**  the growth of cooperative forms of ownership, of community supported agriculture, other  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:03):**  forms of community enterprise because it's a way of the people who are ultimately consuming  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:10):**  the food participate more actively with the people who are producing the food and that's  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:14):**  healthy for all sorts of reasons. So I think after many years in big business and small  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:20):**  business I am a real believer in Schumacher's doctrine that small is beautiful and actually  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:27):**  he didn't say small is beautiful originally, he said that it was important to have the  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:30):**  appropriate scale but the problem is in a world where everybody tends towards things  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:36):**  being big, what we need is a counterweight which is to champion small. Now why is small  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:41):**  business a great thing and why do I think a smaller regional bank is a great thing?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:46):**  Because it's that closeness to your customers and to the place as well, you know, the actual  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:53):**  place where you're operating. Even in a country that is geographically quite small like the  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:16:58):**  UK, there's huge variety in the regions as you go around from, you know, what people  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:04):**  like even as well as the climatic conditions and what grows well and everything. So understanding  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:09):**  local markets, being really closely embedded in communities makes it easier to do better  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:15):**  business and better banking. So that's the regional part, the mutual part sort of goes  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:20):**  alongside it so if your customers are also your owners and they're the ones that control  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:24):**  the business and that the bankers are basically accountable to them, then we believe that  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:29):**  we can restore trust in banking which has really been lost. But I think it's possible  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:34):**  to put back the idea of local managers and decision making that has diversity or inclusivity  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:42):**  at its core and I think that's the other reason why mutuality is a good check on that and  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:48):**  that it enables the business also to operate better because you've got perfect feedback  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:53):**  then between, you know, understanding what your customers need, you're closely connected  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:17:58):**  to them because they are also the guys who run the business effectively, you work for  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:02):**  them. So I always tend to try to look at what is good about a model that I might be rejecting.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:09):**  I guess starting a smaller scale regional mutual bank begs the question, what does that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:15):**  mean that you don't need large corporate banks anymore? And actually I'm not sure that it  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:20):**  does. One thing I think it's important to note is that one of the ways that smaller  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:25):**  scale businesses can be successful is to collaborate with each other in networks because that way  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:31):**  you can achieve some of the benefits of being big, some of the economies of scale as an

**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:40):**  Mutual because the plan is to have a whole network of regional banks across the UK that  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:45):**  work together and so where we can share costs and be more effective working together as  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:49):**  businesses we can do that. So in that way you remove one of the needs, one of the driving  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:54):**  forces towards becoming really big as a corporation. There's a second part to that question though  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:18:59):**  which is about the traditional shareholder owned corporation where the shareholders are  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:04):**  sort of privileged as the preeminent stakeholder and their interests must be served above all  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:11):**  others and their dominance in the economy at the moment is unhealthy and unnecessary.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:18):**  So I would hope for a gradual decline in the amount of our economic activity that's organised  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:23):**  through giant unaccountable shareholder owned corporations and much more of our economic  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:29):**  activity that's organised through democratically controlled smaller scale cooperatives, community  
**[0:19:35-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:35):**  enterprises. Hopefully many of you have listened to Serial,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:43):**  the six part series we released at the end of last year that explores the current food  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:19:47):**  and farming system by uncovering the myths about our bread and stories from the pioneering

**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:01):**  We wanted to share some of the final episode of Serial now to illustrate how everything  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:05):**  Colin and Tony spoke about is embedded in our food systems including in our bread. The  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:11):**  principles of the economy are the principles of industrial bread.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:18):**  I think it's fair to say there's a general feeling that the industrial bread system is  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:23):**  underpinned by a flawed logic, a logic that's damaging to people and planet. As we've heard,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:30):**  it's a logic of alienation. It relies on creating barriers between people in the system and  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:36):**  between people and food. It's a logic of uniformity. It can't cope with diversity, let alone strive  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:43):**  to promote it. It's a logic that implicitly assumes that automation is synonymous with  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:48):**  progress and that bigger necessarily equals better. At every stage from soil to seed to  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:20:56):**  flower to loaf, this logic is undermining the natural systems we depend on, our health,  
**[0:21:02-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:02):**  both physical and mental, the fabric of our communities and the value of people's work.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:10):**  In this series, we've heard about a new grains movement, a movement with a different logic  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:17):**  and a different set of aspirations. It aspires to diversity instead of uniformity, from the  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:23):**  life in the soil to the life in our guts, from the genetics of our seeds to the backgrounds  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:28):**  of the people baking our bread. Resilience as opposed to infinite expansion, collaboration  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:35):**  rather than competition, working on a human scale, not an industrial scale. And at every  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:42):**  stage getting people back into the system, into the mills, onto the farms, into the bakeries  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:49):**  and around the tables, encouraging bakers and farmers and millers and breeders and consumers  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:21:56):**  to talk to each other. This is about creating a more efficient bread system, a system that  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:03):**  generates a lot less waste and takes responsibility for any waste it does create, a system that  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:10):**  operates as more of a closed loop than a linear production line, a system that accounts for  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:15):**  all of its impacts, including everything from people's wages and their job satisfaction  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:20):**  to the carbon footprint of distribution networks to the health of our soils and the health  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:25):**  of our bodies. We are the bread system. Even those of us who interact with it primarily  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:32):**  as consumers, if you eat bread, you're part of it. But the current system tells us otherwise.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:39):**  It encourages us to be passive consumers and it encourages farmers and millers and bakers  
**[0:22:44-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:44):**  to be passive producers. So creating a better system is about moving from passivity to agency.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:52):**  In other words, it's about reclaiming food sovereignty.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:22:56):**  Two of the key characters in the series, baker and regenerative retailer Kimberly Bell and  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:01):**  farmer Fred Price, have both been using their businesses to explore and demonstrate different  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:06):**  ways of building an economy. An economy that's quite the opposite of the neoliberal one.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:12):**  Both are running regenerative businesses that produce food to nourish people. They bring  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:16):**  joy. They promote healthy lifestyles and build communities. We asked them what shifting towards  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:22):**  a regenerative business and regenerative economy means to them.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:27):**  Thinking back to the company that I used to run, which was essentially a shop fitting  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:31):**  firm. We used to work for big retail clients like BP Oil, Starbucks, Hainsbury's. And we  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:39):**  offered a service. It was a very high octane kind of project management service where we  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:43):**  would build these retail units very quickly. The client's attitude towards us is probably  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:50):**  one of the things I think about when asked to define what it was like to run that business.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:23:56):**  The sentiment was very much that it should be our privilege to work for these blue chip  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:01):**  clients. It was very much about being awarded opportunity. We used to use language like  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:07):**  winning work. And really that's just a spin I think for describing a very inequitable  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:15):**  economy where the power was very top down. We had very little self-worth I think as people.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:23):**  Even though we could be proud of the work that we did, we were very good at it. It felt  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:27):**  like the client was our boss, if you like. Even though I was running a small business,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:33):**  I didn't feel like I was working for myself. Generally the work that we were doing, although  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:37):**  it was very creative to build these shops very quickly and lots of problem solving,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:43):**  it was actually, you know, it had no real value. We spent as much time ripping shops  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:47):**  out as we did building them. It was very extractive and wasteful. It never felt like we were achieving  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:53):**  anything for the greater good or really providing anything that was going to benefit society  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:24:58):**  at all in the long term. When I started Small Food six years ago, it was intended to be  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:04):**  an experiment. I'd been working for large food retailers and reading a lot about the  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:09):**  big global food economy, the big industry as it were, and I just felt that everything  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:13):**  about it was wrong intuitively. Perhaps I didn't really understand or wasn't able  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:18):**  to articulate why. So I started Small Food Bakery as an experiment to see whether we  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:24):**  could somehow illustrate very practically what the opposite might be. The sorts of things  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:30):**  that we've explored quite successfully are hierarchies within the team, but also across  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:37):**  wider society. So how can we work equitably with everybody, all the stakeholders required  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:43):**  to deliver food to people, including the customers? And I think one of the things that defines  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:48):**  the way we work now is it's human scale and we deal in relationships. It's person to person.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:25:55):**  So a lot of the way we've designed the business is to make sure that those barriers that are  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:01):**  commonly found in bigger businesses or let's call them the more prevalent business models  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:06):**  of today are removed. So we work from an open kitchen. We don't have sort of shop fitting  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:12):**  counters and glass barriers. We're very open about letting people come in, spending time  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:18):**  talking. Our customer relationships are often two way. They become friends. We barter vegetables.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:24):**  They bring ingredients in. We turn them into something and often send them back. So there's  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:29):**  a lot of reciprocity, I suppose, is an important word. I guess the other thing that's really  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:35):**  worth mentioning is that our business doesn't entirely work on a monetary economy. There's  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:42):**  a lot of other values at play. And I think particularly in light of what's been happening  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:47):**  the last few weeks, which has been a very stressful time with the pandemic, I think  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:51):**  it's really put us to the test. It's put our relationships to the test. And what small  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:26:55):**  food has always been is really about investing in people. And if you took an old traditional  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:01):**  business model, you look at building value on a balance sheet and it's always about fixed  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:05):**  assets and cash in the bank and buildings and equity and those kinds of solid investments.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:12):**  But really for small food, it's about investing in people and it's about building knowledge  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:16):**  and skills and relationships. I feel that that's where we've really been able to be  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:21):**  quite dynamic in the last few weeks and perhaps keep trading at the same level or even slightly  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:27):**  above where we were before, even in the face of some very difficult conditions. It's all  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:33):**  become really important, this issue in the last few weeks with the pandemic, because  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:38):**  the way that we work now really gives us a sense of value as bakers. And it really has  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:43):**  placed us within the community in a way that we understand our role and we don't feel like  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:49):**  commodities that are expendable. We actually feel responsible. And I think that's one of  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:54):**  the most significant changes that a new kind of economics, a smaller scale or human scale  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:27:59):**  economics could bring is a kind of reciprocal sense of both having a sense of value and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:05):**  self worth, which is great for our own sort of morale and mental health, but also feeling  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:11):**  responsible and taking responsibility and seeing how our actions can really directly  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:15):**  influence the outcome of situations like the current pandemic for everyone. It needs to  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:23):**  be acknowledged that we've all grown up and the only kind of economics we've known is  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:28):**  the prevalent one. And that's really informed our sense of values. People judge businesses  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:34):**  success based on how big they can get, how successful they are, how many people you employ,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:40):**  maybe even what car the owner of the business drives. And these ways of measuring success  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:46):**  are totally ingrained in us and in our culture and in our society. And we still get people  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:51):**  ask us questions that kind of pitch us against those yardsticks. And I find them really puzzling.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:28:56):**  The biggest barrier to this kind of economy being adopted is the fact that more people  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:01):**  really need to believe in themselves and they need to get involved. They need to realize  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:06):**  that the food system or changing the food system or changing our economic system is  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:10):**  not something that's going to happen to them. It's only something that's going to happen  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:13):**  if they actually do it. So I think building confidence in individuals and trying to illustrate  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:20):**  that it is within our power to design the system within which we live is probably one  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:26):**  of the most important things to focus on if we want to try to change the prevalent economic  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:32):**  system. What we really need is lots of people working in the way that we are. We can't really  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:37):**  scale up if more of this type of business is adopted by more people, particularly in  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:44):**  the food industry or in the food sector. I just think life will be more delicious. I  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:51):**  think there'll be a lot more joy and a lot more pleasure. And I think alongside that  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:29:56):**  and more importantly, potentially, is that we will see better and more equitable society  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:05):**  where more people have access to good food and there isn't such a divide between what  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:10):**  certain types of people eat. I think that just will be a great leveler and probably  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:15):**  ripple out and influence all sorts of other aspects of life.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:20):**  Well I suppose when I took on the farm a decade or so ago, we were just a small arable farm  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:25):**  trying to keep up producing commodities, wheat, barley or seed rape. We had no control over  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:31):**  the price and so my entire focus was on yield. And what came with that is a focus on a whole  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:39):**  host of synthetic inputs to achieve it. I guess the problem was on farm we were experiencing  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:46):**  a kind of yield plateau. Year on year we're pushing crops harder just to stand still.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:51):**  And so I guess the beginning of my journey started here, a kind of interrogation of that  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:30:58):**  yield plateau. And the answer lay in the fact that the soil health was way more complex  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:05):**  than my agronomist or seed company would have me believe. The inputs we were hooked on,  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:10):**  nitrogen insecticides, fungicides, they all have negative impacts on the kind of natural  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:15):**  cycles and dynamics that really underpin soil health. Since then, I guess seven or eight  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:22):**  years, I've just been exploring how far the farm can acknowledge and really enhance those  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:28):**  natural cycles. It's been really eye opening and frankly pretty addictive. The thing is  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:35):**  this is only half the story and it's the old commodity model that we were selling into,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:40):**  with no way of rewarding or attaching value to these kind of new agroecological principles  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:45):**  that was the real problem. So the new model is really based around relationships, I guess  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:51):**  authenticity and a huge amount of openness and collaboration. By engaging with bakers,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:31:58):**  millers, chefs, consumers directly, we've earned the right to start from the perspective,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:03):**  how do I want to farm and work backwards, which before we were starting from a commodity  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:08):**  framework and working forwards, i.e. ending up with a grow more strategy with all those  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:12):**  negative inputs. I guess you'd describe it as a small food economy. It seems to encapsulate  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:19):**  the idea that it's human scale and about food, not commodities. The general interest in and  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:26):**  around the farm from customers and our little community on social media is really heartening.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:31):**  The thought that bakers can stand in a field of emmer or wheat or chefs amongst a load  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:37):**  of pigs that they're going to be handling at some point in the future and decide that  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:42):**  they have an appetite for what we're growing is actually a really special feeling. Just  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:47):**  at the moment, restaurants being shut has been a real shock to the system. I guess the  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:52):**  challenge going forward is to adjust how we work to reach people more directly. But in  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:32:57):**  a way that's got to be sustainable long term, we don't want just a knee jerk reaction that  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:02):**  wears me out doing deliveries and packing. I mean, I'm just a farmer. The other side  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:07):**  of this coin, though, I guess, is right now in this crisis, it's really reinforced to  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:12):**  me that people still do have a capacity to value food in ways that's not just price and  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:19):**  quantity. I guess at the moment, it feels a kind of negative feeling, but it does demonstrate  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:24):**  that that kind of close connection to food is possible and that actually huge fundamental  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:30):**  shifts in our food system can happen and can happen quite quickly. I guess the whole principle  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:36):**  of what we're doing is not to create a product or protect a kind of niche product, somehow  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:41):**  corner the market in heritage grains or pastured pork. Far from it. First of all, our farm  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:46):**  has a certain carrying capacity for stock, and the nature of our rotation means we're  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:50):**  only growing cereals two years and five. The work we're doing exploring diversity in cereal  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:33:55):**  production, specifically for low input agricultural systems, actually has to be shared. That means  
**[0:34:00-0:34:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:00):**  seed, ideas, and support. Me having seed in the ground and establishing a network of bakers  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:08):**  and millers here in the Southwest is just the first step. There are big logistical and  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:13):**  legal barriers to enable the kind of work we're doing here to reach more people. The  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:18):**  whole point is to be as collaborative and open source as possible. When those buying  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:23):**  your produce are your friends and the relationships that underpin the supply chain are all about  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:29):**  shared values, it really enables you to be released from that kind of idea of competition  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:35):**  and that kind of individualism and protectionism that is associated with the old model. And  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:42):**  it's really liberating. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clearer than ever just how vulnerable  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:50):**  industrial food systems are. Actually, there's a very different type of efficiency and resilience  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:34:57):**  in smaller food networks. They're much more nimble and able to adapt to the ever evolving  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:02):**  situation to ensure that their local communities are fed. These more direct human scale networks  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:09):**  are what Colin, Tony, Kim, and Fred were all talking about. I have no background in economics  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:16):**  and really my heart is in the soil. But as we have been bringing you the voices behind  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:21):**  regenerative farming over the last five years, it's become clear that in order to build  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:27):**  ecological farming futures and to rejuvenate respect for farmers and rural communities,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:34):**  we need to look beyond the farming system itself. If we look at why most farmers are  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:39):**  still doing chemical or conventional farming, it's in part due to debt traps and the need  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:45):**  to meet the demands of the commodity market. It's all connected. Sometimes I find that  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:50):**  thought overwhelming, but then I hear the stories of people already living a new reality,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:35:56):**  experimenting with different forms of business that better serve regenerative farming and  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:36:01):**  humanity as a whole. And I'm filled with hope. Let's work together to build a new normal  
**[0:36:07-0:36:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/55-enlightened-agriculture-sustainable-economies-and-regenerative-businesses#t=0:36:07):**  based on diversity, food sovereignty, care, collaboration, and of course, healthy soils.

## Field Report: Urban Food Fortnight  
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to a special field report from Farmerama. From the 9th to the 25th of  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:06):**  September, Urban Food Fortnight Fund descends on London. Here's Clara Gilbert from London  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:11):**  Food Link to tell us what this special edition is all about.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:15):**  So Urban Food Fortnight is our celebration of all the food that's being grown, made,  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:20):**  cooked and saved in London. There's loads going on behind closed doors, from community  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:25):**  gardens to surplus food being saved from markets and shops. There's so much going on and here  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:31):**  at London Food Link we like to think we're the voice for good food in London. So this  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:35):**  is really our chance to shout about it and let people know what's happening. Big thanks  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:38):**  to Jasmine who went and got loads of stories for us for this edition.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:44):**  So in this episode we're going to concentrate on the four themes of Urban Food Fortnight.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:48):**  Grow, Make, Cook, Save. Let the journey begin.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:00:58):**  Firstly we head to Grow Up Farms. This farm is based in a very urban industrial estate  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:04):**  in East London. But inside the building is piled high with rows of leafy greens. Grow  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:10):**  Up Farms is London's first commercial aquaponics farm. Jasmine met with CEO Kate Hoffman to  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:16):**  give us a bit of an intro to how this works and why she thinks it's an important technology  
**[0:01:21-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:21):**  for growing in cities.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:23):**  We are sat at Unit 84 which is the UK's first commercial aquaponics urban farm and it's  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:32):**  the first commercial farm that Grow Up Urban Farms has built. We've been running now for,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:39):**  we've been in production for about six months. We moved into this farm about 14 months ago  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:46):**  and just then it was an empty warehouse and we fitted it out with our indoor vertical  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:01:53):**  aquaponics system and now we are selling salads and herbs and microgreens and soon we'll be  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:00):**  selling the fish too to customers across London.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:04):**  Aquaponics is a combination of two well established farming practices. Aquaculture, farming fish  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:10):**  and hydroponics, growing plants in a nutrient solution without any soil. We take the waste  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:15):**  water from the fish farm, use that as the nutrient source for the plants. The plants  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:21):**  absorb those waste nutrients in the water, actually clean the water for the fish and  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:26):**  the whole system recirculates. So it's a very water efficient way of farming. We have a  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:32):**  natural fertiliser base from the fish waste and we don't use any pesticides or insecticides  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:39):**  in our growing room.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:41):**  Some parts of that technology have been around for a really long time. So hundreds of years  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:45):**  ago in China farmers would flood their rice paddy fields and put fish into them and the  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:50):**  fish would eat any bugs that were around and they would fertilise the plants and then when  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:02:55):**  you drained the fields you'd have your rice and your fish to eat. So that symbiosis between  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:01):**  the two systems or the two types of growing, that's been around for a long time. What's  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:07):**  more innovative and new, what we're doing is bringing that together in an urban environment  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:13):**  and controlling that whole system indoors. In a way what we're doing here is very different  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:19):**  and feels very different from a traditional arable or an arable farm or a horticulture  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:25):**  business. But actually it's still, as a business it operates in a very similar way. You know,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:32):**  you're focused on your yield and that's where you make your revenue from and that's what  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:36):**  covers your costs as a business. And although it might seem different and it might not be  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:44):**  how you would expect food to be grown, actually I think the reality is most people have no  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:48):**  idea how their food is grown, especially if you live in a city and you don't really have  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:52):**  much contact with agriculture. People have no idea, you know, our food system, especially  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:03:59):**  for this country, it's already heavily industrialised. We import a lot of our food, especially fresh  
**[0:04:06-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:06):**  produce and the majority of that is not grown by Fung and Bob in a field, you know, with  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:16):**  his tractor. We're already using a lot of technology and innovation in the way that  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:21):**  we produce food because we have to in order to be able to produce it in the quantity that  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:25):**  people will need it. Yeah, as I said, it's about finding a combination of things to use.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:29):**  So I guess there are certain places in the world where it makes sense to do certain types  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:33):**  of farming depending on what the land is and what the resources are available. But there  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:37):**  are also certain places, namely cities, where you have a big concentration of people and  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:44):**  you need to be able to make the best use of the space that you've got in order to feed  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:50):**  them. And the reality is that that volume of food, you know, and the consistency throughout  
**[0:04:56-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:04:56):**  the year that people require cannot just come from very traditional farming methods. People  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:04):**  are very receptive and I think in London especially, increasingly what we see is that people are  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:10):**  really interested in where their food has come from and people are starting to understand  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:16):**  that actually the food you choose to buy and eat has a difference in terms of environmental  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:21):**  impact. They might also care about the health implications for themselves. They also might  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:27):**  just be, you know, cost conscious. Our main social purpose is not about education or outreach.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:35):**  Our social impact is around our job creation and skills and development programme for our  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:39):**  staff actually. But on the other hand, to be on top of that, to be able to have that  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:44):**  interaction with people can be a very positive thing to help them understand a bit more about  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:50):**  what it takes to produce the food they eat. Grow up, beholding to you meet the producer  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:54):**  events during the fortnight. Head to the Albion in Clarkingwell on the 13th of September or  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:05:59):**  Eat17 on the 21st and they'll tell you a bit more about their project and you'll get to  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:03):**  sample their microgreens. They're also on the producers list so make sure you keep an  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:07):**  eye out for them in restaurants and shops across the capital. At Farmerama we're always  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:13):**  probing positive farming futures and we're interested to see how aquaponics fits with  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:18):**  this. At the moment there's so many different perspectives it's hard to know. From regenerative  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:26):**  growing to regenerative making, we ventured to a wonderful courtyard haven in Dalston  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:32):**  where we chatted to Max Tobias of the Dusty Knuckle Bakery, surrounded by bee gardens  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:36):**  and plentiful plants, to hear about the process of making and baking in the city. Dusty Knuckles  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:43):**  is all about making beautiful bread and delicious things with great care and obsessive energy.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:48):**  They're also a social enterprise, crafting their bread with youth offenders and early  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:53):**  school leavers. The bakery are implementing their youth engagement programme slowly but  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:06:58):**  surely and Max has a few ideas of how to get started with a social enterprise. I'm Max  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:05):**  Tobias, I'm one of the co-founders of the Dusty Knuckle Bakery here and I've been obsessed  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:13):**  with making bread since I was quite young. I made my first loaf of bread when I was about  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:18):**  12. It just triggered a bit of an obsession really. About four or five years ago I started  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:25):**  to think seriously about trying to open a bakery. I was working with young people in  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:31):**  a number of different roles for mainly charities and that work was really with young people  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:38):**  who were in a lot of trouble and involved with criminality and violence and so on. My  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:44):**  dream was to start a bakery that could engage young people in the workplace really and teach  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:51):**  them about what it is to earn their keep and enter the world of legitimate work and hopefully  
**[0:07:59-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:07:59):**  see more of a future for themselves, a financially independent future. So yeah, this bakery kind  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:08):**  of combines my two passions which was bread as a kind of hobby up to that point and youth  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:15):**  engagement as a profession. We started to apply for some kind of start-up funding and  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:21):**  thankfully were successful with one or two of those bids and then entered into a partnership  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:26):**  with Bootstrap, the charity here who are our landlords and who lease us this space. They  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:30):**  had this shipping container sitting here doing nothing and before we knew it we kind of had  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:38):**  a small amount of money to buy an oven and we had somewhere to put it. So in the future  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:43):**  what we would like is to work with young people who haven't worked before and we see that  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:50):**  happening in a kind of phased program if you like. So it would begin with quite kind of  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:08:57):**  light touch trying to really just provide a kind of hook to get the feet through the  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:03):**  door as it were and to generate an interest and then moving forward into more kind of  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:09):**  structured work experience programs and for those with whom the fit is right moving forward  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:13):**  again into kind of part-time and then full-time employment. In the future I would like to  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:17):**  partner with third sector organizations like Hackney Quest, Spark to Life, those trying  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:24):**  to engage young people perhaps with some additional needs. Hopefully going forward in the longer  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:31):**  term future we can engage statutory organizations as well like the youth offending services,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:36):**  the care system but at the same time I'm trying to be kind of pragmatic with what we can and  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:41):**  can't do whilst we're still quite a fledgling business ultimately. So it's kind of always  
**[0:09:47-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:47):**  trying to be strategic with our resources so that we kind of tick long term aims as  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:09:56):**  well as short term aims. A piece of advice that I got very very early on which has really  
**[0:10:01-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:01):**  stayed with me is that the number one single most important trait of any social entrepreneur  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:11):**  is endurance. If you really want to make it happen you've got to really strap up your  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:17):**  boots and prepare yourself for a kind of long term slog. Darcy and Ackler are on the Urban  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:23):**  Food Fortnite producers list so make sure you keep an eye out for them and they've also  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:27):**  kindly donated a prize for our raffle at the 5x15 Future of Urban Food event taking place  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:33):**  at Farmopolis on the 22nd September. Make sure you head to that to be on the chance  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:37):**  to win. Once the bread has been baked and the greens grown of course the chefs of the  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:44):**  city can't wait to get their hands on this local and seasonal produce. Oliver Rowe is  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:48):**  a London based chef and he has a few tips on what it takes to serve seasonal and local  
**[0:10:53-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:10:53):**  produce in the city. I became a chef about 20 years ago because maybe 19 years ago because  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:02):**  I went initially on a working holiday to Tuscany. It's one of the reasons why I have a passion  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:09):**  for local and seasonal food because all the produce that we were using there was amazing  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:14):**  and it came, was mostly grown locally so that was for me, that sort of set the tone for  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:20):**  what food should be about for me. That's how I became a chef and then I came back to London  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:24):**  and I got a job at Morro which is a Spanish and North African restaurant in Clarkinwell.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:30):**  After Morro I sort of came to a bit of a, I wasn't quite sure, a bit of a crossroads,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:36):**  I wasn't quite sure what to do so I opened a café which was all about kind of provincial  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:42):**  European, not kind of high cuisine but still with lots of European influences and then  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:50):**  I opened a restaurant nearby called, the café was called Constam and the restaurant was  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:11:56):**  called Constam at the Prince Albert and that was a really interesting restaurant for the  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:02):**  reason that we sourced about 80% of the ingredients that we used were from in and around London  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:10):**  or in and around Greater London. Not only did it make me connect with various urban  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:17):**  farming projects, various growing projects but I also connected to, reached out to the  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:22):**  farms in and around London so you can't really run a restaurant based on everything just  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:29):**  being grown inside the London city limits, it's not really feasible but nonetheless  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:33):**  quite a large amount was from really, really very, very close and the idea was to be seasonal  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:40):**  really that was the thing. It followed on from the rationale of the more local you are  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:46):**  the more seasonal you are. Environmental concerns were very important, a few people, yeah it  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:51):**  was something that was becoming important but also I looked into the health benefits  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:12:56):**  and the taste benefits and I think also in terms of running a restaurant one of the most  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:01):**  important elements is that if you eat things seasonally, which when you eat things locally  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:06):**  you do, then you are eating things when they're in a glut and when things are in a glut they're  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:13):**  cheaper. So it works on four levels, so seasonal eating uses less energy because you're harnessing  
**[0:13:20-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:20):**  as many of the basic natural resources you have at your disposal. There are slightly  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:29):**  more nutrients in food that is grown seasonally but it tastes better as well so seasonal food  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:36):**  tastes better. I mean we just all know that the tomatoes and strawberries in the summer  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:41):**  taste a million times better. Environment, health, taste and money, so there's four reasons  
**[0:13:47-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:47):**  why I think eating things seasonally is important and beneficial. People expect a lot from restaurants  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:55):**  now but I think that people are much more familiar with the idea of food being local,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:13:59):**  food being seasonal, so that's something I think it took a while to negotiate and I think  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:04):**  people are very savvy now so people go into a restaurant and they expect it a lot of the  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:08):**  time. If you're not a chain, chains are very different as well and they're very hard to,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:12):**  that's one of the big nuts that we still have to grab, but if you're not a chain, if you're  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:15):**  an independent restaurant, people expect a changing menu, they expect you to be featuring  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:20):**  local seasonal produce, they expect a range of vegetarian food and so on, so people are  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:25):**  very, quite demanding. Whilst I loved working with urban farming projects and it was great  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:30):**  and some of the produce was amazing, it's really going to provide you with enough produce  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:37):**  to actually run a restaurant or a cafe but you do need to work with lots of different  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:43):**  individuals, it takes a bit of time, there's no one person you can go to and say, supply  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:49):**  me with UK produce because everyone's trying to, everyone's having to make compromises  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:54):**  here and there. You have to work with your suppliers and ask them what's locally sourced,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:14:59):**  what's locally reared and focus on that and be prepared to limit your menu. Your menu  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:08):**  has to reflect the availability of the produce that you are selling, that you can buy and  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:14):**  that forces you to be creative, that's the great thing is I think seasonal and local  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:19):**  produce, because it's an intermittent supply, as a chef that's great, it forces you to be  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:26):**  creative to think about what you've got, it gives you like a palette and it gives you  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:29):**  like a larder which you have to select from and make dishes out of and that changes as  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:35):**  the year goes by and so you have to come up with new things, new flavours, new combinations  
**[0:15:40-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:40):**  or research interesting recipes or think and create basically.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:49):**  Listening to Oliver brought up a funny question, is food grown by aquaponics seasonal? And  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:15:56):**  what will seasonal mean as climates evolve and drought descends in previously lush landscapes?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:02):**  These are the kinds of questions the cooking sections team are asking through their Climavore  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:06):**  dinners at the Empire Remains shop in Baker Street. Check them out.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:12):**  Oliver's collaborating this year with the London Cooking Project. They're a really great  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:16):**  social enterprise in Battersea and they work to provide opportunities for young people  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:21):**  in the area. He holds seasonal supper clubs throughout the year and this month he's holding  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:26):**  a special local to London urban food fortnight feast. Join them on the 15th of September  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:30):**  for a four course meal which features producers including Cobble Lane Cured and locally grown  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:35):**  veg.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:37):**  As Oliver mentioned with seasons there's often a glut of produce. All tomatoes are ripe at  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:42):**  the same time and sometimes we can't eat them all so it's important to have effective ways  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:47):**  of dealing with leftovers or extra food. Luckily there are a few people helping us work on  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:54):**  this. Laura Hammond from Plan Zeroes tells us how both individuals and businesses can  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:16:59):**  start saving surplus food from being piled on the rubbish heap.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:04):**  Plan Zeroes is a registered charity and we facilitate donations of surplus food from  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:08):**  businesses to charities that are working with people in need. So we get surplus food to  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:13):**  charities such as homelessness charities, charities that are supporting the elderly,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:18):**  people with mental health issues, substance misuse issues, low income families, things  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:23):**  like that. The way we do this is through two projects. One is a project at Borough Market  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:28):**  and that's been running for two years now. It's a very successful project. It was part  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:31):**  of the food save program of the GLA. The other project is an online platform for surplus  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:39):**  food donations and that we launched last year. It's a free platform and it's a social network  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:45):**  where businesses can create profiles with the types of food they have to donate when  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:50):**  they might be donating it. There's over 180 volunteers registered on the platform. Not  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:17:56):**  all of them are active but they are registered and charities can contact them to ask if they  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:02):**  could help collect and deliver the food if the charities can't do it themselves. We get  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:07):**  inquiries from all over the UK, all over the world in fact, so we definitely see our  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:14):**  platform growing in other areas of the UK. It started in London because the co-founders  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:20):**  were based here and Plan Zero basically started out of a movement at Citizens UK. So it was  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:28):**  a bunch of people that were really concerned about the amounts of food they saw going to  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:33):**  waste in London and the people around them who needed it. Definitely we've seen an increase  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:39):**  in awareness in general around the issue of food waste and its impact on the environment.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:46):**  I think that's evident by recent programs on TV such as Hughes War on Waste. Several  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:53):**  years ago the supermarkets weren't doing anything in terms of redistributing their surplus food  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:18:59):**  and now several of them have major programs to do that and it's part of their sustainability  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:05):**  program in general. So I think there's definitely growing awareness and I think consumers are  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:11):**  also putting pressure on the supermarkets. There have been some online campaigns trying  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:16):**  to get the supermarkets to do more about their food waste and there's a lot more solutions  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:21):**  out there for food businesses to redistribute their surplus food or for food waste to dispose  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:29):**  of it in a more sustainable way through anaerobic digestion, converting it to energy and things  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:34):**  like that. There's lots more apps out there right now as well for people to use everything  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:42):**  from businesses to consumers. So I think generally it's a good time and everything's moving in  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:48):**  the right direction but there's more we can do in terms of encouraging businesses, not  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:19:53):**  forcing them but encouraging them to redistribute their surplus through tax incentives, just  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:00):**  making the food safety issues a little bit more clear and the FSA is working on that  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:06):**  at the moment. But I think tax incentives would be a huge, they do that in the US, there's  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:13):**  tax breaks for businesses that donate food. So anything we can do to encourage the businesses  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:20):**  to redistribute more would be great. I think right now for individuals there's an app called  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:26):**  Olio which is quite a nice solution. So if you have that celery at home and you know  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:32):**  you're not going to use it you can upload it on their app and your neighbour can come  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:36):**  around and collect it. So there are different solutions out there for individual consumers.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:43):**  That's not something that we're considering at the moment just because I said we're working  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:46):**  directly with charities and we want to ensure that that food is safe for them. Consumer  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:52):**  food waste is about 70% of the total food waste in the UK. It's huge and there's been,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:20:58):**  I mean I think there's been a lot of progress through the Love Food Hate Waste campaign  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:04):**  of WRAP but there's still definitely more to be done and you know even I'm guilty of  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:09):**  it sometimes. You know I'm just not careful about watching what's in my fridge and it's  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:13):**  gone past the use by date and it feels awful and everything. So there's definitely more  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:20):**  things like which can help you in terms of thinking of recipes or the ways that you can  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:25):**  use that surplus that you have at home. That's such a great example of how technology can  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:30):**  really help bring the right people together and allow connections of want and waste. So  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:35):**  Plan Zero has teamed up with Global Generations Skip Garden to hold a disco soup on the 18th  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:40):**  of September where you can chop to the beat and save waste food. There'll be DJs, workshops  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:47):**  and even a cook-off so it looks like it's going to be an ace event. So there are over  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:53):**  70 events taking place during the fortnight so make sure you check out the map online  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:21:58):**  and get down to one of the events between the 9th and the 25th. From open gardens to  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:22:02):**  pop-up dinners and cocktail evenings there seems to be something for everyone so get  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-field-report-urban-food-fortnight#t=0:22:06):**  involved. Even if you're not London based be sure and check it out because I found there

## 09: SoilCity in Glasgow, Farmhack, urban farm updates, glasshouses, plus rural entrepreneurs  
**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  I hope you're listening. Anybody who's not waxing, clean it out now, because I don't  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:14):**  want you to say you didn't hear.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  Hello again and welcome to Farmeroma. This month we're knee-deep in lambs, or well, Nigel  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:25):**  is, as you can hear in the background. So we'll be catching up with him later in the  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:28):**  show in his report from the Farmers for Action march in London.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  This week we have some reports from the Soil City event in Glasgow. We pay a visit to the  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:38):**  greenhouses at Hankum Organics and we check in with Hannah who brushes the soil from her  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:43):**  hands just long enough to have a chat with Sheila Martin in Dagenham.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:47):**  Last month we heard for the first time from Keisha Crawford-Davis and we're delighted  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:51):**  to welcome her back this week for a second report. This time she tells us about a Scottish  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:00:56):**  programme for shepherding the next generation of rural leaders.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:00):**  My name's Rob Doy. I'm a potato farmer essentially, although I work for a company that does potato  
**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:05):**  breeding and innovation. It's been a really valuable tool for making you re-examine your  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:14):**  attitude to yourself, your staff, your customers, your business as a whole, where you sit in  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:20):**  the network of everything. And so it's very challenging. It's been challenging. I think  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:26):**  if there's been a surprise at all it's been how intense it's been. They don't waste a  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:29):**  single minute of your time. But it's been immensely rewarding.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:33):**  And this is something rural areas need?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:37):**  I think it's bringing the sort of leadership and business management issues that maybe  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:42):**  other industries, especially big corporations, maybe do a bit more habitually, but you don't  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:46):**  get access to when you're quite often one man businesses, two man businesses, small,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  really small. I mean, they talk about small and medium enterprises, but most farms are  
**[0:01:54-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:01:54):**  three, four, five, six staff. And it gives you access to a forum to build your skills  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  at managing those teams that you wouldn't get access to. Certainly I don't think there's  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:06):**  ever been access to that kind of thing in a rural context before.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:11):**  My name's Jane Craigie and I was on the Scottish Enterprise Rural Leadership Program in 2011-12.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:18):**  There's so much that I think is wonderful about what it achieves, but I think probably  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  the most important thing is that the people who have been on the Rural Leadership Program  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  think differently about how they can build their businesses, how they can engage with  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  their communities and how they can deliver more.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:36):**  If you listen to a lot of farmers, and particularly now when prices are very, very depressed,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:44):**  it's very natural to hunker down, to think about how you're going to pay your feed bill,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:52):**  how you're going to get your milk price up. It's really, really easy to do that. But if  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  you look at, certainly through my travels and through the Rural Leadership Program,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:02):**  you see people that think, okay, I've got to do something different. Out of adversity,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:06):**  hope springs and opportunity develops. And so often we see that, and I've seen it more  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:12):**  amongst rural leaders than any other sector in agriculture and the rural community.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:17):**  For me, I think probably first and foremost because contacts, my network is so important,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:22):**  it's really helped me improve my network. It's improved my profile, but it's also improved  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:29):**  my knowledge of how the rural community really works. And in Scotland, that's not just about  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:35):**  farming, which is the area I'm involved in. It's about tourism. It's about food and drink.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:39):**  It's about energy. It's about managing and embracing what our landscape has to offer.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  There's so many facets that are wonderful about our rural economy. And I think the Rural  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:49):**  Leadership Program allows all of those people and businesses that are involved in the rural  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:03:56):**  economy to really work together and make their communities and Scottish economy blossom.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:03):**  Thank you, Keisha. If you want to find out more, we'll make sure we have all the details  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:07):**  shared on the Facebook page. At the end of this, Keisha let us know that the most important  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:13):**  thing she got out of this was the realization that no matter how successful someone may  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:17):**  look, whatever that means, it's rarely a reflection on how that person feels in themselves.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:24):**  We all need to constantly learn about ourselves and the world around us in order to move forward.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  And that's what we're all about at Farmerama.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:32):**  Niaowil Buiya, St John's Wort Hill. Fueven Diatach, the Snackeral Spring.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:04:56):**  These names take root wherever we dwell, as ken marks revealing the knowing eye of the  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:02):**  crofter, stalker or forager who categorized hills and woods and mapped transhumance the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:11):**  summer walking.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:13):**  Esan Rui An Arry, the Linn touching the grazing. Names stay still, the horizon recedes.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:29):**  Knochtay, the wildfire now, the tang of smoke driven away long ago but the fire keeps on  
**[0:05:39-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:39):**  burning in the name.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:51):**  For growers, it's all hands on deck as it starts to get lighter and warmer day by day.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:05:57):**  Hannah headed back to Growing Communities Farm in East London to catch up with head  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:01):**  grower Sheila Martin to get her tips for the season ahead.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:05):**  Mmmmmm, restart manure and all.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:10):**  In here we've got all our seedlings and we've been planting out quite a lot already. So  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:16):**  we've got tomatoes in the ground. We've got a lot of salad because we grow a lot of salad  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:21):**  which goes to restaurants and into our organic box scheme. What else have we got? We're planting  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:28):**  out beans and we've got thousands of tomato plants because we over planted them.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  And have you made any decisions with varieties this year that are different to before?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah, well we've gone for the ones which are going to be the most prolific and also with  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:44):**  the most best flavour because we have used a lot from our safe seed with a lot of interesting  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:50):**  varieties but some of them don't produce very much and because we've got a production kitchen  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:06:56):**  here this year we're going to be processing a lot of them so it doesn't really matter  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:01):**  so much what they look like, it's what they taste like and how many we have of them. So  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:06):**  that's the focus this year.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:08):**  That's interesting. So is quantity and flavour over fancy looking?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:13):**  Yeah, we'll have a few of those but they, you know, it sounds like we're trying to do  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:18):**  mass production but it's really just about making the most efficient use of our time  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  and what we have available.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:24):**  And have you done anything with the beds there? Added any additional things for the tomatoes?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:29):**  Yes we have, we got a great big load of shit arrived from one of our, it's an organic dairy  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:40):**  farm in East Sussex which had a film made about it that went to the Sundance Film Festival  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:46):**  called The Moo Man and so we've got a great big pile of Moo Man poo at the top.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:51):**  So we've got movie star poo?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah we have indeed, yeah, 22 tonnes of it and it's all being put into the, in with our  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:07:59):**  tomatoes so that'll increase their nutrient and nitrogen content. So yeah we've got superstar  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:06):**  poo in our...  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:07):**  Fingers crossed for superstar tomato.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  Yeah absolutely, yeah.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:13):**  Now Ben recently stopped off at Hankum Organics, one of only a handful of organic glasshouse  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  growers in the UK. The team there grow a variety of veg, particularly leaves, and distribute  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:24):**  them in a box scheme, but it's been a real labour of love and gruelling hard work to  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:29):**  rebuild the site from the dilapidated state that it was in four years ago.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:33):**  It's been a glasshouse and horticulture site for probably about a hundred years we reckon.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:43):**  And that was a glasshouse that's now a cloud full of sports cars, that's our landlord's  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:47):**  not mine.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:48):**  Is that still the same structure?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:49):**  Same structure yeah, he clad it and concrete around the edges. The planning people first  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:08:57):**  said that was alright and then they came and looked and went, these are a bit thin, you'd  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:01):**  have to put concrete around every single one of them. And so by the time we finished it  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:04):**  all he decided it would have been cheap to just flatten it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:08):**  There used to be a concrete glasshouse, literally made out of concrete, reinforced concrete  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:14):**  in the patch just between us and the neighbours. The area, the green area in front with the  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  broad beans was nearly all cloches, like glass cloches, traditional old glass cloches. Where  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:26):**  that canteen is is the old boiler house, there was a big chimney in the middle of the site,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:31):**  obviously all got too expensive and everyone went out of business. There was a massive,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:35):**  well actually it was only a half acre plot, but it was a single span glasshouse, I don't  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:40):**  know if anybody knows the business, Architectural Plants, they've got the same one. It was  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  designed by a NASA guy who built aircraft hangers designed to have no internal supports,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  all the weight was on the outside and it was tied in by a sort of central beam. And that  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  was really impressive and we really wanted to use that but it was just ridiculous the  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  maintenance costs of that and the health and safety considerations of getting up and replacing  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  glass in the 1990s and teenies were a lot more than they would have been when they built  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  it and I think there's miles of seen pictures of people in flares in their 70s up there  
**[0:10:23-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  just on ladders, it's literally, I think the highest point was 65 foot. But to cut a long  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:33):**  story short there's just constant flux of buildings coming down and stuff and that concrete  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:36):**  is a reminder that a lot of stuff has come down and just had nowhere to go and the expense  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:42):**  of trying to get rid of stuff. As the costs of maintaining it are becoming prohibitive  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:47):**  to us in terms of what we're getting out of it. At some point between now and ten years  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:53):**  we're probably going to have to think very carefully about whether we put it down and  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:10:57):**  put up another one or get the landlord to put it down and put up another one and then  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:00):**  pay an extortionate rent. So there's a lot of kind of head scratching to do but we're  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:05):**  pretty committed to the site and what we're doing so we're hoping we can find some way  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:09):**  of moving on through it.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:16):**  In some ways the Hankum site is not so unusual, particularly for an English farm, but I just  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:21):**  thought these descriptions were powerful and it's really got us thinking about all the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:25):**  different parts of the world where people are trying to make a living from the land  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:28):**  in one way or another. If you know of any farms in interesting or surprising places  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  then please do let us know. We're always really interested to hear where you're listening  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:38):**  to us anyway.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:39):**  Ben was actually on site for the Organic Growers Alliance AGM and he caught up with Kate Collins  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:44):**  to hear more about the ins and outs of why she's a member.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:47):**  Okay, so I'm a member of the AGA because when I started out I knew a little bit but not  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:54):**  very much so I thought the best way of learning some more would be to meet other growers and  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:11:58):**  steal all their knowledge basically and I can do that through meeting them at events,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:12:05):**  the forums, getting lots of information by asking direct questions and having lots of  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:12:10):**  different growers give me their different opinions on how to do something and then there's  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:12:14):**  the amazing Organic Grow magazine as well with lots of technical articles showing you  
**[0:12:18-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:12:18):**  how to do things, different opinions, so yeah it's just huge amounts of information basically.  
**[0:12:32-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:12:32):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  A culture that is considering the reintroduction of the wolf, the lynx, the wild boar may also  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:13):**  wish to consider reintroducing their place names.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:19):**  Kivvad, the root bog of the wolf.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:35):**  Open Jar Collective is a co-op made up of artists and designers who strive to empower  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  people to debate the future of our food systems.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:42):**  They launched Soil City at Glasgow International Festival.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:49):**  Open Jar Collective is a group of artists who use food as a lens to view the world.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  We're based in Glasgow and there's a really flourishing community growing movement in  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:13:58):**  Glasgow but there's also a lot of derelict and vacant land and we're quite interested  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  in how that land has often been written off as valueless because it may be contaminated  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:10):**  from former industrial use and if any growing happens on that land it's normally in raised  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:16):**  beds and imported soil and we started to really think what would this city look like if soil  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:22):**  was valued as a collective resource rather than land only being valued in terms of its  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  development potential for building on and so we really wanted to start looking at people's  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:34):**  relationship to the land in the city and not only think of these sites as wastelands but  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:42):**  as a whole range of having a whole range of uses.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:47):**  Through Soil City we're trying to engage with communities all over the city and really reconnect  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:53):**  with land and with nature and with the soil itself, exploring the soil and looking at  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  how soil provides nourishment not only through food growing but also just through connection  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:05):**  to nature and wildlife and biodiversity.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:08):**  So we're doing a whole range of different activities from earthworm surveys to identifying  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:14):**  plants and animals and invertebrates and also talking to people, creating a space for conversation  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:20):**  about the future use of land which may lead towards food production, it may lead to phytoremediation  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  projects where we try and remove contaminants from the soil and we're seeing this as a long  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:32):**  term project where we can really think about land use in the city.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:37):**  We're just trying to explore that tension really I guess between the idea that urban  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:41):**  populations need to be fed by land outside of the city and where there are models where  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:46):**  we can look at really upscaling our urban food production.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:52):**  Farm Hack is a community for those who embrace the long standing farm traditions of tinkering,  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:15:58):**  inventing, fabricating, tweaking and improving things that break.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:02):**  The seed of Farmerama was actually born at the first ever Farm Hack in the UK last April.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:08):**  As part of Soil City, the wonderful Severine introduced Farm Hack and what it takes to  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:13):**  organise an event.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:14):**  Rebecca Chan was there for Farmerama.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:18):**  The farming life can be tough, especially if you're a young farmer just getting started.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:23):**  Farm Hack is a worldwide community of farmers working to make this process a little easier  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:28):**  and less isolating.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:29):**  The community gathers around building and modifying tools, people share their hacks  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  on the website and in person with hundreds of people attending their meet ups in the  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  states.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:39):**  Severine von Chana-Fleming is one of the founders of the project and with the movement now picking  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:43):**  up speed in the UK, she came to Soil City in Glasgow to share her experiences and to  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  talk all things tools.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:51):**  So they're basically these clusters of technology solutions and tool ideas that have to do with  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:16:58):**  the common problems of small farms.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:01):**  So there's different camps of tools, there's a lot of tools around Arduinos which is like  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:06):**  an open sourced little mini robot that can be programmed to do actions like send you  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:11):**  a text message when your greenhouse is too hot or send you a message if your fence, your  
**[0:17:16-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:16):**  cattle fence is down and there's kits to convert tractors to electric and so that's  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  really nice and you can have a solar powered tractor.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:27):**  Then there's a bunch of equipment that's around milling and grain processing because  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  grain processing is another area where it's gone gigantic and grain processing has become  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:40):**  one of the major points of corporate control in our food system.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:44):**  Food sovereignty is a huge part of what Farmhack is about, putting the power to make decisions  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:49):**  about food growing back into the hands of small scale farmers who aren't backed by  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:52):**  multi-millionaire investors.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:55):**  You said there's a big investment in farming technology at the moment but what you're talking  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:17:59):**  about I sense is very different to that.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  Yeah well we talk a lot about appropriate technology and there is a start up sector  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:07):**  in ag technology but that start up sector is often oriented if it's got money behind  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:14):**  it and it's elaborate tech, it's often oriented towards being purchased by the large players  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:21):**  in the sector and those large players are chemical companies and tractor companies.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:27):**  One of the big articles that came out last year in the Wired magazine was that farmers  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:32):**  are not allowed to get under the hood of their tractors anymore because it's all proprietary,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:36):**  has to go into a dealership, you have to have a fob.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  So there's major issues to do with food sovereignty when you're not allowed to repair your own  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:45):**  tractor.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:46):**  I can imagine that tech and design and Farmhack would really appeal to younger farmers.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:51):**  I wondered how it works with linking up older farmers, how older farmers are responding  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:57):**  to it.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:18:58):**  Well, younger farmers are the ones with less money so that's a powerful incentive for invention.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:05):**  The older farmers often have a lot of equipment and often have a lot of tools, like a shop  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:12):**  on their land where they have been tooling, fixing their machinery for a long time and  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:18):**  have a lot of skill and knowledge and experience and just mechanical intuition which they many  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:26):**  times are excited to share.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:28):**  So part of the role of the organizer and the social work that is involved in this is to  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  do with setting up the circumstances and making the hot soup appear on time and getting the  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:40):**  word out to help those new farmers get in connection with and access to and dialogue  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:48):**  with the older and experienced farmers.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:51):**  With the amazing success of the first UK Farmhack in Devon last year, I asked Severin what she  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:19:57):**  thought the future would hold for the movement in this country.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:00):**  I know even in normal conventional agricultural circles they're talking about only 100 more  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:05):**  harvests, that the soil health in this country is declining, plummeting, that the soil is  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:11):**  ill, the soil has been abused and misused and one of the great projects of humankind  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:18):**  is to heal and repair the health of our soil.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:24):**  Obviously organic agriculture is one of the primary tactics and many of the people in  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:29):**  our community are very, very motivated to get into agriculture for the precise reason  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:34):**  of repairing the land and repairing our relationship with the land and farming properly and sustainably  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:41):**  like in a way that will be sustainable, that will sustain us.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:45):**  So that shouldn't only be a counterculture, that really is for everyone.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:50):**  When it works it makes for good friendships, friendships based around good work to make  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:56):**  good farming possible.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:20:58):**  We know many of you have already heard of it, especially those of you listening in the  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:01):**  US, but we really need to spread the word so more Farmhacks can happen up and down the  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:07):**  UK.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:08):**  Reniton, the juniper spread, and Cookson fell, the alder burning, Craigendallach, the oakwood  
**[0:21:22-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:22):**  crag, Coral Ewish, the Scotts pine cori, the willow ridge.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:38):**  Place names aid habitat restoration.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:45):**  Finally Nigel headed to London for the Farmers for Action march late last month, billed as  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  a celebration of farming.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:20):**  I am sure you would agree that people who have given their life to producing food for  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  the British population and who have contributed financially to our treasury certainly deserve  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:34):**  to know where their destiny lies.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  To march to number 10 down in street and you know we're all basically showing our support  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:41):**  in British agriculture.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:43):**  We're here today representing every single sector, not dairy, every single sector.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:52):**  Why?  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  Because a cereal producer with a cost of production of 130 and sell it for 90 doesn't work.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  For a pig farmer, a sheep farmer, a beef farmer, all have to earn a business, a profit.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:09):**  Mainly stems from the supermarkets just driving down the prices, cuts our margins.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:14):**  The problem is we have too much product coming in from Europe and all over the world, which  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:20):**  is we need some of it but we don't need all of it.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  Over supply.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:24):**  Over supply, milk is an oversupply, beef is an oversupply.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:27):**  We're bringing far too much of everything in and we need to control it and we need to  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:32):**  have a total food security and that's why British is best because we can't control what  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:38):**  comes in.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:39):**  Red tractor is what it's all about as well.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:41):**  It helps the public to understand that if something carries the red tractor it means  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:47):**  it's made and produced and farmed in Britain.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:52):**  I do not want to walk through a graveyard and look at gravestones reading rest in peace  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:58):**  British agriculture.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:23:59):**  I believe that there is no point in looking back.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  We must continue to move forward and increasing our responsibilities for our produce and strengthening  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  relationships with our buyers.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:11):**  We also need a government who will listen to us and that is the reason why we are in  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:16):**  London today.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  People don't realise what work goes into producing the food that they eat and how much effort  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:24):**  it takes to grow food, whether that be crops or whether that be livestock, people don't  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:28):**  realise.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:29):**  We all need to stick together.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  We all need to work with each other.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:35):**  We don't have to get in bed at night with each other but we need to work together as  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  an industry.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:40):**  Fair trade should start in the UK rather than, it's very important to go international with  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:47):**  fair trade but I think we do need to start in the UK before we go elsewhere.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  Food is too cheap, far too cheap at the moment.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:56):**  We throw too much away.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:24:57):**  If food was more expensive less would be wasted.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:01):**  Innovation is what we need and this will be the future of our British agricultural industries.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:08):**  Let's work together, let's encourage each other and let's respect guidance from our  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:14):**  peers.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  Moe a nan cib, the root moss.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:20):**  Moe a tebich, the eerie moss or the ghostly moss.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:30):**  A nan can hold on to a ruin or patch of hillside but a nan cannot hold on to nothing.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:42):**  The lyrical excerpts dotted throughout the show today are a sneak peek from the Land  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  Rights Night at Soil City, crafted by Scottish artist and poet Alec Finlay.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:51):**  They are an eco-poetic guide to Scottish landscapes based on place names and their meanings which  
**[0:25:57-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:25:57):**  illuminate lost ways of life and questions our future relationship to the land.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:07):**  Place names describe a vast bi-regional network, a blend of concrete realities and totemic symbols,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:17):**  wildcats and wolves, pinewoods and birches, rock and ling.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:32):**  From a grasp of the meanings that names hold there follows place awareness, populating  
**[0:26:41-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:41):**  the wilderness of heather and rock with new colours and textures, biotic relationships,  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:52):**  lore and records of past use and the potential of future use.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:26:59):**  When you see a flush of green on a heather moor, look for the bumps of an old sheeling.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:07):**  There were people here in the summer and there was cowshit, the soil was once tended.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:18):**  Cruea, this crea, the broken harp summer pasture.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:28):**  No cruea no hon honcha, no cruea no hon honcha, the one night summer pasture knull.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:39):**  Names remind us how the people-less wilderness was once tended.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  They offer a guide to the stewardship of the land.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:52):**  You can hear more from Alec and the Soil City Adventures in our field report from the event  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:56):**  which will be coming very soon.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  We're kind of excited about that.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:28:02):**  And thank you for listening, we couldn't do this without you.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:28:07):**  See you next time!  
**[0:28:09-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/09-farmerama#t=0:28:09):**  Bye!

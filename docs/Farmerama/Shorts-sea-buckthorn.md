**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:00):**  Chinese grow something like two million hectares of it and they're putting in about 150,000  hectares a year. Germany they started to grow it particularly in the 40s post-war for its  vitamin C to give to the population. It's grown in France, it's called Lagusia in France. One  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:26):**  of the issues about sea buckthorn, possibly why it's not widely known, is every country calls it  something different. Part of this is the fact that sea buckthorn is not just sea buckthorn,  sea buckthorn is six different species and 13 different subspecies. It'll grow into a 20 meter  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:42):**  tree or be a dwarf plant growing in the Arctic. It grows five and a half thousand meters up in  the Himalayas. It will grow in cold deserts in Tajikistan. It's been farmed in Canada since the  60s and 70s. The Americans are growing a little bit. It's grown in Bolivia. The Russians have been  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:03):**  growing it since 1933. Lisubenko was started in 1933 and if you go to any state in Russia,  in the Russian Federation, every Academy of Sciences has got its sea buckthorn growing  research program. It took 18 months for the University of East Anglia to establish a  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:19):**  collaborative agreement with Lisubenko. 2011-12 the first plants arrived and from then on over  the next four years we had small groups of plants arriving every year. The farm hasn't chosen what  varieties we are given. Lisubenko has approximately 29 registered varieties and about 43 on test at  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:41):**  any time. So we've basically got a mix of Chiskaya, which is the old Russian classic, which you'll  find right across the whole Asian continent, and then many more of the much more modern varieties.  The varieties that they are developing have effectively grown out the thorns which are  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:01):**  classic with sea buckthorn. There are bigger berry so that you can pick them. They've actually got  a stalk where the classic sea buckthorn berry doesn't, which is why you can't pick it. They've  grown it as a sweeter berry so that it's given it more bark at diversity and the whole of that  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:18):**  complex has actually given us hopefully a marketable product. If you go to Scandinavia,  Nomm Restaurant started the Nordic cuisine and that's where sea buckthorn as part of the chef's  world started to raise its head. It is quite a sharp flavor but it's a citrus flavor and it's  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:39):**  one that makes wonderful ice creams. You can use it with pork, with chicken, with fish. It is quite  a wide range. You've just got to use your imagination. But it is a new ingredient and in  the world that we live in of course, particularly in the catering industry, you know margins are  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:57):**  tight, budgets are tight and to actually get a new ingredient introduced is something which has to  come with a level of confidence. So from my perspective this year, which is our first crop,  we're looking at getting it into the London market really just as a trial. Getting people  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:15):**  just to try the taste, play with it, see what they feel they can do with it. In terms of its  wider market, there are industries abroad linked to sea buckthorn farming which are producing oils,  particularly for the natural cosmetic market. Germany is very very strong on that. You go into  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:35):**  China and there are huge amounts of investment going into sea buckthorn to produce oils which  are appearing on the internet. So this isn't a case of there's no national competition but there's  huge international competition. Having said there's international competition, the product actually  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:53):**  that we're growing, I would suggest, is different to anybody else's because we've got a fresh offering  to start with and because that fresh offering then even as a frozen product is coming straight  off the bush, I think our taste, our flavour is going to be different to anything that can be  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:11):**  imported from abroad. There is of course, you know, with competition there is a worry that these big  sea buckthorn estates can bring a product in cheaper than anybody else. Germany, where they've  been growing sea buckthorn for 30 or 40 years, have developed a big harvester. Kranemann have  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:30):**  built a mechanical harvester which requires about 50 hectares to be economically viable. It's half a  million euros a beast so they are going into it in quite a big way but that's going to the local  market. It's not coming into the UK market. We're a tiny business and we're moving with an innovative  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:49):**  crop with a product that's never been developed before. Hence you go into the marketplace and  every step you take is tentative. We don't have lots of money behind us therefore we've got to be  careful with what we do but one of the problems that I found with trying to develop a product for  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:10):**  the market is regulation is very much a barrier. The food industry is designed for big business,  not for small business. If I want to sell even fresh berry into the marketplace I've got to  comply with extensive hygiene regulations. Now that's not to say that I'm not going to produce  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:29):**  the most hygienic crop and most of it is down to common sense. We spent money on consultants that  hasn't actually delivered anything practical and now effectively the way that we're moving forward  is thinking that we understand what we're doing, making sure that we comply with specifications  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:53):**  which you would naturally expect to see with things like blueberry and strawberries and that  sort of thing. So it's a compatible product. It's going to go into clean pots. It's going to be  produced in a clean environment but I do find regulation a real worry and there are too many  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:09):**  people who are just there to take money off you. If you go back in into classical literature,  Pliny the Elder who was killed at Vesuvius in 79 AD, his natural history book has got a chapter on  sea buckthorn which actually says it was created by the gods for animals. We had our old Labrador  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:29):**  who sadly died a month ago but she had tumours through her which was diagnosed last June. We put  her on sea buckthorn and she built this massive coat on her and it did sort of give her a bit of  a lease of life. Personally I'm on the sea buckthorn capsules but then I wouldn't be wouldn't I? I would say  
**[0:06:51-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:51):**  though that three times a day I think that I do more work, it gives me stamina. That's my perspective.

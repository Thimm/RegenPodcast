**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:00):**  Chinese grow something like two million hectares of it and they're putting in about 150,000  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:13):**  hectares a year. Germany they started to grow it particularly in the 40s post-war for its  
**[0:00:19-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:19):**  vitamin C to give to the population. It's grown in France, it's called Lagusia in France. One  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:26):**  of the issues about sea buckthorn, possibly why it's not widely known, is every country calls it  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:31):**  something different. Part of this is the fact that sea buckthorn is not just sea buckthorn,  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:36):**  sea buckthorn is six different species and 13 different subspecies. It'll grow into a 20 meter  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:42):**  tree or be a dwarf plant growing in the Arctic. It grows five and a half thousand meters up in  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:48):**  the Himalayas. It will grow in cold deserts in Tajikistan. It's been farmed in Canada since the  
**[0:00:55-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:00:55):**  60s and 70s. The Americans are growing a little bit. It's grown in Bolivia. The Russians have been  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:03):**  growing it since 1933. Lisubenko was started in 1933 and if you go to any state in Russia,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:09):**  in the Russian Federation, every Academy of Sciences has got its sea buckthorn growing  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:14):**  research program. It took 18 months for the University of East Anglia to establish a  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:19):**  collaborative agreement with Lisubenko. 2011-12 the first plants arrived and from then on over  
**[0:01:26-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:26):**  the next four years we had small groups of plants arriving every year. The farm hasn't chosen what  
**[0:01:33-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:33):**  varieties we are given. Lisubenko has approximately 29 registered varieties and about 43 on test at  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:41):**  any time. So we've basically got a mix of Chiskaya, which is the old Russian classic, which you'll  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:48):**  find right across the whole Asian continent, and then many more of the much more modern varieties.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:01:55):**  The varieties that they are developing have effectively grown out the thorns which are  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:01):**  classic with sea buckthorn. There are bigger berry so that you can pick them. They've actually got  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:06):**  a stalk where the classic sea buckthorn berry doesn't, which is why you can't pick it. They've  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:11):**  grown it as a sweeter berry so that it's given it more bark at diversity and the whole of that  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:18):**  complex has actually given us hopefully a marketable product. If you go to Scandinavia,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:24):**  Nomm Restaurant started the Nordic cuisine and that's where sea buckthorn as part of the chef's  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:32):**  world started to raise its head. It is quite a sharp flavor but it's a citrus flavor and it's  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:39):**  one that makes wonderful ice creams. You can use it with pork, with chicken, with fish. It is quite  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:44):**  a wide range. You've just got to use your imagination. But it is a new ingredient and in  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:51):**  the world that we live in of course, particularly in the catering industry, you know margins are  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:02:57):**  tight, budgets are tight and to actually get a new ingredient introduced is something which has to  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:03):**  come with a level of confidence. So from my perspective this year, which is our first crop,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:09):**  we're looking at getting it into the London market really just as a trial. Getting people  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:15):**  just to try the taste, play with it, see what they feel they can do with it. In terms of its  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:21):**  wider market, there are industries abroad linked to sea buckthorn farming which are producing oils,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:28):**  particularly for the natural cosmetic market. Germany is very very strong on that. You go into  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:35):**  China and there are huge amounts of investment going into sea buckthorn to produce oils which  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:41):**  are appearing on the internet. So this isn't a case of there's no national competition but there's  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:47):**  huge international competition. Having said there's international competition, the product actually  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:53):**  that we're growing, I would suggest, is different to anybody else's because we've got a fresh offering  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:03:58):**  to start with and because that fresh offering then even as a frozen product is coming straight  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:06):**  off the bush, I think our taste, our flavour is going to be different to anything that can be  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:11):**  imported from abroad. There is of course, you know, with competition there is a worry that these big  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:17):**  sea buckthorn estates can bring a product in cheaper than anybody else. Germany, where they've  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:25):**  been growing sea buckthorn for 30 or 40 years, have developed a big harvester. Kranemann have  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:30):**  built a mechanical harvester which requires about 50 hectares to be economically viable. It's half a  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:37):**  million euros a beast so they are going into it in quite a big way but that's going to the local  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:43):**  market. It's not coming into the UK market. We're a tiny business and we're moving with an innovative  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:49):**  crop with a product that's never been developed before. Hence you go into the marketplace and  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:04:55):**  every step you take is tentative. We don't have lots of money behind us therefore we've got to be  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:04):**  careful with what we do but one of the problems that I found with trying to develop a product for  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:10):**  the market is regulation is very much a barrier. The food industry is designed for big business,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:17):**  not for small business. If I want to sell even fresh berry into the marketplace I've got to  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:24):**  comply with extensive hygiene regulations. Now that's not to say that I'm not going to produce  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:29):**  the most hygienic crop and most of it is down to common sense. We spent money on consultants that  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:36):**  hasn't actually delivered anything practical and now effectively the way that we're moving forward  
**[0:05:43-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:43):**  is thinking that we understand what we're doing, making sure that we comply with specifications  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:53):**  which you would naturally expect to see with things like blueberry and strawberries and that  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:05:57):**  sort of thing. So it's a compatible product. It's going to go into clean pots. It's going to be  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:02):**  produced in a clean environment but I do find regulation a real worry and there are too many  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:09):**  people who are just there to take money off you. If you go back in into classical literature,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:15):**  Pliny the Elder who was killed at Vesuvius in 79 AD, his natural history book has got a chapter on  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:22):**  sea buckthorn which actually says it was created by the gods for animals. We had our old Labrador  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:29):**  who sadly died a month ago but she had tumours through her which was diagnosed last June. We put  
**[0:06:36-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:36):**  her on sea buckthorn and she built this massive coat on her and it did sort of give her a bit of  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:45):**  a lease of life. Personally I'm on the sea buckthorn capsules but then I wouldn't be wouldn't I? I would say  
**[0:06:51-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sea-buckthorn#t=0:06:51):**  though that three times a day I think that I do more work, it gives me stamina. That's my perspective.

**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:02:22):**  after for the whole time that I've been at Plaw Hatch.

**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:02:30):**  Natural fibre company, the only company that do it.

**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:02:37):**  can be processed.

**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:02:41):**  So that's all been quite challenging.

**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:02:55):**  or have created local food systems.

**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:04):**  I feel like there's a lot of people who have been really interested in creating better

**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:14):**  locally.

**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:19):**  At the moment, our idea with the South East England Fibershed is to create a directory

**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:30):**  We can save each other so much time if we know who to talk to.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:34):**  You can often have a problem and you keep thinking, oh, I just don't know who to ask.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:39):**  And actually to have a network and get designers who want to find good wool and farmers who  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:46):**  want to provide good wool together is a really exciting thing.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:50):**  They came down and they brought Patrick McDowell and a few other really great young designers.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:03:59):**  And they're becoming so disillusioned with it.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:01):**  I mean, all of them are saying they've done internships with big companies and they're  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:07):**  just horrified by the waste and the kinds of materials that are getting used and wanting  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:12):**  something different, but maybe also not knowing where to look for it.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:16):**  And I think it's just amazing for them to actually come to a farm and see how the decisions  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:21):**  they're making about what materials they're using can actually impact the land and can

**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:34):**  It can actually improve the land, not just kind of be all right or a bit good for it.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:41):**  It can actually be a helpful way to improve the land and another way to support farmers,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:47):**  I suppose.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:49):**  Because it is so dire, the situation with wool at the moment.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:04:51):**  I mean, we don't sell wool to the Wishes Wool Board, but if we did, it probably wouldn't

**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:03):**  a strange thing that people can't against shearing in the fashion industry, which is  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:10):**  very strange because as we all know, you have to shear sheep.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:14):**  It's necessary.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:15):**  It's a very big commitment to have wool spun.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:19):**  It's a very expensive thing to do.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:20):**  And I think that's one of the big things about getting designers involved early on in the  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:25):**  process is actually you need them to come, they need to be in there right at the beginning  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:30):**  to say, actually, this is what I want because otherwise you're laying out, like, I'm lucky  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:35):**  I'm part of this big mix farm.

**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:39):**  So there is always money that I could invest in having the wool processed.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:44):**  But if you're just a shepherd, I think it must be really challenging to, you're making  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:50):**  a sort of leap of faith in spending all this money on having the wool processed and being  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:05:55):**  unsure about if you can actually sell it.

**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:03):**  involved is if someone can come to you and say, I really would love to have this spec  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:09):**  of wool and it's have this staple length, it needs to be this particular colour.

**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:19):**  it.

**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:24):**  another, it's another thing to do really.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:28):**  And it's not directly to do with looking after sheep.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:32):**  Yeah, it's interesting actually because this cereal series that has just been done on Farmerama,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:38):**  that was really fascinating about cereals, but I thought so much of it applies to wool.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:43):**  There is just this lack of processes, you know, that's really, really essential that  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:47):**  we have processes, people who actually are milling wool, not just milling wheat.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:52):**  And yeah, I think that we've lost so much of that, but it's amazing that it's coming  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:06:58):**  back and I think it's great just having all these, we had a little meeting last night  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:03):**  with the South West Fibre Shed and I was there and a few other people came who were shepherds  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:08):**  or interested in it.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:09):**  And yeah, it's just great to have those conversations and make those connections and yeah, it feels  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:15):**  like it's going to take off.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah I guess with the sheep enterprise, by processing wool and sheepskins, I sort of  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:26):**  add a third onto my turnover.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:30):**  And I think my idea with sheep, it's actually, it can be better to have less sheep and get  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:36):**  more value from each sheep than to have just lots of sheep.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:40):**  And having less sheep maybe allows you that time to go to the abattoir and get the sheepskins  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:45):**  and salt them and send them off and sell them.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:48):**  And that actually is a big added income.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:51):**  For me, I really want to use every bit of our sheep.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:07:55):**  I feel like that's kind of our responsibility as people that are raising animals for meat,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:02):**  that actually there shouldn't be any waste.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:05):**  And we're very lucky because we have two local abattoirs.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:09):**  Our sheep always go through the same one.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:11):**  And it is an hour round trip for me to go and get the sheepskins.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:15):**  So I take the sheep in the morning and I go back at lunchtime and get them and bring them  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:19):**  home and salt them and then post them off to the Welsh Organic Tannery.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:24):**  But we can make enough of a margin on them that it's worthwhile to do that.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:30):**  And we also have our own butchery, so the animals will come back to the butchery.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:34):**  And I think Jane once took a picture for me of the waste.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:38):**  And I mean, it's not even waste because she gives the dog, but it's like just a handful  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:43):**  of meat because we sell all the bones and all of the meat and even do stuff with any  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:08:49):**  excess fat from the use.

**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:05):**  And then when we think about the cafeteria, the cafeteria is a phenomenal opportunity  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:08):**  that exists in pretty much all of our communities here in the United States.

**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:31):**  which then also connects them to their greater community.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:34):**  We're partnering with the community of Stockton, California, to reimagine their school meal  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:40):**  experience.

**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:45):**  the mayor of Stockton, Mayor Michael Tubbs.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:47):**  He's a phenomenal guy and a funder.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:49):**  And Alice was doing what she does best, which is feeding the idea, feeding a concept to  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:53):**  a group of people.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:55):**  And so that day she was feeding school lunch.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:19:57):**  And Mayor Tubbs tried the meal and he said he wanted this for all of his kids in Stockton.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:02):**  And so from that, we received grant funding to partner with the community of Stockton  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:06):**  to reimagine the food experiences on campus in the south side of Stockton.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:11):**  So when we think about the south side of Stockton, it has about 13 schools, K through 8 and high  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:16):**  schools, as well as I think two grocery stores, but they're on opposite ends of the region.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:22):**  And the mindset is that surrounding Stockton is a rich agricultural area.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:28):**  So it's in the Central Valley region where so much food for the United States and the  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:31):**  world is grown, but so much of that food leaves Stockton and it never makes it back into the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:35):**  community or into the schools.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:37):**  So we're partnering with the community to think about how we can get that food that's  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:41):**  grown by organic, regenerative farms into the schools.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:45):**  The mindset is that we have this opportunity to imagine together and to design a program  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:52):**  where we not only procure food from local and regional farms who are taking care of  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:20:58):**  their workers and taking care of the land, but we also have an opportunity to think about  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:03):**  how we leverage the cafeteria as a place for learning.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:06):**  So imagine if you walked into your cafeteria and it was an experience that taught you about  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:10):**  nourishment, about stewardship of the land.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:13):**  What if you followed the pathway of a seed on the ground as you went to get your lunch?  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:18):**  And what if it also just served as a place to build community?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:21):**  And so that's what we're working with the community of Stockton to think about.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:24):**  And we're working with them, we're not just doing it for them, and because the best ideas  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:28):**  exist there.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:29):**  And so we want to make sure that all the funding that we have is leveraged by the community  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:34):**  of Stockton.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:36):**  In terms of where we're at with the project in Stockton, California, we've been hosting  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:39):**  a series of community dinners so we can all gather around a meal, an organic, locally  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:44):**  sourced meal, and talk about what the community wants and needs from not only a school lunch  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:50):**  program but from a school food experience.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:52):**  So we've hosted two dinners so far.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:55):**  We've been attending a lot of events, a lot of church gatherings, a lot of 5K runs.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:21:59):**  And each time we go, we bring food from a local farm so that way we can tell the story  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:04):**  of that food and where the food comes from.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:06):**  One of my favorite stories right now is of a young man named Caleb.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:10):**  At our last community dinner, which we host at community centers that are located in the  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:15):**  neighborhoods which we're meant to serve.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:18):**  And Caleb, he got there early and he was playing basketball with one of his friends who had  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:22):**  come to the first community dinner.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:24):**  And Caleb did not like to smile.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:28):**  He didn't want to engage very much with me.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:30):**  And I was trying to tell jokes.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:32):**  I was trying to talk to him about basketball.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:33):**  And he had nothing to do with me.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:35):**  And so I just paused and I realized we had grapes.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:38):**  A local organic farmer from Logierre Ranches had just dropped off a harvest of Bronx grapes.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:44):**  These grapes are just phenomenal in terms of flavor and taste and texture.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:49):**  And she just dropped them off.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:50):**  And so I knew I had them in the kitchen.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:52):**  And I just, I went up to him and I was like, do you want to try the best grape of your  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:56):**  life?  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:57):**  And he was like, I don't know.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:22:59):**  Sure, I'll do it.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:00):**  So I ran to the kitchen because I knew I only had a few moments before he left.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:03):**  And I came back with a little handful of grapes.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:06):**  And so I held out the grapes and he picked one off and put it in his mouth and began  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:11):**  to taste it.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:13):**  And as he began to taste it, he began to smile.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:16):**  But it wasn't just like a sly smile.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:18):**  It was a joyful smile.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:20):**  And in that moment, I knew that not only have we provided him with a wonderful experience,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:25):**  a beautiful experience, but we had also provided him with an opportunity to taste a flavor  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:31):**  he had never tried before.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:32):**  An opportunity to develop a positive food memory.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:35):**  So a moment that he's going to look back on, a moment that he's going to be able to use  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:39):**  to define future moments in terms of his choices that he makes around food.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:44):**  In terms of the taste that he's willing to go and try and explore.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:47):**  And so in that moment, it was a resounding affirmation that this work is valuable, it's  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:23:53):**  needed and a resource exists all around of our communities.

**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:24:29):**  And our work is just meant to connect those dots to create a new system.

**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerma-57-episode-57-fibreshed-uk-chestnuts-the-edible-schoolyard-and-welsh-poetry#t=0:25:01):**  It seems like the perfect resource, the perfect way to leverage all this beautiful food that

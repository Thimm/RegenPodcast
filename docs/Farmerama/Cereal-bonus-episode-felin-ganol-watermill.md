**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:00):**  I'm Anne Parry and I guess I'm the miller at Vellinganol Watermill, which is probably  
**[0:00:06-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:06):**  why we're having this conversation.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:13):**  Welcome to Serial from Farmerama. This is a bonus episode featuring an extended interview  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:20):**  with Anne Parry of Vellinganol Watermill.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:24):**  So Vellinganol is a 17th century watermill in West Wales in a village called Llanristed,  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:32):**  which is about eight miles south of Aberystwyth on the coast. The name Vellinganol in Welsh  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:38):**  means middle mill, it's not quite as glamorous as it sounds if you don't speak the language.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:43):**  It's one of what were four watermills in the village. It hadn't worked since the 1950s  
**[0:00:49-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:49):**  and we came to live here in 2006. My elderly mother was living close by to us but was beginning  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:57):**  to need a bit more care so we began as a family to look for a place which had an attached  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:01):**  cottage and Vellinganol just happened to be on the market and it's got a house about three  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:08):**  and a half acres of woodland and garden and an attached cottage and that's what brought  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:12):**  us here. And the mill was like a bonus really, there were just these amazing sort of buildings  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:18):**  that look as if they've been closed down years ago and nothing had happened very much but  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:22):**  there was amazing space and wonderful light in it and all this fascinating machinery shrouded  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:27):**  in dust and yeah, but fortunately I think the owner saw that we really liked it and  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:31):**  would probably keep it as it was, whereas somebody else who was interested in it was  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:34):**  going to convert the mill, or was looking to convert the mill into holiday accommodation.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:39):**  So actually us falling in love with it worked in our favour. So 2006 we came here and weren't  
**[0:01:45-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:45):**  expecting to be millers at all. Why then did you decide to restore the mill? Again, because  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:53):**  it was there. When we came, as I say, it hadn't worked since the 50s and we didn't really  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:57):**  know what we'd done beyond thinking the place was interesting. The water wheel was intact  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:04):**  but wouldn't turn and there was an old mill pond which only filled with water when there  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:08):**  was a flood in the river. And I say to people when I show them around the mill, you know,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:14):**  you can't actually live with an empty mill pond by a river without wondering whether  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:17):**  you can get water back into it or not. So we kind of spent the first year playing about  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:21):**  and damming it, damming the river a bit and getting the water back towards the sluice  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:24):**  gate and managing to fill the pond. And then one thing kind of led to another really, we  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:29):**  got a full mill pond and then we looked and wondered whether we could get the water wheel  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:32):**  to turn and somewhere in the middle of that Andy, my husband, took early retirement and  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:38):**  once the water wheel had turned, we'd got very into it by then and we're just fascinated  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:43):**  to see whether we could actually make the whole kit work again. Yeah, so we had one  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:47):**  pair of millstones working by the beginning of 2009. We finally got everything to turn  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:54):**  again. I think if somebody had said to us we've got to get the mill working when we  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:58):**  came, we probably wouldn't have bought it because it seemed daunting. It was only because  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:02):**  we took that sort of step by step approach wondering what would happen next. We actually  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:08):**  got going again really I think.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:10):**  And did you have any experience in that kind of area before?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:15):**  There's a lot of serendipity involved really. Andy used to restore old cars so he had kind  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:21):**  of an interest, a mechanical interest and a fascination with it. We hadn't milled but  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:27):**  he got the kit going and I was, once upon a time, I worked in agricultural research  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:33):**  and cereals research and afterwards did quite a lot of baking so I had quite an interest  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:38):**  in the whole grain and baking side of it as well and lots of skills and interest fed back  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:43):**  into it so we were quite lucky really. But actual milling, no, we just talked to everybody  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:49):**  we possibly could and went round every mill we possibly could and bored everybody to death  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:53):**  about it and went on a very steep learning curve really.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:57):**  And so once you'd actually embarked or once you'd decided this was something you wanted  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:01):**  to do, what did that actually entail? What kind of work did you actually have to do?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:06):**  Actually to actually just get the water wheel turning was a fairly mammoth task because  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:09):**  we had to replace a massive stone bearing which took a lot of thinking about and sorting  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:14):**  out and it involved a series of jacks and some complicated lifting that Andy became  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:19):**  quite adept at. We got the bearing replaced there and then inside all the machinery was  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:24):**  there. That was the good thing about restoring this mill, it had belonged to the same family  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:28):**  for generations. So what had happened was as the family aged the mill had just been  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:32):**  closed down. A lot of old mills you lost a lot of the kit because they were broken up  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:37):**  and dispersed and bits sold off but everything was there so really what we had to do was  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:42):**  just replace everything that was worn and it was very worn and do a lot of restoration  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:47):**  of woodwork which was worm eaten and rotted beyond repair and certainly beyond any kind  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:53):**  of public health consideration. So we just did that a piece at a time. One of our sons  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:58):**  came back to live at home having decided that he might want to be a carpenter so he was  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:02):**  invaluable because he did a lot of the woodwork as well with Andy. At that point we got it  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:08):**  to work and then we sort of had to think about what we meant to do with it because I mean  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:12):**  so many mills are restored and you know so what. That was when we started asking ourselves  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:18):**  bigger questions about what it was all about.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:20):**  How did you then decide that you did want to go into production? You know that you didn't  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:28):**  want to just be a sort of tourist attraction I suppose or a kind of curiosity that you  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:34):**  actually wanted to mill flower?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:35):**  As I said that was when we started asking ourselves questions about that. I mean the  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:40):**  tourist attraction thing it's because it's part of the house well it's attached to the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:44):**  side of the house and whilst it's lovely to show people it it's not robust enough or big  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:49):**  enough to take a constant stream of tourists and we didn't really want to share our home  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:54):**  in that way. We like to show them the mill but we didn't want to start a job just showing  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:59):**  people around the mill but it fitted so much with kind of sort of yeah just the whole ethic  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:05):**  of it. It seemed to me that I've been around lots of old mills and people are thrilled  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:10):**  that the machinery works and so they'll put any old week through and produce a powder  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:15):**  with it and that's it and I felt that if the mill had anything to give to people and if  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:21):**  stone milling was as good as it was supposed to be then we ought to be able to produce  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:24):**  decent flour. So that was really when I kind of took over from Andy a bit there and started  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:30):**  chasing about different weights and thinking about the milling properly and thinking that  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:34):**  it actually needed to it needed to at least earn its keep a little bit because you know  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:38):**  we'd not had any funding to to restore it so we needed it needed it to at least sell  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:43):**  a bit of flour.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:44):**  Could you tell me a bit actually about that process then of researching the grain and  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:50):**  deciding where to source from? You mentioned you have a bit of a background in that area.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:57):**  Well yeah yeah so as I said I worked as a cereal pathologist it sounds really weird  
**[0:07:04-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:04):**  cereal as in grains. Yes I looked at grain diseases so I had quite and had always been  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:12):**  interested in organic growing and all that kind of thing so I had that sort of background  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:16):**  and then over the years I've done a lot of baking as well. I'm of the generation in the  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:20):**  1970s where we all we all clutched our Tassajara bread books and did a lot of whole food and  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:26):**  organic things so yeah I was yeah I was kind of I knew where I was looking for the sorts  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:31):**  of things I wanted to do. Yeah initially because we'd never milled before the first thing we  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:36):**  did besides being determined that we were going to mill organic grain was to buy just  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:40):**  what we understood to be decent milling wheat because when we did produce flour I didn't  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:44):**  want it to be the wheat's fault. If it didn't work well it had to be our technique that  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:49):**  needed improving. So we just went to an organic grain merchant and bought straight milling  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:54):**  wheat which we were told performed well and when we when we kind of got to grips with  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:00):**  that our ambition was to do what the mill always did which was to to mill locally grown  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:05):**  grains and that was kind of when I came up against a dead halt because the idea of growing  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:12):**  anything that might be decent milling wheat in West Wales has long been forgotten really  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:15):**  people just assume that it's wet that the fields are small that any kind of wheat that  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:20):**  you grew wouldn't be up to it and any farmers who do grow they grow for feed wheat they  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:24):**  rarely they rarely think that their grain meets milling specifications so it wasn't  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:30):**  as straightforward as I'd hoped initially. What we have got here besides the mill being  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:35):**  fascinating is that we've got the old day books which show all the farmers in the area  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:40):**  because it was a tithe mill bringing their grain in to be milled and a hundred years  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:45):**  ago every farm in the area was growing wheat and was bringing it to be milled so I mean  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:50):**  it's not either people's tastes have changed radically and they were prepared to eat rubbish  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:54):**  bread or we needed to rethink the kind of grain that we were assuming was good milling  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:59):**  wheat and all these thoughts were chiming in very much I mean over the last 10 years  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:03):**  this is you know the zeitgeist really isn't it that's exactly what people have been looking  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:07):**  at and thinking so I was we were in a very good position really to to actually watch  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:11):**  and see what other people were doing and explore all this a bit more. Fortunately both Andy  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:19):**  and I before I gave up work with raising a family we'd worked at what used to be called  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:23):**  the Welsh plant breeding station but it's part of Aberystwyth University it's called  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:28):**  Ibers now Institute of Biological Environmental Research and we still we still had lots of  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:36):**  connections there and we persuaded them to be sufficiently interested to grow a couple  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:41):**  of acres on their organic land of wheat which we could just try milling with. So 2010 I  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:47):**  think 9-10 they put in a modern a modern spring wheat and harvested it and dried it for us  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:54):**  and it wouldn't have met any milling specifications as far as a big mill was concerned but it  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:59):**  was clean and wholesome and we milled it and it produced a really nice flower it didn't  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:04):**  rise hugely but it had a wonderful aroma and really good taste and we managed to market  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:10):**  then that locally as a local flower which as I say because because people had this idea  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:15):**  you couldn't grow wheat locally the people were thrilled about that gave us a bit of  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:19):**  confidence then to start to start talking to people and talking to other farmers and  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:24):**  looking to see what we could do and it's been that steady build-up then of people getting  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:28):**  together and the more people we've met you know it knocks on so that this year 10 years  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:35):**  since we've been milling and selling flower our neighbouring farmer just a couple of hundred  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:40):**  yards up the road he came to us in the autumn and said well I've done it then it's in for  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:43):**  you and he's actually put a field in of winter wheat so we will all be well this autumn we  
**[0:10:49-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:49):**  will be literally milling hyper local wheat which is really quite exciting.

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:00):**  I'm Anne Parry and I guess I'm the miller at Vellinganol Watermill, which is probably  why we're having this conversation.  Welcome to Serial from Farmerama. This is a bonus episode featuring an extended interview  
**[0:00:20-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:20):**  with Anne Parry of Vellinganol Watermill.  So Vellinganol is a 17th century watermill in West Wales in a village called Llanristed,  which is about eight miles south of Aberystwyth on the coast. The name Vellinganol in Welsh  
**[0:00:38-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:38):**  means middle mill, it's not quite as glamorous as it sounds if you don't speak the language.  It's one of what were four watermills in the village. It hadn't worked since the 1950s  and we came to live here in 2006. My elderly mother was living close by to us but was beginning  
**[0:00:57-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:00:57):**  to need a bit more care so we began as a family to look for a place which had an attached  cottage and Vellinganol just happened to be on the market and it's got a house about three  and a half acres of woodland and garden and an attached cottage and that's what brought  
**[0:01:12-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:12):**  us here. And the mill was like a bonus really, there were just these amazing sort of buildings  that look as if they've been closed down years ago and nothing had happened very much but  there was amazing space and wonderful light in it and all this fascinating machinery shrouded  
**[0:01:27-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:27):**  in dust and yeah, but fortunately I think the owner saw that we really liked it and  would probably keep it as it was, whereas somebody else who was interested in it was  going to convert the mill, or was looking to convert the mill into holiday accommodation.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:39):**  So actually us falling in love with it worked in our favour. So 2006 we came here and weren't  expecting to be millers at all. Why then did you decide to restore the mill? Again, because  it was there. When we came, as I say, it hadn't worked since the 50s and we didn't really  
**[0:01:57-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:01:57):**  know what we'd done beyond thinking the place was interesting. The water wheel was intact  but wouldn't turn and there was an old mill pond which only filled with water when there  was a flood in the river. And I say to people when I show them around the mill, you know,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:14):**  you can't actually live with an empty mill pond by a river without wondering whether  you can get water back into it or not. So we kind of spent the first year playing about  and damming it, damming the river a bit and getting the water back towards the sluice  
**[0:02:24-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:24):**  gate and managing to fill the pond. And then one thing kind of led to another really, we  got a full mill pond and then we looked and wondered whether we could get the water wheel  to turn and somewhere in the middle of that Andy, my husband, took early retirement and  
**[0:02:38-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:38):**  once the water wheel had turned, we'd got very into it by then and we're just fascinated  to see whether we could actually make the whole kit work again. Yeah, so we had one  pair of millstones working by the beginning of 2009. We finally got everything to turn  
**[0:02:54-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:02:54):**  again. I think if somebody had said to us we've got to get the mill working when we  came, we probably wouldn't have bought it because it seemed daunting. It was only because  we took that sort of step by step approach wondering what would happen next. We actually  
**[0:03:08-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:08):**  got going again really I think.  And did you have any experience in that kind of area before?  There's a lot of serendipity involved really. Andy used to restore old cars so he had kind  
**[0:03:21-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:21):**  of an interest, a mechanical interest and a fascination with it. We hadn't milled but  he got the kit going and I was, once upon a time, I worked in agricultural research  and cereals research and afterwards did quite a lot of baking so I had quite an interest  
**[0:03:38-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:38):**  in the whole grain and baking side of it as well and lots of skills and interest fed back  into it so we were quite lucky really. But actual milling, no, we just talked to everybody  we possibly could and went round every mill we possibly could and bored everybody to death  
**[0:03:53-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:03:53):**  about it and went on a very steep learning curve really.  And so once you'd actually embarked or once you'd decided this was something you wanted  to do, what did that actually entail? What kind of work did you actually have to do?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:06):**  Actually to actually just get the water wheel turning was a fairly mammoth task because  we had to replace a massive stone bearing which took a lot of thinking about and sorting  out and it involved a series of jacks and some complicated lifting that Andy became  
**[0:04:19-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:19):**  quite adept at. We got the bearing replaced there and then inside all the machinery was  there. That was the good thing about restoring this mill, it had belonged to the same family  for generations. So what had happened was as the family aged the mill had just been  
**[0:04:32-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:32):**  closed down. A lot of old mills you lost a lot of the kit because they were broken up  and dispersed and bits sold off but everything was there so really what we had to do was  just replace everything that was worn and it was very worn and do a lot of restoration  
**[0:04:47-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:04:47):**  of woodwork which was worm eaten and rotted beyond repair and certainly beyond any kind  of public health consideration. So we just did that a piece at a time. One of our sons  came back to live at home having decided that he might want to be a carpenter so he was  
**[0:05:02-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:02):**  invaluable because he did a lot of the woodwork as well with Andy. At that point we got it  to work and then we sort of had to think about what we meant to do with it because I mean  so many mills are restored and you know so what. That was when we started asking ourselves  
**[0:05:18-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:18):**  bigger questions about what it was all about.  How did you then decide that you did want to go into production? You know that you didn't  want to just be a sort of tourist attraction I suppose or a kind of curiosity that you  
**[0:05:34-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:34):**  actually wanted to mill flower?  As I said that was when we started asking ourselves questions about that. I mean the  tourist attraction thing it's because it's part of the house well it's attached to the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:44):**  side of the house and whilst it's lovely to show people it it's not robust enough or big  enough to take a constant stream of tourists and we didn't really want to share our home  in that way. We like to show them the mill but we didn't want to start a job just showing  
**[0:05:59-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:05:59):**  people around the mill but it fitted so much with kind of sort of yeah just the whole ethic  of it. It seemed to me that I've been around lots of old mills and people are thrilled  that the machinery works and so they'll put any old week through and produce a powder  
**[0:06:15-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:15):**  with it and that's it and I felt that if the mill had anything to give to people and if  stone milling was as good as it was supposed to be then we ought to be able to produce  decent flour. So that was really when I kind of took over from Andy a bit there and started  
**[0:06:30-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:30):**  chasing about different weights and thinking about the milling properly and thinking that  it actually needed to it needed to at least earn its keep a little bit because you know  we'd not had any funding to to restore it so we needed it needed it to at least sell  
**[0:06:43-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:43):**  a bit of flour.  Could you tell me a bit actually about that process then of researching the grain and  deciding where to source from? You mentioned you have a bit of a background in that area.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:06:57):**  Well yeah yeah so as I said I worked as a cereal pathologist it sounds really weird  cereal as in grains. Yes I looked at grain diseases so I had quite and had always been  interested in organic growing and all that kind of thing so I had that sort of background  
**[0:07:16-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:16):**  and then over the years I've done a lot of baking as well. I'm of the generation in the  1970s where we all we all clutched our Tassajara bread books and did a lot of whole food and  organic things so yeah I was yeah I was kind of I knew where I was looking for the sorts  
**[0:07:31-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:31):**  of things I wanted to do. Yeah initially because we'd never milled before the first thing we  did besides being determined that we were going to mill organic grain was to buy just  what we understood to be decent milling wheat because when we did produce flour I didn't  
**[0:07:44-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:07:44):**  want it to be the wheat's fault. If it didn't work well it had to be our technique that  needed improving. So we just went to an organic grain merchant and bought straight milling  wheat which we were told performed well and when we when we kind of got to grips with  
**[0:08:00-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:00):**  that our ambition was to do what the mill always did which was to to mill locally grown  grains and that was kind of when I came up against a dead halt because the idea of growing  anything that might be decent milling wheat in West Wales has long been forgotten really  
**[0:08:15-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:15):**  people just assume that it's wet that the fields are small that any kind of wheat that  you grew wouldn't be up to it and any farmers who do grow they grow for feed wheat they  rarely they rarely think that their grain meets milling specifications so it wasn't  
**[0:08:30-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:30):**  as straightforward as I'd hoped initially. What we have got here besides the mill being  fascinating is that we've got the old day books which show all the farmers in the area  because it was a tithe mill bringing their grain in to be milled and a hundred years  
**[0:08:45-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:45):**  ago every farm in the area was growing wheat and was bringing it to be milled so I mean  it's not either people's tastes have changed radically and they were prepared to eat rubbish  bread or we needed to rethink the kind of grain that we were assuming was good milling  
**[0:08:59-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:08:59):**  wheat and all these thoughts were chiming in very much I mean over the last 10 years  this is you know the zeitgeist really isn't it that's exactly what people have been looking  at and thinking so I was we were in a very good position really to to actually watch  
**[0:09:11-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:11):**  and see what other people were doing and explore all this a bit more. Fortunately both Andy  and I before I gave up work with raising a family we'd worked at what used to be called  the Welsh plant breeding station but it's part of Aberystwyth University it's called  
**[0:09:28-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:28):**  Ibers now Institute of Biological Environmental Research and we still we still had lots of  connections there and we persuaded them to be sufficiently interested to grow a couple  of acres on their organic land of wheat which we could just try milling with. So 2010 I  
**[0:09:47-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:09:47):**  think 9-10 they put in a modern a modern spring wheat and harvested it and dried it for us  and it wouldn't have met any milling specifications as far as a big mill was concerned but it  was clean and wholesome and we milled it and it produced a really nice flower it didn't  
**[0:10:04-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:04):**  rise hugely but it had a wonderful aroma and really good taste and we managed to market  then that locally as a local flower which as I say because because people had this idea  you couldn't grow wheat locally the people were thrilled about that gave us a bit of  
**[0:10:19-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:19):**  confidence then to start to start talking to people and talking to other farmers and  looking to see what we could do and it's been that steady build-up then of people getting  together and the more people we've met you know it knocks on so that this year 10 years  
**[0:10:35-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:35):**  since we've been milling and selling flower our neighbouring farmer just a couple of hundred  yards up the road he came to us in the autumn and said well I've done it then it's in for  you and he's actually put a field in of winter wheat so we will all be well this autumn we  
**[0:10:49-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-felin-ganol-watermill#t=0:10:49):**  will be literally milling hyper local wheat which is really quite exciting.

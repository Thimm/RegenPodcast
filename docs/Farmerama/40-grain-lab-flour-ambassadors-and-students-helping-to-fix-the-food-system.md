**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to episode 40 of Farmerama.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:07):**  In the last month we've been to two events in the UK, so this episode is going to be  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:11):**  slightly different than usual.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:14):**  First, we've gone a little grain mad, so we'll be sharing many voices from the UK Grain Lab  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:20):**  in Nottingham.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:21):**  And then we jump across the Pennines to hear from students at an NUS Student Eats event  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:27):**  in Manchester.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:37):**  Earlier this month, Abbie went to Small Food Bakery, where the seeds of a grain revolution  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:42):**  were being sown.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:43):**  Over 120 bakers, farmers, millers, plant breeders, scientists and grain enthusiasts gathered  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:50):**  for UK Grain Lab to learn and share about the grain future we want to create, from seed  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:00:55):**  to loaf, and doughnuts, and actually rye gingerbread.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:01):**  In fact, just so many mind-blowingly delicious baked goods.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:06):**  Or so I heard from Abbie.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:10):**  I, Abbie Rose, do solemnly, happily swear that I'm going to tell everyone I see that  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:16):**  it's okay to love flour.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:20):**  Bread is not poison.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:21):**  Invisibility is poison.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:24):**  I will make visible all the labour in bread, from seed to mill, and mill to loaf.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:30):**  Because mills are the levers that farmers need to get new grains in the ground, and  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:36):**  under our butter again.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:38):**  The Grain Pledge was established in 2016 by Amy Halloran, author of The Bread Basket,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:44):**  and advocate of regional grain production in the US.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:48):**  Everyone at Grain Lab was invited to take part in the Grain Pledge, to recognise that  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:52):**  we are all part of this grain system, and we must act together.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:01:56):**  There's lots of videos of others doing this on the UK Grain Lab Instagram.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:01):**  Check it out.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:03):**  Kimberly Bell, owner and baker at Small Food Bakery, has been on a grain journey in recent  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:08):**  years.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:10):**  It all started when Hodma Dodds dropped off a taster of a special flour.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:15):**  It was made from a population of modern wheats, called the Wakelands population, also known  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:20):**  as YQ, that was bred by scientist Martin Wolf.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:25):**  The beauty of a population is that it's the opposite of a monoculture, in that it's  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:30):**  genetically diverse, and therefore adapts to local environments and changing climates,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:35):**  whilst building soil health.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:37):**  Basically, a population is very resilient, and ensures that farmers get a crop every  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:43):**  year.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:44):**  This is an incredibly innovative project, attracting attention from around the world.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:50):**  Martin and the team even had to get special permission from the EU to sell these seeds,  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:02:55):**  as seeds that change year on year are actually illegal to sell in the EU.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:01):**  That's a whole other story.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:02):**  Here's John Reid, who runs Redbeard Bakery in Melbourne, in Australia.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:07):**  Oh look, it's an incredibly exciting moment in my life, because I'm actually getting to  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:12):**  handle for the first time in my life this amazing, beautiful flour, which is the first  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:19):**  time I've ever had a go at a population weight.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:22):**  This is what's called YQ, it's the Wakeland population weight that's grown right here  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:28):**  in the UK.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:31):**  I think it's been talked about a lot on Farmerama.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:37):**  It is the future of farming, because it is what we need if we're going to survive climate  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:43):**  change and global warming, is we need adaptive crops that actually are not monocultures,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:48):**  and not specific variety driven, but actually population driven.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:03:53):**  That's the only way we'll actually get to the point of having... Diversity gives us  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:01):**  adaptability from season to season, year to year.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:05):**  We get this ability to change the population dynamics will change, and that'll help the  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:13):**  farmer because you'll always be able to harvest something.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:15):**  You won't have that bad year where you get nothing, you always get something, but it

**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:20):**  We as bakers have got to get used to the idea of change, and actually adapting ourselves.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:27):**  A big part of the Grain Lab was the baking workshops.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:31):**  Using these more diverse flours needs lots of experimentation, and so bakers were keen  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:35):**  to share tips and tricks.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:37):**  Kim has started investigating other forms of grain that allow more diversity and lower  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:42):**  input systems, which led her to Heritage Grains.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:45):**  John Letts is one of the key pioneers of Heritage Grains in the UK.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:49):**  He and a few others have been sending off the grains from seed banks around the world,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:53):**  and planting these very old varieties for years, building up seeds to a point where  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:04:58):**  they're now being grown commercially.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:00):**  I think there's a lot of debate in our community about the right way to move forward in terms  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:04):**  of should we be looking for old varieties?  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:09):**  Are the old varieties even old varieties?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:11):**  If we've taken five grams of seed from a gene bank and grind them up, if Martin's population  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:17):**  has been originally bred from modern wheat, does it really have genetic diversity?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:22):**  There's all this debate going on in our community, and I think the one thing we all agree on  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:26):**  is that genetic diversity is good.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:29):**  That's the starting point.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:30):**  It was kind of obvious to us that as a bakery, if we were going to use the YQ, we also should  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:35):**  use John's heritage population.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:37):**  We've become kind of obsessed with combining the two.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:40):**  I'll talk a little bit about ways in which we do that.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:43):**  This is the flour.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:44):**  We've got piles of it all over the place.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:45):**  I'm just going to pass it around and encourage you to taste it.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:50):**  It's quite interesting.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:52):**  Could you pass me that jar of wheat that's on the window?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:05:57):**  We keep this in the window which John gave me, which is from one of his fields.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:00):**  It's not quite everything that's in the population, but it's an example of diversity.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:04):**  We show this to our customers when we're talking about this product because you can literally  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:08):**  see some of the history of wheat in this.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:11):**  If you want to pass this around and have a look, it's just so beautiful.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:15):**  Every single one is different.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:18):**  When I saw what I see as our little pet project, the YQ, growing together with John's heritage  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:24):**  stuff which shows you like, I'm corn to Emma, right through to spelt, to all of the diversity  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:30):**  that he's ended up with by growing them together.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:32):**  It was just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in terms of a crop, I think.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:38):**  Here we are.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:39):**  We're back to the bakery.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:41):**  How are we going to use it?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:42):**  I think brioche is a really good starting point for using alternative flours.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:46):**  I think it's a brilliant showcase.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:47):**  Something with fat and it carries flavour.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:50):**  If you have something with butter in it, you can actually pull out the flavour of the flour  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:55):**  quite well.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:56):**  I think the flour tastes very cakey.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:06:59):**  That's one of the things I like about it and I think also makes fabulous doughnuts.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:02):**  I'm going to hand knead this because it's one of the differences between the Royal Emerald  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:10):**  Flour and the heritage flour.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:11):**  You need to be quite a lot more gentle with it.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:15):**  The next stage of this is going to go into a bulk while we go and have dinner and then  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:18):**  I'll pop back tonight and bung it in the fridge.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:20):**  In the morning, 8am, I'm going to be shaping them.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:22):**  If anyone wants to come and help, come and help over a coffee and we'll hopefully, if  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:27):**  everything works, fry them up tomorrow afternoon for a kind of farewell doughnut party.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:34):**  And then you get to taste them.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:37):**  It was clear at the gathering that we need to build food networks, not food chains.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:43):**  We need farmers, millers, bakers, breeders, all talking to each other, just like Kim has  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:48):**  done with Martin Wolf, John Letts, Mark Lee at Green Acres Farm and other farmers she  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:53):**  works with.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:07:56):**  Another brilliant example of this is E5 Bakehouse in London, who are great supporters of the  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:00):**  show.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:02):**  Here is Oscar Harding, farmer at Duchess Farms, and Ben McKinnon, owner and baker at E5 Bakehouse,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:09):**  to tell us about how a conventional farm ended up working with an organic bakery on a joint  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:14):**  learning journey.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:16):**  It's an arable farm, conventional farm in the most part, but over the last three years  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:21):**  it's been moving towards doing heritage crops with zero input and that journey has sort  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:28):**  of led to the start of a bit of a regenerative farming programme.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:33):**  That's kind of where I'm at today.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:35):**  It started really from achieving really good yields, one year 2013, 14, about that sort  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:43):**  of time, but a few years ago really good yields and the farm didn't make much money at all.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:47):**  I mean it had a bit to do with the price, the commodity price being low, but it also  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:51):**  had a lot to do with the input costs and writing essentially a huge cheque that the farm had  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:08:59):**  to write.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:00):**  I had to write every year for fertiliser and various sprays.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:03):**  I mean the sprayer would be out a lot, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and then the fert  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:09):**  spread is out a lot, so that's a bit of a vicious cycle.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:11):**  You feed the weeds with the fert, so that kind of led to thinking more about profit  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:17):**  per acre as opposed to tonnes per acre.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:19):**  Culturally amongst arable farmers it's all about how many tonnes per acre you get and  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:24):**  everyone wants to show off about that and no one talks about profit per acre.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:30):**  In Germany I think they're quite good at talking about profit per acre as opposed to tonnes  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:34):**  per acre, so that kind of got me thinking a bit more about that and once you start thinking  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:39):**  about profit per acre and realise that achieving massive yields doesn't necessarily equate  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:45):**  to that, then you have to rethink how you do that.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:48):**  So that's how I ended up finding out a bit about Heritage Reaper, but also we cold press  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:55):**  rapeseed oil.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:09:56):**  We've done that since 2012-13 and that sort of showcased adding value to acres.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:03):**  So you can have a tonne of seed or an acre and you get maybe a tonne, a tonne and a half  
**[0:10:08-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:08):**  of rapeseed off of your acre and sell it on a commodity market for £300-350 or do something  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:16):**  to it, bottle it, sell it and that acre effectively becomes hundreds of thousands.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:22):**  So that I suppose made me rethink and look at the acreage differently.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:27):**  And then in how to farm without input, you can't do that with modern dwarf wheat varieties,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:34):**  so Heritage Wheats came up, poking around on YouTube and stuff and so I met Ben and  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:42):**  then I was like, well look I want to farm this way and grow these kind of crops, would  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:45):**  you buy them if I did it?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:47):**  And he was like, yeah.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:48):**  So the next thing, a tonne of seed that he had arranged turned up at the farm and I planted  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:52):**  it and that was it and then he committed to buying whatever I produced.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:10:57):**  Really it was chilled, no contracts or anything like that, it was just a gentleman's agreement  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:02):**  type thing and so it was a really nice way to get into it and so that was three years  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:06):**  ago and the deal is still the same.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:09):**  I grow these Heritage crops, a handful of different varieties now and E5, I'll say  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:14):**  roughly we're planting this amount of acres so roughly I'm probably going to have this  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:17):**  many tonnes and they plan their year of baking and recipes accordingly so it's really super  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:23):**  flexible and it suits me really well and because of no input cost, just a bit of tractor time  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:28):**  planting and harvesting which in the scheme of farm costs they're the small ones.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:35):**  So yeah, the profit per acre comes up and it's sort of a model that looks like it works  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:42):**  so we're trying to do more and more.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:45):**  I've realised it more just as of yesterday and today being here but there's Guy Mark  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:51):**  who spoke yesterday in one of the group discussions and he was saying he considers himself a food  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:11:57):**  producer over a farmer and that was quite interesting and I hadn't really thought about  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:01):**  that to be honest but it feels really good because really the connection with the oil,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:08):**  we farm it, add value to it by making it into oil then we distribute it and so you have  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:14):**  that connection and so we know loads and loads of chefs now to do with the oil and so we  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:17):**  go to the restaurants and they go, oh have a look at this, we've made an ice cream or  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:21):**  something and so that side of it is really fun and to be able to do that again with wheat,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:26):**  I was at E5 and I was there a couple of weeks ago and they were sort of showcasing some  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:30):**  of the varieties so they had done loaves that are just purely Oland or purely Lisbon and  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:35):**  to sort of see those and everyone standing around going oh wow and you know with far  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:40):**  more knowledgeable people than me and far more developed palates and things but just  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:46):**  hearing everyone sort of really saying all this great stuff about it and you think oh  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:50):**  cool, well everyone's into it so let's keep doing it.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:52):**  So yeah it does feel good and whereas with the alternative conventional farming, you  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:12:58):**  just look at farmers weekly commodity prices and that's about all the engagement you have,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:04):**  no idea where it goes to, whether it's going off to Felixstowe to go straight on a boat,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:10):**  whether it's doing anything in this country, you just don't know, it all care, all you  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:13):**  care about is is it a couple of quid more per tonne than it was last week and yeah it's  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:19):**  fairly, and often it's not, so on the basis that that's the only thing that kind of cheers  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:25):**  you up a bit farming wise and it rarely happens, it's a bit sad so it's nice to not be too  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:30):**  involved or be less involved in that now.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:33):**  Before meeting Ben and going to E5 I didn't see that zero input arable farming could be  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:39):**  profitable or even nearly successful.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:41):**  I mean there's a bit of a sort of, I don't know, like a stigma about whether you can  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:47):**  make money from organic farming or zero input farming or whatever, I mean it's very much  
**[0:13:52-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:52):**  the sort of culture is you've got to get that five tonnes an acre and so no, I mean that's  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:13:59):**  my, I mean I was chatting yesterday to a couple of farmers and there's a thing that Gronomist  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:06):**  and I and we all sort of get excited about or used to and it's this concept of a stale  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:11):**  seed bed which is seen as a really positive thing for arable growing wheat because before  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:17):**  you plant in late September everything you're doing is trying to create a stale seed bed  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:23):**  and it's only when you have a step back and you realise what that means and you think  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:28):**  oh, like, you know it's really bonkers now in hindsight that that was such a thing but  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:33):**  that was something that I was proud of, you know, I'd be like, you know, we've done a  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:37):**  really good job, you know, we've cultivated at the right times, we've sprayed glyphosate  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:40):**  at the right times and we've cultivated again and like, yeah, we've got a perfectly stale  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:43):**  seed bed, perfect for the crop of wheat to go in and yeah, and then having a step back  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:48):**  and then realising what, you know, those two words, you know, what that is, stale seed  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:52):**  bed, you know, it's bonkers really in hindsight but, you know, Prince Charles who has a big  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:14:58):**  organic farm and everyone's like, yeah, fair enough, you know, if you're him you can run  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:02):**  an operation like that or as an old F1 driver, amazing guy with an incredible farm, yeah,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:08):**  sure, if you've got millions and millions of quid then you can do it, I mean, there's  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:12):**  that saying, some sort of saying, if you want to make a small fortune from farming you need  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:17):**  to start with a big one, you know, and so that culture is very much part of, you know,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:21):**  modern arable production so, no, I didn't see it as an achievable at all until I met  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:26):**  Ben.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:27):**  I'm Ben and I'm the owner and I'm a baker and a miller and a farmer at E5 Bakehouse.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:34):**  What we did is we looked at how much that farmer would normally get per acre from his  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:40):**  land, the farmer being Oscar of Duchess Farm and we said, well, you know, I mean, he was  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:48):**  very happy to get, you know, the same or a little bit more than he would have got, you  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:52):**  know, from the conventional wheat he was growing so he would have, you know, been planting  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:15:57):**  on his conventional farm a feed wheat, let's say, and getting about four tons per acre.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:05):**  So with this zero input system that we asked him to do with no sort of fertilizer, chemical  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:12):**  fertilizer or herbicides, fungicides, so on, you know, he obviously cut his costs a lot  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:18):**  but the yield was a lot lower but that was fine for us and he gets a little bit more  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:22):**  than he would have got conventionally and at the moment we're all quite happy with the  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:25):**  situation.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:27):**  Artisan Bakers have been inspired by the likes of the new wave of American artisan bakers  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:36):**  so who work with really high protein flours with a lot of gluten in it.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:42):**  We're kind of having to, you know, learn by ourselves now which is obviously really fortunate  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:48):**  so kind of understand more about how those with more sort of gliadin and sort of different  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:16:54):**  proteins behave and how we as bakers need to handle those doughs to get good results  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:00):**  and that's, you know, one of the things that draws a lot of us to baking is to sort of  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:03):**  the challenge of actually, you know, working with these arguably like weaker flours although  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:09):**  they actually have usually higher protein, the old varieties, like up to 16% quite commonly  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:16):**  than the modern types.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:19):**  So our sort of thing when we first got it, it was quite difficult so we blended it over  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:23):**  the past few years, we've been blending it with stronger modern wheats but we've just,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:29):**  you know, really turned a corner with that and understanding now how to work with them  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:34):**  on their own which means we can draw out a lot more, I mean they're bound with flavour,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:39):**  really nice sort of aroma, very herby and sort of buttery flavours and delicious texture,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:45):**  you know, they work really well and it's just we're stoked to be buying grains from a farm,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:50):**  you know, 20 miles down the road from us in, you know, East London, that's really fun but  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:17:55):**  there's also other grains out there and other farmers and it's really pleasing to get to  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:01):**  know them and be able to sort of expand our network.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:05):**  We're having a go farming as well.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:08):**  As bakers, once we begin to feel empowered and have the opportunity to work with farmers,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:13):**  we feel and our customers feel like, yeah, we are in the part of a food system and we  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:17):**  are actually, you know, the change that we want to see so it's really exciting.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:22):**  I think diversity is a word that comes to mind.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:25):**  There's just been so much homogenisation of varieties and methods of farming, you know,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:31):**  we know that the soil isn't kind of rich and full of hummus and mycorrhizae, we know that  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:37):**  that's probably where we need to be going with sort of much lower input farming and  
**[0:18:41-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:41):**  so one of the solutions to that is older varieties with their deeper roots, more diversity amongst  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:49):**  farms, so not just, you know, a handful of modern wheats available on the marketplace  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:18:55):**  but you know, farmers sowing their own seeds, land races, populations, old varieties from  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:00):**  the archives, you know, as well as new creations and that gives a uniqueness to all manner  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:07):**  of things.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:08):**  It gives us a story to our customers and feels we feel linked to the farms and the soils  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:13):**  that they're growing in and it gives farmers the chance to, I hope, be really proud of  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:18):**  what they're growing and, you know, seeing it in products further down the line, not  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:24):**  just bulk grain going off at, you know, rock bottom price onto the commodity market.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:30):**  It's about having platforms to communicate some of those ideas but obviously just giving  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:34):**  it a go as well.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:38):**  On the Saturday night we all feasted together on an array of baked goods and delicious produce  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:44):**  brought by the many farmers in attendance.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:47):**  We were also serenaded by Nathan Mann of Dead Rat Orchestra.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:19:51):**  Well, part of the kind of promise-ish that I made was I would try and write something  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:04):**  in response.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:05):**  So you may have seen me lurking around in the back of your sessions but one of the interesting  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:08):**  things I heard was not only talking about the positives but also sharing the negatives  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:16):**  and sharing the risks and talking to that, talking about that when you're talking about  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:20):**  the stories, you know, that it seems important to share.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:23):**  You know, because there's no connection with, through the consumption chains, with nature,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:29):**  with what's going on.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:30):**  So if it's a bad harvest or a bad season, you know, that may be reflected in what we're  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:34):**  consuming and the consumers, me, it's good to be aware of that too.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:41):**  And that really chimed with me because as an experimental musician I'm always putting  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:44):**  myself on the edge and I try and induce a sense of camaraderie with the audience but  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:49):**  we're kind of in this together, it might fall apart, probably will, and if it does, well,  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:20:55):**  you know, there's a grain of something that's more important happening anyway.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:00):**  So does anybody know the song or the phrase Bread and Roses?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:06):**  Do you know where it comes from?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:10):**  So I did a bit of digging and I found this song Bread and Roses which comes from, if  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:15):**  you'll forgive me while I call it, it comes from a, it's a political slogan, first point  
**[0:21:19-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:19):**  by Rose Snyderman in the States in 1911 and in her speech there was a line and she said  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:28):**  the worker must have bread but she must also have roses too.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:32):**  And it was picked up as a kind of sign that not only should there be a living wage but  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:37):**  there should be enough money to live dignified as well and to feel good about yourself and  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:42):**  so the roses came to symbolise, you know, not just the basics but, and I thought that  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:48):**  I would adopt that because it seems quite a nice way to reflect the community values  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:53):**  and all the other added value that you were all talking about beyond, you know, the grain  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:21:58):**  or the bread and so I've attempted to rewrite, except for the first verse which I've kept  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:05):**  the same because it's so apt, Bread and Roses.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:12):**  As we go marching, marching in the beauty of the day,

**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:27):**  A touch with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:34):**  For the people hear us singing bread and roses, bread and roses.

**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:50):**  We must share our stories for our stories give us power,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:22:57):**  Through stories we're connected to our food bodies and land,

**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:23:44):**  Dark markets have transformed our foods into commodities,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:23:51):**  Our farmers all anonymous and the mills mere factories,

**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:24:28):**  Our cries go ringing through the streets that ancient called for bread,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:24:35):**  Small art, small food, small beauty from our hearts and lands all grew,

**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:23):**  The Student Eats program supports students in setting up food enterprises  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:27):**  in their university or college.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:29):**  In doing so, they embed sustainable food into student life

**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:36):**  In October this year, the Student Eats conference  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:39):**  hosted by Manchester Metropolitan Uni brought together this community  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:43):**  to talk all things from growing and eating to making and selling.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:47):**  How would you describe your feelings about today?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:50):**  Overwhelmed, because after getting to know these new people,  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:26:55):**  I really want to apply those things to what we have right now.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:00):**  It feels really kind of reaffirming to know that I'm part of a bigger group and movement.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:07):**  It's been really interesting hearing what other people have done,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:10):**  not just from the keynote speakers, which were really interesting at the beginning,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:14):**  but also getting to talk to other people during the day  
**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:17):**  and hearing about their experiences and what kind of things they're doing.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:20):**  Claire and Charmaine from Canterbury Christchurch University  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:23):**  tell us about their project, The Gastro Hub.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:26):**  The Gastro Hub is a little bit different.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:29):**  It's not a shop where we actually have a space where we sell.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:33):**  We actually pop up in communities and around campus  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:36):**  doing experiential community events.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:38):**  But the base of our project is that we're trying to reduce food waste  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:42):**  and bring people together.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:43):**  So we work with surplus fruit and vegetables from farm level.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:46):**  Our ingredients are from farms around Kent.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:51):**  There's a big issue right now of farm level food waste.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:54):**  People think a lot of the food waste comes from the supermarkets onwards,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:27:57):**  but actually there's a lot that doesn't actually leave the farm.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:00):**  So we have a great partnership with Glean in Kent,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:03):**  which is a subsidiary of Feedback Global, the environmental and food charity.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:07):**  What they do simply is send out an army of lovely committed volunteers  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:12):**  and go and glean and rescue beautiful fruit and vegetables  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:15):**  that would have otherwise been wasted.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:17):**  So we are actually now getting more involved in that source.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:20):**  So today myself and a couple of our members, our chefs,  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:23):**  were in an orchard in Kent, Selson Farm,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:26):**  and we were gleaning beautiful varieties of apples,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:29):**  which we'll be using in one of our stew recipes.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:31):**  Well, with my role, I'm working with Charmaine  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:35):**  to become the Marketing and Communications Officer.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:38):**  Through that, what we're doing is we're branching out into partnerships  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:42):**  with local communities, local groups,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:45):**  and more locally with the Student Green Office  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:48):**  within the university to engage more student volunteers  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:52):**  and basically build up an army of willing volunteers  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:56):**  that will come and help us at events,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:28:58):**  build up partnerships, and get more people involved in what we do.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:03):**  I would say you have to have courage,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:05):**  because anyone can have an idea and that's fine,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:08):**  but you need to have that courage to get over your own limiting beliefs.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:12):**  And a big thing, I'm actually a Business Management student,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:15):**  so I've been learning a lot through my degree,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:18):**  and the biggest thing that I would say is you've got to really focus on your marketing as well.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:23):**  People sometimes leave that as the last bit,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:25):**  but the marketing is a big part.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:28):**  And also planning. I'm not always the best.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:31):**  I do loads of things at once, but I've really learnt through this enterprise  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:34):**  that planning is so important.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:36):**  So be courageous, but also keep your head on  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:39):**  and make sure you've planned well and accordingly,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:41):**  and don't be afraid to think far in the vision and run the movie,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:45):**  as one of my lecturers would tell me.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:46):**  Believe in what you're doing, believe in the brand that you're getting across,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:49):**  and if you do that, anything is possible.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:52):**  What I've really learnt and what I'd encourage people to do is don't just make it just about the food,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:29:57):**  make it about people as well, about bringing people together  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:01):**  and make the whole event experiential, especially if you can pay as you feel.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:04):**  I've found that people sometimes feel like they're not paying me enough  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:07):**  because they had all these other stuff with bells going on around the soup or the stew.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:12):**  So I would just say really think outside the box in what you're doing,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:15):**  don't just always make it about the food.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:16):**  How can you bring people together? How can you develop community?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:19):**  Share what you do, because even if you think that you're just going up by little steps,  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:25):**  then whatever you do, share it and get the message out there, because every little helps.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:30):**  It's a real pleasure to hear from students involved in the food system,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:33):**  whether that is growing on campus or supplying food from local farms.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:37):**  And it's also great that student unions are supporting these initiatives around the country.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/40-grain-bread-and-students-helping-to-fix-the-food-system#t=0:30:48):**  This month's show was made by me, I'm Joe Barrett, with Ari Rose and Katie Revel.

**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:10:52):**  And Niall pointed out that it would appear that no-till, which naturally builds soil

**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:04):**  Thanks so much for asking this question. It brings up a very important point and we will

**[0:11:16-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:16):**  better for the soil, is not always a particularly ecological approach when applied in isolation.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:24):**  And there are a number of farmers, most notably in the Americas, who are implementing no-till  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:29):**  agriculture in a rather chemical intensive way that has many other negative side effects.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:35):**  In the UK, when people talk about no-till, they're often really referring to conservation

**[0:11:48-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:48):**  the soil. Secondly, always keep the soil covered, so for example using cover crops. And thirdly,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:11:57):**  build diversity into your system, so whether that's through rotation or companion plantings.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:03):**  I think what Elliot was most likely talking about here is purely no-till agriculture that  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:08):**  is practiced with genetically modified crops plus multiple herbicide applications, and  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:13):**  it's a key part of the agribusiness model. This method of no-till farming is common in  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:19):**  large parts of the United States as well as South America. Farmers buy seeds that have  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:24):**  been genetically modified to be resistant to herbicides. They direct drill those seeds  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:30):**  into the land and then apply those herbicides multiple times throughout the year in order  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:36):**  to extinguish any weeds that might be growing in the crop. The crop is of course unaffected  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:12:41):**  as it's been engineered to resist the toxic effects of the herbicide. However, the whole

**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:13:15):**  working to minimize their chemical inputs and looking to work with the natural world

**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:09):**  Yes, thank you very much Rob. So the Loans for Enlightened Agriculture Programme, which  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:15):**  has been given the acronym LEAP, which I think is quite a nice acronym, has evolved out of

**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:36):**  in community finance. We found that to be very successful so we wanted to take that  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:39):**  to the next stage and I've spent the last couple of years trying to create this new

**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:52):**  about one and a half million pounds for the programme. We're offering affordable social  
**[0:14:58-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:14:58):**  investment loans to eligible enterprises side by side with a grant, but also crucially a  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:07):**  pretty comprehensive mentoring programme of business advice and support which will help

**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:17):**  the main objectives is to try and offer funding that allows organisations to grow to the next  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:24):**  stage. Grant funding is becoming rarer and highly competitive and there's a 99% chance  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:31):**  of failure with grants. So we wanted to offer something that was between a grant but not  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:37):**  commercial finance because a lot of the enterprises that we work with are community based and  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:15:42):**  they don't have any assets or they don't track records so they wouldn't be eligible for commercial

**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:09):**  of enlightened agriculture which the Real Farming Trust has been a proponent of for  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:15):**  some time which is a mix of, based on three key principles, agroecology which I think  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:21):**  we all know about and food sovereignty again which we all know about but also economic  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:26):**  democracy and that's one part of the equation that we're really trying to encourage is that  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:32):**  communities can have control of their own food systems but also a say in the businesses  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:37):**  that operate in their communities either through ownership or membership or some other activities  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:44):**  and voluntary work or whatever. So those are the criteria that we're trying to encourage  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:16:50):**  organisations with those criteria to apply to LEAP. The funding that we're offering is

**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:01):**  start-up and at a sort of early to intermediate stage in their development and looking for  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:08):**  funding for the next stage in their development. Grant funding is always going to be really,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:14):**  really important to our sector especially for start-ups and very early stage organisations  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:19):**  and for research and development. So loan finance probably wouldn't be appropriate for  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:27):**  organisations that are in that very early stage or start-up situation. And once the

**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:37):**  making? So yes we're an impact first programme so we're less concerned about the financial  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:17:44):**  return obviously and we want to deliver a social return, that is our primary objective,

**[0:21:16-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:16):**  a vegetable farmer. Yeah we looked into nature and thought how does nature preserve soil  
**[0:21:25-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:25):**  fertility and we found out that soil in nature is always covered and has always active living  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:35):**  roots which keeps up soil fertility. In deserts we don't have roots and we don't have cover  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:43):**  but we also don't have fertile soils so in farming we often don't have active roots and  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:49):**  don't have soil cover and we wonder why our humus content is lowered or how do you say  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:21:56):**  this is decreasing but if we keep up the principles of nature, always roots, always cover, we  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:05):**  can increase soil fertility.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:08):**  The other point is we as a farm, one year we worked with a stopwatch. So we timed how  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:21):**  long do we take for planting in the mulch, how long is it spreading the mulch, how often  
**[0:22:28-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:28):**  do we have to still do some hand weeding or not. So we know the data of our crops, the  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:39):**  working steps, we have the facts of that and so we can calculate very precisely if this  
**[0:22:47-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:47):**  system is financially also worth, or not worth it but it's paying itself and yes this we  
**[0:22:57-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:22:57):**  need to do as a farm because we cannot just play. I think we can be intensive in production  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:06):**  and intensive in building up soil fertility at the same time. This I think is important  
**[0:23:13-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:13):**  and that's why we need many facts to do that and find a way to keep up soil fertility without  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:22):**  reducing production. I mean in the beginning it was a lot of learning by doing also by  
**[0:23:27-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:27):**  mistake sometimes quite frustrating but we kept on going and I would say the last two  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:39):**  three years we learned that technique has to be very precise, machinery has to be very  
**[0:23:46-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:23:46):**  precise so that the system works, that we can support nature in serving us again. Let's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:00):**  call it like this because I think we need to empower nature in a way but we have to  
**[0:24:09-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:09):**  do a quite scientific and quite precise work in this. It's our part and we need to understand  
**[0:24:18-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:18):**  nature in order to do this empowerment. This was one point. The other point I just mentioned  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:27):**  with the facts we really collected data in order to watch nature precisely, watch us  
**[0:24:34-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:34):**  also precisely. Yes, and another point which was this autumn which I found out that we  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:44):**  have to be consistent in what we are doing. We're building up soil fertility during a  
**[0:24:50-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:50):**  season but then we somehow at the end of the season start from the beginning again, sowing  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:24:58):**  a cover crop before we do a lot of tillage and so on. We destroyed quite a bit of what  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:03):**  we built up during the year so and I saw we have to be consistent in what we are doing  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:09):**  and if we see the nice results which nature provides we cannot stop there. We have to  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:15):**  think ahead. It's a journey, it's not a fixed system. It's a journey which we do together  
**[0:25:21-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:21):**  with nature and I think this couch we have to do, have to have and because we have a  
**[0:25:32-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:32):**  task also towards society as farmers. I think so and now we had a drought, a big drought  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:41):**  this year in Germany and that's part of climate change and here we as farmers are a cause  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:49):**  for the climate change as we part of the society but we also a big part of the solution and  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:25:56):**  this we have to see and act in our responsibility which we as farmers have which is the soil.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:02):**  And then to be honest to say there was a mistake but I learned this and that from this. Not  
**[0:26:09-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:09):**  hiding these mistakes and this sometimes made my knees a little bit shaky or shaky and I'm  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:18):**  as a young farmer inexperienced in a way you know but this openness was really helping  
**[0:26:26-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:26):**  me to come further and preventing others to make the same mistakes as I did. So this were  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:35):**  sometimes shaky moments.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:36):**  Wow, so your experiences with roller crimping because that's something that I have seen  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:42):**  on your website but you didn't pick up on and so you've just stopped that now.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:46):**  We tried many years to plant into roller crimped or rolled cover crops and like three years  
**[0:26:56-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:26:56):**  in a row we had quite some loss there because of mice and stuff like this and we stopped  
**[0:27:04-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:04):**  also because we saw that the system of combining in situ mulch which you cover crop which  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:16):**  you grow at the place where you use it combining with transferred mulch has the best results.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:23):**  It's the most resilient system whatever conditions we have. So for us on our farm this was somehow  
**[0:27:34-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:34):**  was becoming clear that it's going this way and the roller crimping was too, had a too  
**[0:27:45-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:45):**  high risk for us. It's quite an interesting system if you just roll the cover crop plant  
**[0:27:54-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:27:54):**  in harvest but it's this system is quite challenging or also sophisticated because you have to  
**[0:28:03-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:03):**  make many things right so that it works and I think it's hard to make often everything  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:11):**  right and in this system which we have now where we combine these two cover crop with  
**[0:28:17-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:17):**  the transferred mulch we are better off in every year. First step is in autumn prepare  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:25):**  the beds loosen the soil so that you have mechanically nice soil structure in the top  
**[0:28:31-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:31):**  soil. Next step is sowing the cover crop September, October it's a mixture of rye grain, hairy  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:41):**  veg and winter peas. The roots stabilize the soil and so in springtime we don't need to  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:49):**  do any soil cultivation anymore. The cover crop grows and produces a lot of biomass up  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:28:57):**  to 12 tons dry matter per hectare which we use on the spot as mulch. We flamel the cover  
**[0:29:05-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:05):**  crop and add some transferred mulch that can be cover crop, clover grass or grassland which  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:14):**  we mow and cut which we add on this mulch layer which was produced by the cover crop.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:20):**  Like this we have around 7 centimeters high mulch layer in which we transplant with our  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:29):**  machine and by this we don't have any weeds because we don't touch the soil no weed seeds  
**[0:29:37-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:37):**  are germinating. Soil structure is so nice that they can just grow their plants. Next  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:46):**  working step is the harvest. I think it's really interesting the selection of your choice  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:52):**  of cover crops. In England we predominantly use a perennial grass and I noticed that you  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:29:59):**  only use the cereal rye as cereal grass an annual essentially an annual grass and that  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:30:04):**  is that essential to your system for terminating cover crops because that's one thing that  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:30:09):**  we have in the UK is what we need to use the plough because we have to get rid of our cover  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:30:14):**  crop over winter and cover crop and the big thing in my mind is that well let's stop using  
**[0:30:18-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:30:18):**  perennial grasses and then we can get rid of this issue with having to till the soil.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/46-vandana-shiva-loans-or-enlightened-agriculture-and-mulching-systems#t=0:30:26):**  Yes definitely perennial grass or crops we don't use as cover crops because we want to

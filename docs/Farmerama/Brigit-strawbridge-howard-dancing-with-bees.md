### Farmerama  (2019-12-05)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:00:00):**  I have not always loved bees as I do now.  Even when I was a child, it was butterflies, baby birds, frog spawn, snails and newts that  most grabbed my attention.  Never bees, apart from bumblebees, that is, which I loved from an early age for their  bumbliness and the humming, buzzing sounds they made.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:00:22):**  It wasn't until many decades later, whilst I was running an environment...  You know, if you put the books down and just sit yourself, you take the time to sit yourself  and just be with the bees or the flowers or whatever.  You may not understand why bees are doing what they're doing, but you learn.  I've learned so much more by watching the bees.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:00:46):**  This is one of the things I wanted to try and get across in my book.  It's only after I started to research and spend more time with bees that I realised  that actually what I needed or wanted to write about was how bees have affected me and what  I've learnt through bees rather than what I've learned about bees.  Hello and welcome to this special interview with bee advocate, wildlife gardener and naturalist  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:01:14):**  Bridget Strawbridge-Howard.  This episode is part of our Women of the Land series with Chelsea Green Publishing, in which  we feature women who are fuelled by their connection with the land to build businesses,  garner movement and share their stories.  They're standing up for what they know works and crafting a better future for us all.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:01:40):**  They've kind of opened up this whole new window back to the kind of wonder and awe that I  remember or we all remember as children.  I just can't walk even a few paces.  You know, if I see something move and it might be a bee or another insect, I just want to  see everything now.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:02:01):**  The book for me, the book that I've written, has kind of written itself and I've let it  go where it will and it's taken me into the world of plants and all the other insects  and birds and it's made me see things.  I think I see the bigger picture better now than I would have done if I'd just carried  on focusing on bee decline.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:02:25):**  Bridget's new book, Dancing with Bees, is a love letter to the natural world.  She invites us to roam the slopes and woods of the ancient Melbourne hills where she grew  up, takes us on an epic journey across the Scottish Highlands to find the great yellow  bumblebee and opens the gate to her allotment for us to meet the clever and cunning cuckoo  bumblebee.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:02:46):**  Since the Second World War we've lost 98% of our wildflower-rich grasslands in the  UK, mainly due to changes in the landscape from intensive farming.  At the same time, we've seen devastating declines in wildflower-loving species of  ground-nesting birds, butterflies and bees.  Some of these are honeybees, but an incredible 96% of all our bee species are solitary bees  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:03:13):**  and we've been fascinated to get to know these lesser-known pollinators and their  importance in a healthy and diverse farming system.  In this interview we learn more about the wonderfully rich and complex world of bees  and delve into the many ways we as farmers can support pollinators by encouraging a diversity  of crops and foliage.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:03:41):**  One of the things that really shocked me in your book Dancing with Bees was that I was  really surprised to learn that there are at least 20,000 different species of bees and  perhaps even more surprised that only nine of those are honeybees.  That surprises most people actually.  I was stunned when I realised that because people know honeybees, they know honeybees  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:04:04):**  exist because of honey very often and people are aware I think of bumblebees and it's just  an eye-opener when you realise how many bees there are and I think of those about 250 are  bumblebees.  I had never even heard of solitary bees.  Really?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:04:23):**  God, but you're not the only one.  This is one of my aims in what I do and something that's become my overriding mission has been  to make people aware that it is not all about honeybees.  In fact, I had someone visit our garden, we sell plants outside the house and people knock  on the door and if they want to know a little bit more I sometimes take them into the garden  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:04:47):**  and a very, very intelligent, well-educated gardener, a young woman, came into the garden  last week and I showed her a particular plant, I think it was purple loosestripe or something  and there were bumblebees and honeybees on it and she said, wow, is that bee pointing  to the honeybee, is that a baby one of that one pointing to the bumblebee?  So that makes me realise how very little we collectively know about the world of bees.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:05:19):**  And that's one of the things I really love in the book is the way you really bring bees  to life, even just thinking that bees have tongues.  Yes, I know!  And they're called, I've always been confused as to whether they are proboscis or proboscis  or probosic, I don't know what the plural is, proboscis or tongues, but I think they  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:05:36):**  are called tongues and they don't act like straws as such, the honeybee's tongue, they  kind of saturate and absorb the nectar from plants and now, I hope I can get this right,  so the length of tongues of bees in the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Ireland for instance,  vary between about 5mm to 15mm and just to put this in perspective, honeybee tongues  are about 6.3mm, so they're relatively small, whereas some of our bumblebees have tongues,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:06:13):**  a few of our bumblebees that are so long that they're about the same length as the bumblebee's  body, so this means you've got different bees, you start to think, ah, that's interesting,  so different flowers are suitable for different lengthed tongues or different sized bees,  the tiniest bee that we have just outside our front door at the moment on our hair bells,  so it's something called a campanula bee, it's a solitary bee and it's way smaller than  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:06:44):**  a grain of rice, lovely, yeah, and it's black and you just would think it's a small flying  insect of some sort if you even registered it and it is the bee that you will see in  Pretty Little Blue hair bells and all the larger campanula and if you compare that to  a huge queen bumblebee, it's difficult to believe that they are all bees, the colours  vary, there's this little black one and there's, I mean everybody knows the black and yellow  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:07:20):**  and white striped bumblebees but bumblebees come in many different colours as well and  then in the tropics, so I've never seen them but I've seen photographs and videos, we've  got orchid bees and sweat bees and they are like jewels, they're like faberg√© jewels  and they come in all the colours of the rainbow and some of them are metallic, so metallic  ruby red and emerald green bees, this is a vast, vast world and I mean I'm just really  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:07:52):**  at the tip of the iceberg, I'm just running around a bit like a headless chicken trying  to get to know them all and just really thinking do you know what, I'm just going to focus  on the ones in my garden because that's easier.  You know at many points in the book you talk us through different landscapes and ecosystems,  how bees and pollinators are making their home there and I felt, what I got from that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:08:27):**  was like it's not always obvious and there's this whole world that many of us are unaware  of that you've really gone through and discovered and so it'd be amazing, you know like what  are the first steps that we can do to start to reconnect with bees, you know what should  we look out for in our gardens or on the farm, you know, how can we start that journey?  Sometimes when I do talks and it's a daytime talk and there's a garden outside, I take  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:08:55):**  people out on little bee walks, this is where the difference between learning to identify  with a chart which is important but then actually thinking it doesn't matter if you don't get  the right name for the right bee, it's watching them then start listening to them, start listening  to their buzzes and you notice that the big bees make, you know the huge great bequeen  bumblebees have a really deep buzz and some of the, so there's a bee called a hairy footed  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:09:27):**  flower bee, hairy footed flower bee is another of my favourites and it's got a really high  buzz, sort of high buzz, buzz and so if you notice different buzzes and then notice that  with plants like poppies, if you have poppies or open cup shaped plants, you might have  a big bumblebee flying in with its deep buzz but when it gets to the poppy, the buzz changes  to a high pitched like a dentist drill sound and so you think wow, there's a change in  
**[0:10:00-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:10:00):**  the sound, why is that, what's happening and actually that's buzz pollination there or  buzz foraging there, they're disconnecting their wings inside their bodies and buzzing,  buzzing, buzzing so they're vibrating the wing muscles, the flight muscles inside the bodies  but without flapping the wings and that's how they release the pollen from that plant.  So there's all these things that I've learnt because I've watched and seen and then you'll  
**[0:10:31-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:10:31):**  notice things like bees that are asleep in the flower at the end of the day and they  haven't gone back to their home and they're male bumblebees because they're not allowed  back in once they leave the nest so you think oh, there are bees that sleep inside flowers.  It really is just going out and making the time to sit and we don't do that, we're just  rushing around too much, we're too busy all of us and if you make the time to sit and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:11:10):**  for me firstly you learn more about bees but then of course the other thing is it's almost  meditative and you forget everything, you forget all the things that were bothering  you when you left the house, I mean I sometimes actually forget that I've got something boiling  on the cooker, it's just stepping inside the bees world, leaving your own world behind  and allowing some kind of a connection, of course they're not connecting with you but  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:11:41):**  you can connect with them.  And I wonder on a farm level, at a farm scale, if you were to design a bee friendly farm,  what might that look like, could you describe what it might look like?  If I were to inherit a smallholding tomorrow, I would plant fruit trees galore, I would  plant so many apples, I would fill the hedgerows with flowering with hawthorn, blackthorn,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:12:14):**  I would look at larger on a landscape scale for trees, I would be looking at the flowering  trees, so horse chestnut is a good one, so starting outwards I guess I'd look at trees  coming down to hedgerows, I'd be looking at, if I was wanting to use a green manure, I  would be looking, all of the clovers are fantastic, clovers, all of the clovers, vetches, alfalfas  and forcelia, because we do this on our allotments so I'm thinking you'd probably scale up on  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:12:48):**  a farm scale what we have on our allotment and whenever we have a patch that we're just  going to leave with nothing in it for a while, we fill it with fusilia and fusilia is a plant  that flowers between, wow, between about May and October and it's an absolute magnet, not  just for bees, we're talking about bees here but of course it's about more than bees as  well, not just honey bees, not just the 20,000 bee species but all pollinators and all insects,  
**[0:13:15-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:13:15):**  so fusilia is a magnet for beneficial insects as well as being a green manure itself. So  yeah I'd be looking at a macro and micro, I'd be looking at the ground cover and shrubs  and trees and hedgerows, I'd be looking at it all and I'd be looking to have a variety  of different types of blooms, thinking okay we need all this diversity of all these different  bees so different shaped blooms so trumpets and bowls and bells and then the flatheads,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:13:56):**  not forgetting all the carrot family, they're really great for hoverflies and all the short  tongued bees. So yeah and a succession and on a farm level you would be planting things  in clumps, if you have a very small garden for instance people often, it's a mistake  to put a poppy here and a poppy there and then a sunflower here and a sunflower there,  if you clump your flowers of the same species together then there's less energy for the  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:14:27):**  bee that is out foraging on sunflowers if it can go to all the sunflowers in one go  rather than having to use its precious energy to fly to another part of the garden and that's  kind of what you do on a farm scale wouldn't you anyway.  Honey bees and bumble bees are social bees so they live in colonies, they communicate,  they cooperate, they have overlapping generations and kind of a caste system so they'd have  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:15:14):**  a queen and workers or females and males that really only exist to mate and when the queen  lays eggs she is still alive when the eggs hatch so there are overlapping generations  so that's the social bees in a nutshell but the solitary bees they come in varying degrees  of solitary and sociality it's quite complex but if you think of them as a single mum that's  the best way to think of them, say if I take one particular type of solitary bee the ashy  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:15:47):**  mining bee which is really easy to identify it makes its nest in the ground and so each  single adult female once she's mated digs her own little burrow into the ground and  she provisions each little compartment she makes little compartments and she provisions  each compartment herself with a little bit of pollen and then she lays an egg and seals  it and she'll do that I don't know say between 10, 20, 30 times and then she dies she that's  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:16:21):**  her life ended so she's alive for about six weeks maybe between six and eight weeks and  that is so that's a true solitary bee she doesn't interact or cooperate with any of  the other bees around her there may be lots of other ashy mining bees making their nests  all around her in the same little patch of soil she is independent of them and the only  interaction she has with any others of her particular species is with the males when  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:16:53):**  she mates with them so it really is like being a single mother.  If you went out into your garden today and you were looking for solitary bee I mean is  the best place to look near the soil or?  In the soil and in the grass you'd look for little tiny little holes or little miniature  mole hills that would like excavations and you think oh there's something's digging  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:17:17):**  there and you probably would think it's an ant but actually it could be a solitary bee  but far far easier is have you heard of bee hotels they're very often drilled holes in  pieces of wood which are not so great but that's a whole other issue which we may may  be able to talk about later but bamboo tubes so if you've got lots and lots of empty tubes  of bamboo and say they're about oh six inches long and they're gathered together in a bundle  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:17:47):**  or they're inside a tube of some sort and those sort of empty tubes will attract mason  bees and leaf cutter bees and just outside our front door we've got a bee hotel and leaf  cutters are using it at the moment and I watched them for hours very very close up because  they're not dangerous these solitary bees most of them don't have a sting the ones that  do really don't use them they honestly you'd have to be really a manhandle it to to to  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:18:20):**  cause it to sting you so I watched them so so you've got a tube and the first you know  that something's going on is you see a bee flying in and out of the tube and you think  whoa there's a bee going in and out of the tube and it's carrying a piece of leaf underneath  it a rolled up piece of leaf and then they'll go and get some more leaves and they'll  line a little bit more pollen another egg block it off and then make another cell and  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:18:44):**  then they come to the very very end of the the tube and they collect maybe 20 little  pieces of perfectly cut circles of leaf to block the end off so that's how you see them  those are the most visible they are very highly visible solitary bees and anyone who puts  up a bee hotel you know use using bamboo tubes or lots of people you can use cardboard tubes  as well carefully made cardboard tubes that are lined with paper and if you put them in  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:19:15):**  kind of south-facing positions or west or east-facing positions you will see these bees  and then you can watch the whole life cycle play out and it's fascinating I remember in  your book you described the red-tailed mason bee as your favorite bee in the world oh yeah  that's that is so everything I've just described the red-tailed mason bee and her her sort  of scientific name is osmere bicolor and she does all of that but she does it inside snail  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:19:46):**  shells so you know you see these abandoned snail shells lying around your garden and  if you're if you're growing the right plants and you're in the right area they may just  be reused by the red-tailed mason bee who does exactly the same she puts a bit of pollen  in it lays an egg blocks it off and then I say it in the book why she's my favorite because  she just does so much more you know so the ones in the bee hotels stick a load of leaves  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:20:18):**  at the edge or a load of mud but she turns the so she fills the snail shell with little  bits of oh gravel or pebbles or shells or or little bits of debris and then she collects  more leaves and she chews them up and she makes like a pesto and spits lots of bit of  pesto inside the the shell so she fills it up with a plug of pesto then she turns it  upside down so the entrance is facing the ground covers it with a bit more pesto and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:20:50):**  then the reason she's my favorite bee on the planet is she then goes and she collects about  up to about a hundred pieces of dried grass that are maybe three four times the length  of her body and she flies back and forth of these pieces of dried grass and she thatches  the shell she's often called the the snail thatching bee and she basically is covering  the shell in little pieces of dried grass and nobody knows exactly why she does this  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:21:22):**  except it kind of sounds to us to humans it sounds pretty obvious that she's maybe camouflaging  it disguising it so nobody will see it but we know from from watching this that the grass  blows away a few days later so it doesn't stay there but but this is this is just one  bee this is one little bee doing all that work um you know and oh we take it so much  for granted and these by the way none of these solitary bees make honey so it's only honey  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:21:55):**  bees that make honey and these solitary bees don't store honey and if you think there's  20,000 different bees and they all have different ways of doing this it's mind-boggling just  mind-boggling  At the start of the book you talk quite a bit about colony collapse disorder and how  that was one of the reasons you became interested to understand more about bees and I was particularly  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:22:30):**  intrigued to hear that I just love this idea that bees ferment the pollen before eating  it and some of the links to fungicide use and how that could potentially affect this  so  So we know that the bees collect nectar to make honey they collect pollen to feed their  young and the thing with the pollen is that it can't be fed to the bees in its raw state  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:22:54):**  to the to the um the larvae in its raw state it needs to be fermented um to make it palatable  and digestible and one of the most important ingredients apart from enzymes that the bee  produces um herself the adult bee the females produce themselves is that the natural wild  yeasts so you think okay that's that's all great you understand that but then you start  thinking well what about um fungicides that are used we know that um insecticides um are  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:23:25):**  dangerous and herbicides um you know take out lots of the plants they feed on but not  many people have made the link between um the need for bees to use natural yeasts to  ferment the pollen and the use of fungicides and it seems so obvious to me that if there  are fungicides in the area and if the bees are going to bring fungicides into their hive  we're talking honeybees here then they are going to be interrupting the natural process  
**[0:23:56-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:23:56):**  um by which they need to ferment their pollen um by destroying perhaps the natural yeasts  that are round inside the hive you know i i work a little bit in winemaking um on my  family's farm and that has uh relevant links in terms of in the vineyard industry um you  certainly it's very difficult to make a natural wine if you've been using fungicides in the  vineyard because there aren't enough natural yeasts around to really cause the fermentation  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:24:25):**  of the wine in the same way and i'll tell you the person who um because i had a conversation  with um a friend of mine phil chandler and phil chandler um is a natural beekeeper he's  the person who has more or less pioneered the concept of natural beekeeping certainly  in in great britain and ireland he was he's the one who told me about this link between  the fungicides and the um the breaking down the fermenting of pollen uh and it's very

**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:26:10):**  you it show you its sting um and this is it warning you it's it's saying um i've got a  sting i am capable of stinging you i will sting you uh but i now know that bees only  do this if they haven't got the energy to fly off so their first choice would be to  fly away you know they don't want to hang around if we get too close but if they haven't  had enough nectar or it's too cold they can't fly they're just politely saying that you're  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees#t=0:26:36):**  getting too close you're making me a bit nervous i could sting you i see videos on the internet's  ridiculous on youtube where every now and then the same video flies around again and  people think people say hey look you know there's a bee it's it's high fiving me and  it's so not high fiving you um but but that's that's what people think they're doing they're  sticking up their their little leg to high five you

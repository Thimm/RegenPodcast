**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:00):**  Cooking with whole grains and grinding our own grains, we just bought our first little  
**[0:00:13-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:13):**  grain mill and Dan gave me a bag of dried corn and it was Otofile, agroflint corn, that  
**[0:00:23-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:23):**  Glenn from Anson Mills had sent some seed up to Jack and Jack had grown the stuff out  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:32):**  and had dried this corn and Dan said like I want you to make palenta and cook with this  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:38):**  and I was like what the hell.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:39):**  In fact though we didn't even have a grinder, I remember, we didn't have a grinder.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:43):**  I'm like grind this corn and cook it like palenta.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:47):**  These big fat sort of golden to sort of reddish dry corn kernels, not like popcorn kernels,  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:54):**  these are big corn.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:55):**  I was like well firstly how am I going to grind this because I've never ground my own  
**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:00):**  corn before.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:01):**  So I threw it into a Vitamix, into a blender and it made a hell of a noise.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:06):**  I got something that sort of closely resembled cornmeal palenta and I cooked it in the way  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:12):**  we cook palenta here in sort of a double boiler and I just cooked it with water and  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:16):**  some salt and pepper, I think just some salt.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:18):**  But I noticed it was taking a long time to cook so I was just like this is definitely  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:22):**  not like the boxed palenta that I've worked with before and you know just kept on adding  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:27):**  more and more water and I tasted this and I remember coming down to Dan, it was truly  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:34):**  it was like a holy shit moment of cooking for me.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:37):**  It had this incredible like glossy sheen to it, almost like it was like I'd added a lot  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:41):**  of butter to it but it wasn't, I hadn't added butter to it because Dan just used water and  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:45):**  a little bit of salt, I just wanted to see what it tastes like.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:49):**  And I tasted it and I had this realization and it was incredibly, I felt kind of dumb,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:56):**  where I was like hold on a second, palenta is corn.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:02):**  Like I'd never made that connection.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:05):**  Palenta was palenta.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:07):**  Palenta was this like yellowy, parogy stuff that tasted really good with brie short ribs  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:13):**  or with like a lamb ragu or with tons of cheese and herbs put into it.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:19):**  But I was never like, I never ate palenta and be like oh this is corn.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:23):**  The stuff that I tasted, I suppose it had a lot more texture than the palenta I'd ever  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:31):**  cooked before and I'd cooked a lot of palenta in my career and it tasted like sweet summer  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:36):**  corn, maybe without the intense sugar you know of sweet summer corn but it just had  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:41):**  that like really, for lack of a better word, corny kind of a flavor.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:47):**  And a flavor that I would never associate with eating palenta.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:50):**  And it's the last thing I would think of when I eat palenta is that I'm eating corn.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:54):**  That to me, that sort of started us, well for me personally it was like okay maybe there's  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:58):**  some credibility to this whole like grinding fresh and using the whole grain.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:02):**  That sort of oily sheen that I was noticing was because it still had the endosperm in  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:08):**  there.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:09):**  It was like alive and you had all those oils, the kind of stuff that would be removed to  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:15):**  extend the shelf life of most commercially produced palenta, even good quality commercially  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:20):**  produced palenta.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:21):**  You know, you cook for a long time and you cook in a great place and you know you always  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:26):**  get sent like great olive oil or like you gotta try this balsamic vinegar or you gotta  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:30):**  try this caviar or you gotta try you know whatever it is and there's a lot of great  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:33):**  product out there.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:34):**  And I feel like sometimes you start to split hairs between some of these like they're all  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:38):**  good.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:39):**  This was one of those things I was like okay not all palentas are graded equal and that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:44):**  there truly is something to be said for you know the breeding, the growing practices,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:52):**  the grinding fresh, the cooking it immediately that was like okay maybe this whole grinding  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:58):**  on grains thing that Dan is like seems really into like this is there's some credibility  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:04:04):**  to this and it translates to great flavor, it translates to great nutrition, all this  
**[0:04:08-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:04:08):**  stuff but with the flavor it was just like wow okay this is the real deal.

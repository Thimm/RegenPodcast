**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:00):**  Cooking with whole grains and grinding our own grains, we just bought our first little  grain mill and Dan gave me a bag of dried corn and it was Otofile, agroflint corn, that  Glenn from Anson Mills had sent some seed up to Jack and Jack had grown the stuff out  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:32):**  and had dried this corn and Dan said like I want you to make palenta and cook with this  and I was like what the hell.  In fact though we didn't even have a grinder, I remember, we didn't have a grinder.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:43):**  I'm like grind this corn and cook it like palenta.  These big fat sort of golden to sort of reddish dry corn kernels, not like popcorn kernels,  these are big corn.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:00:55):**  I was like well firstly how am I going to grind this because I've never ground my own  corn before.  So I threw it into a Vitamix, into a blender and it made a hell of a noise.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:06):**  I got something that sort of closely resembled cornmeal palenta and I cooked it in the way  we cook palenta here in sort of a double boiler and I just cooked it with water and  some salt and pepper, I think just some salt.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:18):**  But I noticed it was taking a long time to cook so I was just like this is definitely  not like the boxed palenta that I've worked with before and you know just kept on adding  more and more water and I tasted this and I remember coming down to Dan, it was truly  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:34):**  it was like a holy shit moment of cooking for me.  It had this incredible like glossy sheen to it, almost like it was like I'd added a lot  of butter to it but it wasn't, I hadn't added butter to it because Dan just used water and  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:01:45):**  a little bit of salt, I just wanted to see what it tastes like.  And I tasted it and I had this realization and it was incredibly, I felt kind of dumb,  where I was like hold on a second, palenta is corn.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:02):**  Like I'd never made that connection.  Palenta was palenta.  Palenta was this like yellowy, parogy stuff that tasted really good with brie short ribs  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:13):**  or with like a lamb ragu or with tons of cheese and herbs put into it.  But I was never like, I never ate palenta and be like oh this is corn.  The stuff that I tasted, I suppose it had a lot more texture than the palenta I'd ever  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:31):**  cooked before and I'd cooked a lot of palenta in my career and it tasted like sweet summer  corn, maybe without the intense sugar you know of sweet summer corn but it just had  that like really, for lack of a better word, corny kind of a flavor.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:47):**  And a flavor that I would never associate with eating palenta.  And it's the last thing I would think of when I eat palenta is that I'm eating corn.  That to me, that sort of started us, well for me personally it was like okay maybe there's  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:02:58):**  some credibility to this whole like grinding fresh and using the whole grain.  That sort of oily sheen that I was noticing was because it still had the endosperm in  there.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:09):**  It was like alive and you had all those oils, the kind of stuff that would be removed to  extend the shelf life of most commercially produced palenta, even good quality commercially  produced palenta.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:21):**  You know, you cook for a long time and you cook in a great place and you know you always  get sent like great olive oil or like you gotta try this balsamic vinegar or you gotta  try this caviar or you gotta try you know whatever it is and there's a lot of great  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:33):**  product out there.  And I feel like sometimes you start to split hairs between some of these like they're all  good.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:39):**  This was one of those things I was like okay not all palentas are graded equal and that  there truly is something to be said for you know the breeding, the growing practices,  the grinding fresh, the cooking it immediately that was like okay maybe this whole grinding  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-adam-kaye-on-polenta#t=0:03:58):**  on grains thing that Dan is like seems really into like this is there's some credibility  to this and it translates to great flavor, it translates to great nutrition, all this  stuff but with the flavor it was just like wow okay this is the real deal.

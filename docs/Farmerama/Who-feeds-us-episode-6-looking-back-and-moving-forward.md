**[0:00:00-0:00:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:00):**  Who feeds us?  
**[0:00:03-0:00:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:03):**  Episode 6  
**[0:00:04-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:04):**  Looking back and moving forward  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:11):**  This series is a chorus of voices from people across the British Isles  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:16):**  People on the land and the seas, on allotments and city roofs  
**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:21):**  The stories of farmers, growers, community leaders, healers, chefs, beekeepers, fishers and others  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:28):**  This is who feeds us  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:34):**  So here we are again  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:36):**  Across the UK, we're all living under some kind of lockdown  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:40):**  Last time around, we were on the upswing of the year  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:44):**  The days were getting longer and warmer  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:46):**  And most of us expected the restrictions to last maybe a few weeks  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:50):**  This time, we're heading into winter  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:52):**  And while the supermarket shelves are no longer empty  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:00:56):**  I think it's fair to say the future still feels pretty uncertain and daunting  
**[0:01:04-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:04):**  But over the last five episodes, we've heard a chorus of voices sharing stories of resilience, of hope, of creativity and compassion  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:14):**  These stories are proof that the alternatives to industrial food already exist  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:20):**  And if we believe in them, engage with them and invest in them, they can thrive and become the norm  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:26):**  In this final episode, we'll revisit some of the people we've heard from throughout the series  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:32):**  We'll tease out some of the common threads that bind these apparently disparate voices together  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:38):**  Threads such as reverence, gratitude, sovereignty, dignity and abundance  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:44):**  We'll hear more about what these people have learnt over the course of this year  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:48):**  Their visions for resilient, localised food economies  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:52):**  And how they see the future of who feeds us  
**[0:01:58-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:01:58):**  One of the recurring themes in the stories we've heard is the idea that a healthy, equitable and sustainable food system  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:06):**  Must have respect and reverence at its core  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:10):**  Reverence for the land, for animals, for people and for the food on our plates  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:16):**  And as we heard from Khalil Atan, beekeepers at the East London Mosque, this reverence is central to their business and their faith  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:24):**  Within the Quran, there's actually a chapter which is called The Bee  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:28):**  It talks about bees and the benefit that bees can provide and it talks about honey  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:32):**  It mentions about how honey bees are a source of inspiration  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:36):**  So they're something that you can derive lessons from  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:40):**  And it talks about how within the honey that the bees produce in their bellies, you get some benefit that is derived from that  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:48):**  You know, I have a huge amount of respect for the bees  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:52):**  If I don't take care of the needs of the bees first, I won't be taking any honey off them  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:02:58):**  You know, my colonies, they have to be thriving, they have to be doing really well before I even think about taking any of the extra honey off them  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:06):**  So I think you have to have the respect towards the bees and I think you have to have that understanding towards your livestock  
**[0:03:14-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:14):**  If you don't have that respect towards your livestock and you don't have that care and compassion towards the honey bees  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:23):**  Then I think there's no point in you being a beekeeper to be honest  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:28):**  I think you have to have that understanding of the restrictions that honey bees have  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:35):**  And that there may be times when our colonies might not produce honey and that's fine  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:39):**  You know, some years will be good, some years will be not so good  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:43):**  And you just have to have that understanding of what your honey bees are capable of doing  
**[0:03:50-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:03:50):**  And I think people have this greater respect when they understand that there's a lot more behind that jar of honey than first meets the eye  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:00):**  I think there is a greater respect towards locally produced food  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:06):**  We bring the honey back ourselves, we'll extract it ourselves, we'll jar it ourselves  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:12):**  So from the hive to the jar, we're doing the whole process ourselves  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:18):**  And people know that that's what we're doing and they have some sort of respect for the fact that they know us  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:24):**  And they know that we are doing this ourselves from the bee to the jar and we can talk to them about the whole process as well  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:32):**  People will come to us and they'll ask us certain questions about how we produce the honey, what do we do  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:38):**  Do you feed your honey bees? Do you mix sugar into the honey?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:43):**  Obviously that doesn't happen with local beekeepers  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:46):**  Is it actually you who are the beekeepers? All of these kind of questions  
**[0:04:50-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:50):**  So I think people are becoming more and more, maybe they've had more time to research into these things and they want quality now as well  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:04:58):**  So if they're going to purchase something local, with local normally you get quality as well  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:03):**  So people want to know these kind of things as well, is this what you're actually doing?  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:09):**  So respect is a crucial component of Salman Khalil's localised model of honey production  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:15):**  Respect for the bees, the beekeepers, the customers and the wider community they're all part of  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:21):**  As we heard, farmer and halal slaughterman Mohsen Hassanin shares this focus  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:27):**  His practice is focused on reverence for life and that includes honouring the life of animals in death  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:34):**  So when I approach that animal, especially on farm, on farm I've many times tears have come to my eyes  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:40):**  But I've also understood how important it is what I'm doing  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:43):**  This animal has to be killed in the right way and I'm the right man for the job  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:48):**  What you do is you elevate that animal and you're then elevating yourself and your spirit to deal with that harsh reality of taking life  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:05:58):**  Salma, Khalil and Mohsen are part of a growing movement of producers and eaters  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:03):**  Who are reclaiming reverence and respect as key pillars of a just and sustainable food system  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:10):**  Being respectful or reverent is also about being curious and seeking a better understanding of the people, the land and the systems that bring our food to us  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:20):**  Here are chef Skye Gingell and biodynamic farmer Jane Scotter  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:25):**  People used to sit down to a meal and they would say grace and have gratitude for the food on their table  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:31):**  Like it was a really important big thing and they understood that it was a valuable commodity  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:38):**  And I think people would spend a lot more money on food certainly right up until the 1950s when food changed beyond all recognition  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:46):**  And we had fast food and we could develop food with fertilizers and sprays  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:06:54):**  And we could feed people en masse cheaply which was incredible  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:00):**  But also it kind of really devalued food  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:04):**  And so we don't really have any gratitude around it anymore  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:08):**  And we have the only question I believe we all need to ask ourselves is where does my food come from and how is it grown  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:15):**  And that's the one question that we don't really ask  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:18):**  So as consumers or eaters what does it look like for us to have reverence and respect for the food on our plates  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:26):**  And for the people, the plants, the animals and the soil that have brought that food to us  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:31):**  Could expressing gratitude, giving thanks in whatever way feels right to each of us  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:37):**  Could that be a simple first step in building a healthier more resilient relationship with those who feed us  
**[0:07:44-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:44):**  Experiencing that sense of gratitude requires and encourages an appreciation of the complexity of the natural systems that food producers work with  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:54):**  And the huge amount of thought and effort that's gone into every bite of food  
**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:07:59):**  Jane and Skye's newest collaboration is a restaurant and biodynamic farm in the grounds of Heckfield Place Hotel in Hampshire  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:07):**  One of their colleagues at the hotel had a life changing experience during lockdown that speaks to this idea  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:13):**  A fellow called Peter who is the food beverage manager, he was a chef as well by trade  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:20):**  And because there was no head gardener at the time when the pandemic came around or lockdown started  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:28):**  He had to go down and manage everything and had never really done any gardening before in his life  
**[0:08:34-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:34):**  And I think he fell in love with it and he loves Heckfield, he's very devoted to the place  
**[0:08:44-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:44):**  And he learnt really quickly and it just really, you know all the things, it's a bit like you hear yourself telling your children  
**[0:08:53-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:08:53):**  And then suddenly it's coming back at you and you knew that we had sort of broken through this barrier to the management really  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:01):**  Of the understanding of what it is down there, what it takes to grow all this stuff  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:06):**  He walks around with a knife attached to his kind of like belt, he's like, he's a holster yeah  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:13):**  He's like, he's amazing and it's also really understanding, you know like I think it gets back to what I said at the beginning  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:21):**  Which was really the biggest learning curve to me was to really understand the value of growing and food  
**[0:09:29-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:29):**  And that we all have gotten very used to food being incredibly cheap and available whenever we want it  
**[0:09:38-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:38):**  And actually to grow food is, even just to grow the simplest thing is to get that bunch of, like to get those tomatoes at this time of year  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:49):**  I mean all the work that's gone into it six, eight, nine months before, you know like whether it's prepping the soil  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:09:56):**  Or like plant propagating the seed, growing it, weeding, watering it, you know  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:02):**  And I think it's like, I think he's just developed this incredibly deep understanding of the fickleness  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:10):**  Apart from anything of nature and then the human toil that goes into and also the abundance  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:17):**  You know Jane touched on that before, it's like in a really small space if it's really biodiverse and the soil is incredibly healthy and nutrient dense  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:27):**  I mean it literally pops up a bit like Jack and the Bean, you know that you can grow so much in such a little space  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:34):**  And I think he's just like, he's made the connection, you know between, with the earth I think and the soil  
**[0:10:42-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:42):**  And I think a lot of chefs have a huge disconnect, one thing I do think is like, and the thing that I'm most proud of  
**[0:10:52-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:10:52):**  Like in my work I think is I really do definitely put my money where my mouth is, you know like you hear a lot of people about talking about hypersus- seasonal  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:02):**  You know like you wouldn't meet a chef that didn't say, if you said how do you cook and they'd go, oh seasonally and sustainably  
**[0:11:09-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:09):**  But you know they have no idea if that involves a mango on their dish, there's a lot of green washing and virtue signaling out there  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:17):**  And I really think what we do is the real deal and I feel incredibly proud of that  
**[0:11:22-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:22):**  And I think the thing that was so lovely for us is, you know we love Peter and he's like an amazing, we're like the three legged stool together  
**[0:11:32-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:32):**  You know like, but he's really made that huge connection with just what it takes to grow food  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:42):**  Which will, yes and which has taken the whole farm forward in so many ways  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah to a whole different level  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:50):**  Yeah so we're very happy about that  
**[0:11:54-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:11:54):**  We definitely need many more small organic, biodynamic farms and we need biodiversity and we absolutely need it  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:06):**  It's essential to you know, to our health, to the health you know, I mean our health and the health of the planet is one and the same  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:14):**  It's not separated and it's really, really I feel all the time what we're doing whether we make any difference or not  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:21):**  Our work is really important  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:24):**  We're just making a contribution that's what you're right  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:27):**  Yeah we're living in the solution  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:29):**  Yeah  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:32):**  Another theme that came up again and again is the resilience that comes from working on a small scale  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:38):**  Or maybe more accurately a human scale  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:41):**  A scale at which it's possible to build genuine, personal relationships with colleagues, suppliers, customers and communities  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:49):**  Skye and Jane along with Scotland based farmer and restaurateur Angus Buchanan-Smith  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:12:54):**  Have found that building localised, human scale infrastructures and cultivating close relationships between their farms and restaurants  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:02):**  Has allowed them to quickly and nimbly respond to the crisis  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:06):**  When it comes to imagining a truly resilient food system, this responsiveness is key  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:11):**  After all, farming is inherently unpredictable  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:15):**  Dean at Ballylisk Dairies told us that farming is a gamble every day  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:20):**  Every year is different  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:22):**  So the ways in which we produce our food need to be flexible enough to respond to everything the world throws at us  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:28):**  And that includes economic instability, an unpredictable climate and public health crises like the one we're living through right now  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:36):**  But farmers and other food producers can't be responsive like this without some level of stability and security  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:43):**  One approach is for us, the eaters, to share the risks with the farmer by paying for a regular supply of produce in advance through a subscription model  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:53):**  Here's Angus Buchanan-Smith  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:13:59):**  So we started farming pigs here about five years ago  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:04):**  And initially actually the first pig was bought for a present from my dad for his birthday  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:10):**  We always knew he always loved pigs and we thought it would be quite a nice present  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:15):**  And it slowly grew and we actually, at the beginning, we primarily focused on barkshires  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:22):**  And we wanted a farm in a way that was as natural as possible  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:26):**  So they're outside in fields for as much of the year as we possibly can keep them outside  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:31):**  And the beauty of a barkshire is that as long as they're given good grass, they will actually graze  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:38):**  And pigs get a bad rep for digging up the ground  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:41):**  But if you're able to actually rotate them across good fields, they prefer to eat the sweeter grass than dig for the roots  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:49):**  So we did this and we slowly upscaled it  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:52):**  And initially we started putting the pigs through the restaurants  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:14:57):**  But when we got a few more, we thought, actually, maybe there's a really nice market to be able to sell some of this pork  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:02):**  As we began to have a bit of a surplus, we thought, why not set up a way for customers to buy directly from us?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:09):**  So we created the Pig Club and this is basically a subscription model  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:13):**  And it allows our customers to sign up for ideally for a year  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:18):**  And there's two options, either a whole member or a half member  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:21):**  And the idea is after 12 months of being part of the Pig Club  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:26):**  You've received every single cut to make up either half a pig or a whole pig  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:31):**  There's so many of the unusual cuts that they just don't get to the conventional supermarkets  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:35):**  And people are therefore unaware of how to cook them or how to utilise them when we get them  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:41):**  So we also make an effort to include little recipe cards to allow our customers to basically access some of the more  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:50):**  Yeah, some of these more unique cuts and not be too afraid of them  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:53):**  And know how to prepare a ham hock or what best way to cook a jowl or whatever  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:15:59):**  It's kind of just gone from strength to strength and it's now particularly for this last year  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:04):**  Has been a vital lifeline that has kept the entire operation afloat  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:09):**  This was something that we ran alongside the restaurants  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:12):**  But since the restaurant closed through a lockdown, it's been a really important lifeline for us  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:17):**  That along with the Veg Club  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:19):**  Similar to the Pig Club in many respects, it's also a subscription model  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:22):**  Basically, and we've got different options  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:24):**  We've got weekly members, fortnightly members and monthly members  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:28):**  Basically all the veg that's harvested from the farm is distributed  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:32):**  It's put into these boxes and then distributed throughout Edinburgh  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:36):**  It's a really good way to give us security because obviously  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:40):**  Although we also sell wholesale and obviously food goes to the restaurants  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:44):**  There are always gluts of certain items throughout the year  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:48):**  And as a small scale market gardener, you can never predict what's going to be really good  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:54):**  Or what you suddenly get a sunny spell and all your gadgets come on at once  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:16:58):**  It's just a really nice way to give us a little bit more security and reduce our waste  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:03):**  But also giving our veg customers the pick of the crop  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:08):**  They basically get some really exciting fresh produce picked the day before it gets to them  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:15):**  Which is, you can't really beat that  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:17):**  What we've managed to do with the Veg Club and the Pig Club is  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:21):**  To create the most direct route to market and selling directly to our customers  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:27):**  And if you have these subscribed members on board  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:30):**  You know that consistently every month you can predict your sales  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:33):**  And that's been, from being able to reduce our risks  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:37):**  That's been hugely beneficial and allowed us to lay out a growing plan for the year  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:43):**  Based on X amount of members of the club  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:47):**  Which has been a really helpful way to reduce waste and reduce risks  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:17:54):**  Through the Pig Club and the Veg Club, Angus has used a subscription model to build resilience into his business  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:01):**  It allows him to plan more effectively, to reduce waste and to reduce risk  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:06):**  It also gives him the financial security and the peace of mind  
**[0:18:10-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:10):**  To be able to focus on creating a holistic system in which all the elements, such as the vegetables and the pigs, support each other  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:19):**  In a similar way, bakers Rosie Benson and Rosie Gray offer bread subscriptions  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:24):**  And these provide enough security to allow them to experiment and to be responsive to the changing situation  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:30):**  For example, by baking extra loaves for food banks  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:34):**  We also heard from Dee Woods of Granville Community Kitchen, based in the London neighbourhood of South Kilburn  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:41):**  Dee has built another form of subscription service, a community supported agriculture scheme  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:46):**  Which includes an option known as Solidarity Shares  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:50):**  Those who can afford to pay a bit extra subsidise other people's subscriptions  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:18:54):**  Allowing them to access high quality, locally grown vegetables for the price of a healthy start voucher  
**[0:19:01-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:01):**  The industrialised food system, it's either that cheap food fills people up, is killing us  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:12):**  It's killing us, it's killing our planet, it's killing the environment, it's making us sick  
**[0:19:18-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:18):**  That can't continue, it just isn't acceptable that we are oppressing people so that we can have cheap food  
**[0:19:28-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:28):**  The question of how we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food is an extremely challenging and emotive one  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:37):**  It's a question that's threaded throughout the stories we've shared  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:41):**  Time and again we've heard from people who acknowledge the economic barriers that currently exist  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:46):**  But their solution is not to drive prices even lower, or to find ways to produce more cheap food  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:53):**  They're looking for other solutions  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:19:55):**  For Birmingham based chef and allotmenteer Linda McFarlane, founder of Vegan Vibes  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:01):**  It's about putting vegetables at the centre of the meal in order to make delicious, nourishing food available at a low cost  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:08):**  For another Birmingham resident, Astrid Giabo, who lives in the Shardend neighbourhood  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:13):**  It's about bringing her community together to see what they can grow for themselves  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:18):**  For baker Rosie Benson, it's about enabling people to access her bread through food banks  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:23):**  By baking a number of loaves on a volunteer basis  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:26):**  Each of these examples is an expression of, and a step towards, food sovereignty  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:32):**  They show how we can start to claim agency over where our food comes from, how it's produced, how people can access it  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:40):**  And ultimately over what our entire food and farming system looks like  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:44):**  Here's Dee Woods with her thoughts on the goal of food sovereignty  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:49):**  It is extremely important that communities have control over what they eat  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:20:58):**  And I think that's what we've lost with a modern industrialised and globalised food system  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:05):**  We do not have that control anymore  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:08):**  Developing our own community farm, we will regain that  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:13):**  And people will regain some agency in terms of being able to choose  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:22):**  Another element of food sovereignty is dignity  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:25):**  Throughout the series, we've heard about the importance of dignity at every level of the food system  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:31):**  From the soil, to the plants, the animals, farm workers, farmers, processors and eaters  
**[0:21:37-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:37):**  Ursula Meire told us about her initiative, ADIRA, a Sheffield-based survivor-led service that supports black people with mental health issues  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:46):**  And in particular, she told us about ADIRA's food pharmacy project, which provided food to people in the local area during the first lockdown  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:21:54):**  As Ursula pointed out, ensuring that people have access to food can't just be a question of providing them with enough calories  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:02):**  We also need to uphold the dignity of the people eating the food  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:06):**  And in the case of emergency food provision, such as the food pharmacy, that involves making sure that it's culturally appropriate for them  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:14):**  Many of the food pharmacy volunteers were people on furlough, and as they returned to work, the pharmacy closed  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:21):**  But the need has not gone away, and ADIRA's work has not stopped  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:27):**  We didn't just, you know, close the food pharmacy and then thought, right, well that's it, off we go  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:33):**  We are padding ourselves between now and Christmas  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:37):**  There is a lot of grief at the moment because of Covid that is on pause  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:42):**  Because, you know, I've had people say to me, listen, Ursula, my husband left the house, or my son left the house in an ambulance  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:49):**  And, you know, I wasn't able to go and say goodbye because they had Covid  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:54):**  So, you know, I could only speak to them on the phone through a nurse  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:22:57):**  And then the next thing I know, they're telling me that that coffin over there has my son or has my husband in there  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:04):**  And I'm not accepting that because I didn't go through the rites or the rituals  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:08):**  I didn't get to kiss him goodbye, I didn't get to hold his hand, I didn't get to comb his hair before he died  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:14):**  So I can't grieve, so my grief is on pause because I don't believe that my husband has died, I don't believe my son has died  
**[0:23:20-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:20):**  So I said to my committee, look, when milestones hit, that's when people are going to be forced to accept and acknowledge that, oh dear God, my husband is dead  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:31):**  Because it's now Christmas and he's not here, that present under the tree is not going to be opened  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:37):**  My ten-year-old is not here, so maybe that was him in that coffin  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:41):**  And that's when the floodgates and the dams will burst open  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:45):**  So we're padding ourselves in two ways, we've started a listening training for the black community  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:51):**  Where we're training black volunteers to become listeners  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:23:55):**  And then the other thing we're doing is we're going to be giving out 500 Christmas hampers  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:00):**  And in that hamper that we will give to a single person, a couple or a family  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:05):**  Will be everything you will see on a table on Christmas day  
**[0:24:09-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:09):**  So it will have a turkey, it will have stuffing, it will have Yorkshire puddings, it will have veg, it will have Christmas pudding, which I can't stand  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:19):**  It will have non-alcoholic wine in there, so everything a person would normally have on Christmas day  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:25):**  For those people who lost their jobs over Covid or who lost the main breadwinner over Covid and have already started saying, Ursula, what am I going to do?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:33):**  I won't have money to feed my kids on Christmas day, I've already spoken to the supermarkets and said get ready because I'm coming  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:41):**  Supermarkets are supporting those in need, for example by donating excess produce through organisations like Adyra  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:48):**  And that support is welcome  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:50):**  But of course it also raises a question, why is that support needed in the first place?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:24:55):**  How can it be that there are people in Sheffield and across the UK who simply can't afford food?  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:02):**  Why is it that many of those working in the food system are underpaid and overworked in the name of keeping food prices down  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:10):**  While supermarkets generate billions of pounds in profits each year and then make very public donations to charities supporting those in food poverty  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:18):**  Take a moment to think about just how dysfunctional that is  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:22):**  How could we instead create a system in which that kind of charity isn't necessary in the first place?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:28):**  Here's Ursula again  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:30):**  As long as there's a thing called greed, we will never get there  
**[0:25:35-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:35):**  As long as there's pharmaceutical companies and all these big organisations that control the food and control the medicine and make money off of people suffering  
**[0:25:45-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:45):**  Because we could do that now, we could solve world hunger now, come on there's enough money on this planet to solve world hunger with all the billionaires that we have  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:25:55):**  And there's enough in terms of farming and come on, it can be done  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:00):**  But as long as there's greed, it's just never going to happen  
**[0:26:03-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:03):**  As long as there's mistrust being intentionally bred in terms of the way the media portrays certain communities  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:12):**  And to feed that constantly into society, you create divisions and you create mistrust  
**[0:26:18-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:18):**  And you create hatred among people where people, even if there was an opportunity to work together to solve some of the world's biggest problems  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:27):**  We don't want to do it and you just look at the world leaders  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:30):**  They can't even sit round the table together and come up with a plan that everybody agrees on  
**[0:26:36-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:36):**  Because it's just selfishness and greed and everybody at that table is just out for themselves  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:49):**  Greed assumes scarcity, it assumes that there isn't enough to go around  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:26:54):**  And yet all the stories we've heard, stories from gardens and allotments, from farms and bakeries  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:01):**  They've been characterised by a sense of abundance  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:04):**  The reality of that abundance often feels elusive  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:08):**  But when you're working with the land, with the soil, it becomes self-evident  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:13):**  And once you start to think in terms of abundance instead of scarcity  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:17):**  Sharing rather than hoarding becomes the natural thing to do  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:22):**  Sociologist Dr Lisa Palmer told us about the culture of sharing that exists on allotments  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:29):**  I think that's one of the most beautiful things about allotments spaces is the ethics and practice of sharing  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:36):**  And sharing food and exchanging food  
**[0:27:41-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:41):**  It's always exciting, it's always interesting but it also gives us insight into a different way to live  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:50):**  And to be with each other, it's not just about monetary exchange  
**[0:27:56-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:27:56):**  It might be exchanging a pumpkin for a bunch of spinach or chard or something  
**[0:28:05-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:05):**  So yeah, I kind of like the culture that exists in allotment spaces  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:14):**  Shard End resident Astrid Giabo encountered the same sense of abundance when she was setting up her growing community  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:22):**  And No Diggity Gardens Neville Portis and South East England Seed Sovereignty Coordinator Helena Schultz  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:28):**  Spoke about the abundance that springs from the practices of seed saving and seed sharing  
**[0:28:33-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:33):**  So is it possible to live in abundance? Is that the antidote to the greed that Ursula talks about?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:44):**  There are lots of reasons to be worried at the moment  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:47):**  Worried and angry and sad and just tired  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:51):**  But the voices we've heard throughout the series provide unequivocal, undeniable reasons to be hopeful  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:28:58):**  To be optimistic  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:00):**  Together they form a defiant chorus  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:03):**  One that challenges the dominant logic of industrial food  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:07):**  The journey ahead towards a truly resilient, humane and nourishing food system  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:12):**  A food system rooted in abundance  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:15):**  That journey is complex and it will be bumpy  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:18):**  But we hope that you take this as an invitation to embrace that complexity  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:23):**  To dive into it, to seek out and connect with those who feed us  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:28):**  After all, as we said right at the start of this series  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:32):**  Food doesn't come from shelves  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:34):**  Food comes from the soil, the sea and the hands of people  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:39):**  We'll leave you with a few final thoughts from some of those people  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:48):**  Being able to share a dish from your grandma with your son  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:29:54):**  Being able to share that heritage and to share the process of cultivating that meal  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:00):**  I think is a really important spiritual thing  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:03):**  Like a kind of passage to say that you've handed something over  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:08):**  What I would like to see in the future is that heritage and that legacy  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:13):**  Pulled into how we operate and look at the future  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:16):**  But with an added twist of how we implement technology  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:20):**  Into those rituals, those practices, how we implement architecture  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:25):**  And create beautiful growing spaces  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:28):**  And it's proven it's really good for our mental health and our well-being  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:33):**  I said to my kids the other day, I used to say, whenever you say to me, what's your favourite animal?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:39):**  I always say a lion because, you know, courage and all that kind of stuff  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:43):**  But now I tell them I'm a beaver  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:45):**  They build back the rivers and they build back the ecosystem by doing the right actions  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:50):**  The beaver spirit, yeah?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:52):**  The regenerative action of a beaver on what he does to a river  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:55):**  Is what I want to take on and be on my farm and be for the community as well  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:30:59):**  Everything should be linking back to the soil  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:02):**  In terms of what we put out there to people and opening up our plates to more interesting food  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:08):**  We've narrowed far too much and it's time to rediscover flavour  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:13):**  And experience and engage with where our food comes from  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:17):**  Food is more than calories  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:21):**  When you taste something that's been grown with our ecological methods  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:27):**  That's grown in season and hasn't been flown in  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:31):**  I think that just wakes people up  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:35):**  People have been rediscovering their connection to the environment  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:40):**  And they've been able to see the world  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:43):**  People have been rediscovering their connection to land  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:48):**  And to growing and nature  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:51):**  And it's intensified because of Covid that people just want to connect  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:31:59):**  That moment of just meeting more people virtually or in person  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:05):**  Who are running things in communities and are excited about changing things  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:09):**  And wanting to work with more people  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:11):**  It can only ever get bigger and it's going to be great  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:19):**  Just being out in the elements  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:21):**  And for me that's gone right to the top of how I choose to live going forward  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:27):**  And I've come back absolutely buzzing  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:30):**  I did what I wanted to do, I managed to plant, connect with people, touch the soil, open the elements  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:37):**  And yeah, I'm actually really good  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:40):**  So this phase of existence has been instrumental for me  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-6-looking-back-and-moving-forward#t=0:32:45):**  Because now I'm choosing how I want to live the rest of my life

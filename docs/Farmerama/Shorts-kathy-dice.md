**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:00):**  Late last year, I attended the perennial gathering put on by the Savannah Institute in Wisconsin.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:09):**  The Savannah Institute are laying the groundwork for widespread agroforestry in the Midwest.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:14):**  Over 100 farmers and researchers gathered to share learnings from different agroforestry  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:19):**  and silvopasture operations.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:22):**  Kathy Dice and her partner own Red Fern Farm in Iowa.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:26):**  They were some of the pioneers of the agroforestry movement in the Midwest, and their farm is  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:31):**  now a successful U-Pick perennial polyculture operation where customers pick their own produce.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:38):**  I tasted some of their fresh chestnuts, and they were literally the most delicious nut  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:43):**  I've ever had.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:45):**  Kathy tells us about a recent innovation in their U-Pick offering that really got people  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:50):**  picking.  
**[0:00:53-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:00:53):**  We have quite a collection of nut and fruit producing trees that we sell through U-Pick.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:01):**  We have chestnut trees, pop-pot trees, Asian pears, heart nuts, persimmons, and a whole  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:07):**  bunch of other things.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:09):**  We first started planting trees thinking it could be a commercial business back around  
**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:15):**  1997, and we planted in our rugged, hilly ground where we had very rough time even getting  
**[0:01:22-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:22):**  access to it.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:23):**  We couldn't get mowers up across creeks that flooded and up steep hills.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:29):**  We had heavy deer predation, and this was back before there were five foot tall ventilated  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:35):**  tree shelters available.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:36):**  The deer were constantly attacking our trees.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:39):**  We could barely keep the vegetation down because we couldn't get the mower back out there.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:45):**  Those trees just struggled and struggled.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:48):**  But then in the year 2000, our neighbors moved, and they had planted some chestnut trees on  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:55):**  our advice because they saw what we were doing.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:01:58):**  They're like, yeah, this could be really profitable.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:00):**  So they planted a whole bunch of chestnut trees, but they were moving now.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:04):**  And they asked if we would be interested in taking over their ground and buying the chestnut  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:11):**  trees.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:12):**  We were like, yes!  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:13):**  So we went and bought their orchard, and they hadn't actually, even though they had easy  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:19):**  access, they hadn't been mowing and mulching.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:21):**  So these trees had not really grown in the 10 years or so since they had been planted.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:27):**  They had planted back in 1990.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:30):**  So we started mowing, mulching, and taking care of them.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:34):**  But even that first year we got them, we were able to get a harvest of like a gallon or  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:38):**  maybe five, 10 pounds of chestnuts.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:42):**  And we knew other people who had planted chestnut trees, and we decided to all get together  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:46):**  and make a co-op.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:47):**  We would all start marketing our chestnuts together, and we all agreed it was going to  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:51):**  be really important to make sure we had good quality product, that it would be fresh, it  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:02:56):**  would be wholesome, and we would not undercut each other on the price.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:01):**  So we were like, yeah, this is a smart thing to do.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:03):**  So Tom, my husband, ended up being in charge of the co-op for about 10 years.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:09):**  And he would buy the chestnuts from other growers, he would sort them by size, he would  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:13):**  bag them up, and then he would find the customers for that.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:17):**  And in the year 2013, I think Tom bought and sold about 30,000 pounds of chestnuts.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:24):**  And this was when our own trees were starting to get really big and dropping a lot of nuts.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:28):**  And Tom didn't have time to go and harvest his own chestnuts because he was buying and  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:34):**  selling and sorting other people's chestnuts.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:36):**  And so we had to hire help to do that.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:38):**  So he told the co-op, I really can't keep doing this.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:41):**  And so there was another person in the co-op who actually was a retired salesperson, and  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:46):**  he was like, I would be interested in doing that.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:48):**  He took it over in 2014, and he has done a spectacular job with it.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:53):**  So there's still a co-op, but now Tom was available to start harvesting his own chestnuts.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:03:58):**  He had some customers who were there buying bagged chestnuts, saying, could I possibly  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:04):**  go out and harvest some chestnuts?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:06):**  My father has got cancer, he's really doing poorly.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:10):**  We really want him to have this experience.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:12):**  So he told this customer, yes, we'll let you go and harvest some chestnuts, but don't  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:16):**  tell anyone.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:18):**  And the next year, we had about three to 30 customers coming up, could I harvest chestnuts?  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:24):**  So we checked with our insurance, and it was okay.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:27):**  So we started allowing customers to go out and harvest their own chestnuts.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:32):**  And we were amazed at the response.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:35):**  And at that time, our pawpaws and persimmons were also starting to produce, and I said,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:40):**  let's try you pick on the pawpaws and persimmons too.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:44):**  And so we are now, all of our fruit and nuts are harvested for you pick, which has led  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:51):**  to the new thing that we're trying out called the leaderboard.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:54):**  We have a little chalkboard up in our way out room.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:04:58):**  And I thought, well, people are curious, what would be the most chestnuts anyone's picked  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:02):**  up in one day?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:03):**  Or what was the biggest harvest in one day?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:05):**  So I recorded that up there on the chalkboard.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:07):**  It was 265 pounds, and it was actually just one group who had done that.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:12):**  So I wrote their name by that and the date.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:14):**  And I was amazed how many people noticed that and commented on it, and then pointed out  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:20):**  a week later, well, we have harvested more chestnuts than those people.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:25):**  Maybe you should put our name up there on that.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:28):**  And that's when I started learning about what's called the leaderboard, where people who are  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:33):**  slightly competitive can have an online board where it will list their names and their place  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:39):**  like first, second, third place.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:41):**  So I bought the biggest whiteboard I could find.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:45):**  And I put it up and I started recording for chestnuts, Asian pears, pawpaws, persimmons,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:53):**  who had the biggest harvest so far the year.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:05:57):**  And it started out with 6.5 pounds of chestnuts with one family.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:01):**  And then within a week, that was up to 80 pounds.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:04):**  And I had to add in heartnuts down at the bottom.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:07):**  And my whiteboard was starting to get really squished with writing in all this information.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:12):**  But it was very fun.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:14):**  And the customers really liked it.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:16):**  And they would, when I was putting their name up on the board, I would often ask people,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:20):**  is it okay if I put your name up on the leaderboard?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:23):**  And then they would take their picture by the leaderboard, because they were proud.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:27):**  They see we're on the leaderboard.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:30):**  And I would post the leaderboard, a photo of it, up on our Facebook page every week  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:35):**  too.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:36):**  And I really loved it if I had pictures of the people out there harvesting to go up with  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:40):**  their names too.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:41):**  And it was amazing, the response and how proud people were about that leaderboard and their  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:47):**  placement on the leaderboard.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:49):**  Next year, I'm getting an even bigger leaderboard.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:52):**  For the business perspective, I found it convenient because I would have people who would harvest  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:06:56):**  like 10 pounds of pawpaws and say, oh, this is a pretty big harvest for you.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:00):**  And I would say, look over at the leaderboard and say, well, actually, you know, and they  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:04):**  would look at the leaderboard and go, oh, 40 pounds?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:08):**  And then they would notice, oh, somebody got 250 pounds of chestnuts?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:12):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:14):**  So it was more just a way of enriching the experience for the customers, making them  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:18):**  feel like it was a fun experience.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:21):**  And maybe even tying them in to realizing how other people have been out here too and  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:25):**  what they had done.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:26):**  So I think they liked that.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:27):**  And the other thing I also did this year is I have a big map up on our bulletin board.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:34):**  We have a map of the United States and also a map of the world.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:38):**  And I'll ask customers, please put a thumbtack up from what you consider home or where you  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:42):**  were born.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:44):**  And so they do that for the United States.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:46):**  But I also have wonderful map snap pinpoints for all over the world for our customers.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:52):**  In Laos, Albania, Bosnia, Rome, it's just really cool.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:07:59):**  Our best customers are people who immigrated either five to 20 years ago, and they remember  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:05):**  picking up chestnuts in their home country with their family.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:09):**  And they want to re-experience that again.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:12):**  And they're delighted when they can come out to our farm and do it.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:15):**  And that's one of the most delightful parts of the You Pick business is seeing the big  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:20):**  smiles on some of these grandmothers and elderly men who come out, and they're seeing the chestnuts  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:26):**  on the ground, and they're gathering them.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:28):**  I remember an elderly gentleman from Vietnam had just this big smile as he was picking  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:33):**  up the chestnuts and cradling them in the crook of his arm.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:36):**  And I was like, let me get you a bucket.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:37):**  Let me get you a bucket.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:38):**  And he just wouldn't stop.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:39):**  He just kept going for more and more chestnuts.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:43):**  All I would say is chestnuts are a wonderful way to meet a diversity of people living in  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:49):**  the United States.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:50):**  And it's been a delightful experience.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:53):**  Chestnuts are an excellent crop that is sustainable and very profitable, but you have to make  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:08:58):**  sure your soil and site is compatible for them because chestnuts will not grow for everyone  
**[0:09:03-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-cathy-dice#t=0:09:03):**  everywhere.

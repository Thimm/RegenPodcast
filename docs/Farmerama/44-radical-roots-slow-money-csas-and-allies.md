**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  This month we explore radical roots and cider apples with a farming couple in Oregon.  We hear about a different type of investment, the slow money movement.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:20):**  We talk to CSAs in Northern Ireland and we end with a call for allyship in the kitchen  from a passionate chef.  Kim Hamblin and Dan Rinke live down a little track in rural Oregon where they have a beautiful  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:38):**  experimental farm, Rochambeau Art Farm.  The duo have a deep understanding of what it means to be regenerative farmers and are  crafting a farming landscape that's focused on resilience.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:50):**  They have a cider and wine label called Art & Science, which is currently made from wild  foraged apples and fruits, but they've started planting apple trees from seedlings on their  40 acres, as well as many other trees.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:04):**  Here's Dan and Kim talking to us through seedlings, roots and resilience.  Hi, I'm Kim Hamblin and I am co-owner with Dan Rinke of Art & Science Cider and Wine.  We have a farm, about 50 acres, and it's kind of a mixed-use farm.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:25):**  We do a music fest annually, so I like to have a lot of fun doing different things.  Hi, I'm Dan Rinke and I am the other co-owner of Rochambeau Art Farm.  We are in, or just between Sheridan and Willamina, Oregon.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:40):**  In our rootstock orchard, it's about a four and a half acre orchard, we have 70 different  apple varieties, a little bit over 20 different pear varieties, and just over a dozen quince  varieties.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:58):**  In between each of those varieties, we planted a non-malus, non-cydonia, non-pirus species,  and that could be anything from black locust to honey locust to ash, an alder, maple, willow,  elderberry, hazelnuts, just a very vast, diverse selection of plants.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:28):**  As far as the potential negative aspects of this would be, harvesting is going to be a  pain in the butt.  There's a lot of different varieties and a lot of different things going on out there.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:40):**  It's not as easy as a regular monoculture cropping situation like the rest of the country  does, but as far as I see it, I think it's going to create more resilient plants and  more interconnectedness within the plant and microbiological communities, creating more  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:03):**  resilient and potentially healthier plants.  It should create a more expansive hyphal network between plants and allow the different plants  to potentially pass nutrients and water and hormones from plant to plant, which could  
**[0:03:27-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:27):**  help with just the overall health of the plant and also their disease and insect resistances.  One of the main things that I'm looking at is creating a very healthy soil microbial  food web and a vast system of mycelium.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:50):**  Within the mycelium and the mycorrhizae that grow in the soil and on the plants, there  are specific species that have two associations with mycorrhizae, the two different mycorrhizae.  There's the endomycorrhizae and the ectomycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:06):**  Species like Aldaberry and Willow have both associations to both mycorrhizae.  I think it's really important to have these hub-like species out there to bridge the gaps  between the two different types of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:26):**  The seedling orchard, we just planted this last fall, so in 2018, and it's about 10 acres.  The grid is a 60 by 60 spacing on the apples.  It's mostly apples, a little bit of pears.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:43):**  The reason we did it was because we wanted to have more resilient trees.  Seedling trees tend to tap root down, so most of them are apples and they form a natural  trap.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:56):**  You plant the seed and it just keeps going.  Dan, would you like to talk about the radical?  The primary radical of the seedling.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:05):**  As a seed germinates, it creates one primary radical, which then becomes the tap root.  That goes straight down and becomes the main root of the tree.  The difference is that normally apple trees are grown on rootstocks.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:23):**  The rootstocks come from a stick cutting, so then all the roots come from the periphery  of the edge of the stick.  There's no one main radical.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:35):**  One of those roots may become a little bit more dominant than the others, but it's not  one single root.  There was a seedling over by the front porch.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:45):**  We used to do all our processing on the patio illegally.  Some of the mash would wash off when we washed the patio.  Some seeds just planted themselves.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:58):**  Most of the time we just dug them up or they'd wither away after some neglect.  This one tree would not die.  I kept running it over with a hose back and forth.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:08):**  It was right in the middle of a corner between two patios, so it was in this really weird  spot.  It just kept living.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:16):**  I just let it go because I was like, well, you want to live.  I'm going to let it go.  I just dug it up and it was probably about four feet tall.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:23):**  I dug as far as I could and then I just snapped off the tap.  It was damn near the size of the tree, and I think it probably was if I kept going.  It really had one main tap and then some secondary ones coming off.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:38):**  It was really interesting to see how that one looked versus some of my potted ones.  I also have a little nursery where we potted up some of the compost pile, some of the seedlings  just popped up in the compost.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:51):**  I dug them up and put them in a pot and kept them.  We had some root stock ones that we grafted.  I looked at those two side by side.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:59):**  I opened them up and shook off the roots just to see what the differences were.  It was really interesting because the seedling ones, even though some of them were only a  year old, had tapped through the pot and went in through the cloth underneath and down into  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:14):**  the ground.  They really wanted to get in the damn ground.  So it's like, all right, you want to live.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:20):**  I appreciate that resiliency.  So that's kind of what we want for future cider production and future climate change  and all the good stuff.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:30):**  Climate change forecast has shown that the Pacific Northwest is just going to get hotter  and drier.  Currently we don't have water rights, and so we don't really have the ability to irrigate  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:42):**  our crop.  And this will help circumnavigate, get over that problem by just having a deeper taproot  and more resilient trees that can live through droughts.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:56):**  The other thing I have to say about propagating an orchard by seed is we're also helping change  the genetic makeup and the diversity of the plants by allowing some genetic changes.  The way apples and grapes and most of our agricultural perennial crops are grown nowadays  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:21):**  is that they're taken from clonal selection.  So there's no way for evolution to happen, where if you're taking it from seed, you're  allowing more evolution or the chance of evolution to happen and possibly overcoming some of  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:36):**  the disease issues that we deal with in modern farming.  And then also on that same note is making a true American species of apple, because  right now most of the cider industry is copying the English or the French.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:49):**  So they're importing these same varieties that they grow in other countries across the  world and planting them in America and like, oh, we make cider now, you know, instead of  like we actually have American cider varieties and it's endless how many we can have.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:04):**  So it's actually kind of fun to be part of that movement too of like, this is going to  be future cider in 10 years.  I think the one easy thing is to keep in mind that with diversity comes resilience.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:19):**  I never really considered, I don't know why, but the idea that clones were sort of evading  evolutionary, or evading evolution and not allowing seeds or seed or lines of genetics  to evolve.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:40):**  And I think that actually that, you know, when Dan and Kim pointed that out to me, it  really made me think hard about the importance of what they're doing in terms of, you know,  planting seedlings, okay, it may not be as quick and easy to get those trees to start,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:01):**  but actually if we just keep using clones in all of our, and specific rootstocks in  all of our trees that we're planting, that is actually setting us up for potential large  scale failure because everything's got the same makeup.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:23):**  So it's the opposite of diversity and yeah, so it was really interesting they pointed  that out and I'd love to hear about more people who are working in that way.  Woody Tash is the most bright-eyed, socially and environmentally responsible financier  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:39):**  we've ever met.  He worked for over 30 years in finance, managing other people's money, but 10 years ago he  took a radical step and started the Slow Money movement.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:51):**  Now if you look at the numbers, Slow Money walks a fine line between philanthropy and  investment.  But the whole point of Slow Money is that the return on an investment is the regeneration  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:03):**  of the soil and ultimately the health of the local community and planet.  That is what people are investing in.  Financially, they want to have their loan paid back if possible, although that doesn't  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:17):**  always happen.  But the gain or the return is regenerated soils and healthy community.  This is pretty radical and it can take some time to get your head around.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:34):**  This is not about numbers, doing these numbers versus doing those numbers.  This is about reaffirming the primacy of words over the claims on our attention made by numbers.  Reaffirming the primacy of relationships over the claims of transactions.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:52):**  Reaffirming the primacy of nutrition over the claims of cheap calories.  Reaffirming the primacy of places over the claims of markets.  Reaffirming the primacy of generations and seasons over the claims of milliseconds and  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:09):**  algorithms.  Reaffirming the primacy of putting back in over the claims of taking out.  What is Slow Money?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:18):**  Slow Money is a shared vision of the importance of, and I'll say several things nested together,  thinking very long term, being patient.  The patience leads to the idea of slow.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:35):**  Thinking more about preserving and restoring soil fertility than about extracting financial  returns.  But all of those things, the conversation about all those things is something that's  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:48):**  turned into the Slow Money movement.  And then from that conversation, a network of networks, if you will, a bunch of small  local groups sprouted up, mostly in the West, few in Canada, a little bit in France, a tiny  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:58):**  bit now in Australia, where groups of people who have been participating in this conversation,  you could call it sharing a vision, you could call it participating in an active conversation  trying to help one another move in a radical new direction.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:13):**  Those conversations and that network has led to the flow of $70 million into almost 700  small food enterprises, everything from individual organic farms to food processing, distribution,  restaurants, slaughterhouses, cheese makers, seed companies, anything that is helping get  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:31):**  local organic produce from the producer into the local market.  So it's very local, small dots, groups of people collaborating together actively to  help one another do that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:41):**  From a financial standpoint, a little bit you could say that Slow Money is staking out  territory between investing and philanthropy.  So the first 0% loan that our new group in Boulder gave was to a farm and restaurant  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:54):**  in Boulder where the farm family has dedicated themselves to growing as much as possible  that they serve in the restaurant from their own farm.  And they were farming 200 acres and they just leased another 200 acres and they had no walk-in  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:07):**  cooler on the second farm.  They only had the cooler in the restaurant.  So we lent them $12,000 so they could have a walk-in cooler on the second farm.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:16):**  So very fairly straightforward, I guess you'd say.  There are lots of other examples that are on slowmoney.org.  I mean, there are hundreds of things like lending $5,000 for a hoop house or a few thousand  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:27):**  dollars for drip irrigation line, things like that.  Gradually moving up to like buying a used tractor or a refrigerated truck or things  like that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:35):**  A very smart person in a recent public conversation talked about investing yourself versus investing  money and that's a big part of it.  It's what does it mean to invest?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:47):**  If investing means just giving your money to some stranger so they can grow the money  arithmetically, that's one kind of investing.  If investing means taking time and energy and committing yourself to something because  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:56):**  it's a cause you believe in, that's a different kind of investing.  The consumer part is obvious.  That's Slow Food and a whole bunch of other people who are mobilizing consumers to intentionally  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:07):**  drive their consumer dollars.  So we're kind of coming up fast, coming up slowly with the investor part, saying we've  got to bring our investor dollars there.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:17):**  I'm not going to say it's more fundamental but it's as fundamentally important because  if we buy all of our food from a CSA or a farmer's market but our money is invested  in the industrial system, we're certainly compromising deeply that which we're trying  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:29):**  to do.  From my experience in Slow Money to date, I am convinced there are many millions of  people, how many?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:35):**  It's hard to say, but many millions of people who really want something like this to happen.  They want to reconnect.  They want to bring their money back down to earth.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:43):**  They want to fully value things in the earth and in their community.  And it's hard at the beginning.  I mean, we're just at the beginning.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:50):**  It's hard, but I think this is a generational shift.  So we all just have to keep at it.  If you want to know more about this form of investment and the people who support and  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:01):**  benefit from it, we'll be releasing a full-length interview with Woody as a short later this  week.  So check our feed for that.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:10):**  We're keen to support Slow Money efforts.  So is there anyone out there who wants to start up a Slow Money group where you are?  Let us know and we can put you in touch with Woody and the team.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:27):**  Now we're back to Jubilee Farm where Johnny is reporting from their recent CSA Ambassadors  event with the UK and Ireland CSA Networks.  We're here at Jubilee Farm this month hosting an event called Across Borders, which is organized  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:44):**  by the CSA UK Network and the CSA Network of Ireland, a joint event looking at the potential  of the community-supported agriculture model for farming in Northern Ireland.  I'm joined by Marissa from the UK Network and Roisin from the Ireland Network.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:03):**  And together we're going to think a little bit about the potential of CSA for agriculture  here.  So Marissa, why the CSA model for farming and for food in Northern Ireland?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:14):**  So we wanted to do this event because we obviously cover the whole of the UK and thus far CSA  hasn't developed as much in Northern Ireland as it has in other areas.  So we have quite a lot of CSAs in Wales, they're starting to grow in Scotland.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:34):**  We've had quite a few in England for a while.  So it's a model we want to bring to Northern Ireland.  We're starting to get a lot of inquiries from Northern Ireland.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:46):**  The model is basically where the consumers share the risks and rewards of farming with  the producer.  So for small-scale farmers, it's a way for farming to be more viable because they have  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:01):**  a customer base, a reliable customer base.  And for consumers, the benefits are getting fresh local produce, learning about farming  and sustainability, and also the benefits of, you know, social benefits of being part  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:18):**  of a community, volunteering, going down to the farm.  So we think that's beneficial for farms here as well as everywhere else in the UK.  As far as you know, Jubilee Farm is the first community-supported agriculture scheme in  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:33):**  Northern Ireland.  As you mentioned, Marasa, we're hoping that there'll be lots more.  And Northern Ireland obviously has a troubled history and yet we're here today to have the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:47):**  message that CSAs work across borders.  So Roisin, particularly at this time with lots of political and economic turbulence  and events, particularly difficult for Northern Ireland caught in the middle and for food  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:00):**  and farming too, why is it so important to have a CSA cross-border event at this time?  I told myself this morning I wouldn't use the word Brexit today.  CSA beyond borders is not just about beyond the border, you know, whether hard or soft  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:18):**  or whatever it is on the island of Ireland, but across the world.  And this, Marasa and I met in Thessaloniki at a community-supported agriculture international  event organised by Roisin and it was there that we plotted the idea to have this event.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:33):**  And my mother last week went to a CSA in Germany next to where my brother lives in Germany  and the welcome that she received there and the on-the-ground effort to provide food,  to live in a community where people have real relationships based on trust, on resilience  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:52):**  and that kind of thing.  And we experienced it last night, staying with Jenny and her hospitality and meeting  you this morning.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:58):**  And we know it from other CSAs that we've visited, be it in Ireland, be it in the UK,  be it in Scotland, it doesn't matter what the names of the places are, the people are  always the same.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:07):**  Let's hope that Jubilee Farm is only the first of many CSAs in Northern Ireland.  Absolutely.  Good luck.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:17):**  Thank you.  You're off to a great start.  Thank you so much.

**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:21):**  Brenda Ruiz is a chef and food educator from Sacramento, California.  She spoke to us last autumn at Terra Madre in Turin, where she represented Slow Food  USA, and she took her son Alex along with her.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:35):**  We were struck by her dedication to allyship and collaboration, and her words really hit  home about the importance of speaking out and looking out for others in our working  environment.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:46):**  She reminds us that good restaurants and farms are about food sourced with integrity, and  that goes hand in hand with treating people with integrity.  Who are you an ally for?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:57):**  And who are your allies?  Can you build up more of a culture of allyship where you work?  My name is Brenda Ruiz.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:05):**  I'm a chef in Sacramento, California.  I do cooking and nutrition education with K through 12 youth, paired with school district  programs and after school district programs.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:19):**  And that was after being in a professional kitchen, different restaurants in Sacramento,  for over 20 years.  When my son was born, I knew I needed to consider transitioning that skill set to a schedule  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:35):**  that was more in line with what was going to be soon his school schedule.  Terra Madre has been an amazing experience so far, and I'm blessed to be able to share  it this time around with my nine-year-old son, Alex.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:50):**  When Terra Madre was being planned and scheduled, he expressed an interest in continuing to  attend these global gatherings, and so it's just cool to keep it going and to share this  with him.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:04):**  The panel that we attended today was so excellent, and my question to the panelists was really  around the importance of allyships and having allies and not only being a good ally to other  colleagues but also being good at receiving and asking help.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:24):**  I think one of the panelists answered the question as an exchange of skills.  So it's not really asking for help and receiving help or working together on something because  maybe the object is heavy to lift or there's a—as women are traditional, bear the roles  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:45):**  of raising family, might need to leave a shift early or have an extra shift pick up.  That if we have ways of supporting allyships, that creates a healthier restaurant structure.  And so I've been really lucky to work in places where those allyships were intentional and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:10):**  sometimes even nuanced, but it always came from the leadership.  And whenever I've had times when I didn't feel supported, it was when allyships were  not something that was part of the culture of that kitchen.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:28):**  So I guess the point is that until we have equity, not just equality, but until we have  equity for women in the workplace, that these types of collaborative and allyship approach  I think is really helpful for women to be able to succeed in their careers.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:53):**  And I've been blessed to enjoy colleagues that have provided me that support and allyship  where I didn't feel like I was being coddled or helped out for being weak.  It was really collaborative.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:08):**  And I think that can translate to other professions as well.  As we've seen in the news of the Me Too movement of the last few years, that it's not just  enough to march a couple of times a year, but they're everyday examples of being allies  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:24):**  with each other, women to women, or in between men and women.  Or men to men, if someone is being unkind or not being very supportive of a colleague  that's female, that the other colleagues step out and say, come on now, that was not cool,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:46):**  man.  That was not cool.  I'm not going to let that happen again.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:50):**  So I think I may am using that word allyship or allies, but it is part of a culture of  being, approaching getting through the nightly service as a collaboration.  Not this like each to himself, because sometimes you do feel it's a very much like a battle  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:12):**  that's about to happen.  So you get ready, battle station ready, because it's almost 530, so you know that we're going  to be very busy.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:22):**  But that we always keep in mind that it's a collaboration, we all have the common goal.  Just that little shift can help a little bit.  One thing that I do a lot and received a lot in the kitchen was I'm a Spanish speaker.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:41):**  I'm a native Spanish speaker in a lot of restaurants in the United States.  The prep crew, the chefs that prepare the food for the fancy chefs that cook the line  are Spanish speakers.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:53):**  So I was often asked to play a role, a translating role, either between management or between  colleagues.  I felt I could be a good ally to my Spanish speaking colleagues and as well as on occasion  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:11):**  also be a good advocate if there was something that was being discussed that was a sensitive  nature.  I could help my Hispanic or Latino colleague in their conversation with the management  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:27):**  or another colleague.  Like no, we've got to say it this way because this is the way we're going to get through  this conversation.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:36):**  And there's many examples of that type.  So yeah, I felt it was a responsibility sometimes to bear that, but it's something I do and  did with a lot of pride.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:56):**  And so I'd like to see restaurants really be intentional about promoting allies, allyship,  and when folks step out of their way to be helpful, that should be recognized as something  good and not like a sign of weakness.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:15):**  I recognize that the small farming community and the chef community, we have a lot in common,  but oftentimes we're on different schedules.  So you guys are waking up and we're just getting to bed and somehow we've managed to make that  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:28):**  work all these years.  So keep up the good work.  Farmerama is made by Katie Revell, Joe Barrett, and myself, Abbey Rose.

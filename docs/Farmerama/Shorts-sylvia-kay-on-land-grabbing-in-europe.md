**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:00:00):**  My name is Sylvia Kaye, I'm a researcher at the Transnational Institute, TNI for short.  We're an international think tank based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Yeah, and we work on lots of different issues related to globalisation from a kind of critical  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:00:22):**  perspective.  So we have different teams working on different issues.  Yeah, everything from international drug policy reform to looking at how to maintain key public  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:00:34):**  services in public ownership.  My team, which I'm part of, is the environmental and agrarian justice team.  So it's kind of looking at the politics around key natural resources like land, food, fisheries,  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:00:48):**  seeds, forests, and how we can kind of make the kind of models of governance around them  more democratic and particularly empower the people that actually produce the food and  rural communities that depend on these natural resources for their livelihoods.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:01:05):**  How can we put them in the heart of decision making when it comes to how these kind of  natural resources are governed.  What do you expect from participating in this meeting?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:01:18):**  So I'm participating in this European Rural Sustainability Gathering for the first time,  actually.  I hadn't heard about it before, but it just so happened that someone who I knew in the  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:01:30):**  Netherlands who attended a previous meeting of this Forum Synergies event had really recommended  it to me as a great kind of networking opportunity.  So to come into contact with lots of different actors from all over Europe with different  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:01:46):**  perspectives.  And I think it for me has been a really nice opportunity to gain some insight into how  practitioners kind of experience rural development and rural development thinking and implementation  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:02:01):**  of plans, the kind of challenges and issues that come up with how different actors are  involved and how sort of at a more regional and local level decision making can really  be made more democratic.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:02:18):**  And I was also, I have to say, very much attracted that it was happening in Greece this year  because I think the theme also really spoke to me of this year's gathering, which was  sustainability in a time of crisis, which I think, yeah, there are multiple crises going  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:02:34):**  on and I think it's a very relevant theme and it's very pertinent then to also hold  it in Greece for that reason.  So one of your leaflets mentions that you are actually advocating against land grabbing.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:02:47):**  Is that right?  So can you define what do you mean by land grabbing?  Yeah, so land grabbing, we explicitly don't provide an authoritative, definitive way or  
**[0:03:01-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:03:01):**  definition of land grabbing, unlike some policymakers who are more powerful actors who are very  interested in having a very fixed legal definition of the term land grabbing.  We think that land grabbing is not necessarily something that's illegal, although often it  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:03:17):**  is.  Often communities are not consulted at all, their land tenure rights are not respected,  sometimes there's elements of corruption and other kind of irregularities.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:03:32):**  But we argue that even if these very large scale land deals were made more transparent  and procedures were made more regular, that there are still issues to consider around  the impact these kind of large scale land deals and the model of development that they  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:03:47):**  often represent.  It's often a model of development which takes land away from sort of more small scale multifunctional  uses towards a model which is much more geared towards industrial type production models  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:04:05):**  and geared much more to a kind of extractive model where wealth is extracted from the area  and doesn't necessarily get returned to the area.  So we argue that those are also very important elements to consider, so the whole kind of  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:04:19):**  social justice element of a land deal is also very important and we would consider both  the process and the substance important elements to consider.  And how do you think that we can tackle this land grabbing?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:04:33):**  Yeah I think we can tackle land grabbing through different elements, I mean and I'm not saying  that there's a sort of one size fits all solution and that I have all the answers, but at the  Transnational Institute we work on kind of two levels I would say.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:04:52):**  One is really empowering local communities and kind of organized networks of for example  small scale food producers to really be aware of their rights, to be able to claim and defend  their rights as well.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:05:07):**  So we do kind of trainings and workshops with them to really help them amplify their voices  and claim their rights.  And the trainings that we do are often based on how they can use kind of key policy instruments,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:05:26):**  so one of the key policy instruments that we work with are these international guidelines  which are called the guidelines for the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and  forests and they were elaborated at the United Nations Committee on World Food Security with  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:05:43):**  the key participation and voice of those most affected and those most marginalized, so small  scale food producers actually negotiated those guidelines alongside the governments and they  have a much more human rights based approach when it comes to land tenure rights rather  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:06:02):**  than a purely kind of market or commodity approach.  And so yeah we work with local communities to help them understand those guidelines better  and how they can use them.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:06:15):**  And then like I said the second dimension is then working at doing some kind of advocacy  work with public policy makers to really also point out their responsibility to implement  those guidelines.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:06:32):**  But can you make this connection between land and human rights, can you define this perspective  of the people that feel the problem?  Absolutely I would say that land and human rights are very much connected.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:06:54):**  Land is often treated just as a simple item of merchandise, as a simple commodity that  can just be traded on a land market based on a kind of what the World Bank calls a willing  buyer willing seller model, so it's basically if you can mobilize enough if you want to  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:07:10):**  sell your land and there's a buyer that can mobilize enough capital a trade in land can  take place.  But what we argue is that land is much more than just a simple factor of production, it  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:07:25):**  has a real significance not just economically, the fact that rural communities depend on  the land for their livelihoods, it also has cultural significance, many people in rural  areas feel a real sense of belonging and connection to the land and it's the basis for social  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:07:44):**  organization for the continuation of many traditions and a way of living and so we feel  that those elements definitely are under considered.  And what we argue is that beyond just having legal ownership over land it's also important  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:08:07):**  to recognize and this is where things like those guidelines that I was referring to  earlier are very useful that communities, some of them have legitimate tenure rights,  so these are rights that are not necessarily enshrined in law but through years of customary  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:08:24):**  practice or informal practice they have gained legitimate kind of a claim over this land.  And so for that reason there's a whole argument to be made that land is a key vehicle for  the realization of multiple economic, social and cultural rights.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:08:43):**  You also mentioned that, can you describe your aspiration to create a land observatory,  what is this observatory going to be, what is it's vision, it's goals?  So T&I together with a number of other social movements and civil society organizations  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:09:05):**  has been fighting for quite a while in Europe actually to create what we call a European  land observatory and this is based on the fact that we've identified that there are  real land problems in Europe, it's often assumed that in Europe there are no kind of, that  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:09:24):**  the land question is closed, that we have a kind of well-functioning land market.  But what we've identified, and this is based on some research and case studies that we've  documented together with key social movement actors like European coordination of Via Campesina  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:09:43):**  which is the peasants movement in Europe, they've documented various different case  studies of land issues in Europe and they range from everything from land grabbing,  we can speak of land grabbing in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe, but also land speculation,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:10:01):**  so simply land is being farmed, productive fertile farmland is being bought up, not with  the intention to produce anything but simply to hold it as an investment or hold it as  purely as a sort of speculative investment which is then sold off after a few years for  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:10:17):**  a much higher price.  Also problems around what's sometimes referred to as land artificialisation, it's a kind  of term that's used by French activists and it refers to farmland, fertile farmland that  
**[0:10:34-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:10:34):**  is brought out of agricultural production and is kind of re-zoned and reclassified for  various other purposes, everything from big infrastructure projects, urbanisation, tourism  and golf courses and it sometimes has real problems because it means that farmers are  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:10:59):**  deprived of access to land.  So there's a kind of range of problems around land in Europe and the reason we're then calling  for this European land observatory is to monitor much closer what is going on throughout Europe  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:11:16):**  when it comes to those different aspects of those kind of land problems I was talking  about and actually it's based on the fact that there is no real pan-European tool to  monitor what is going on around farmland in Europe.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:11:32):**  There are some national level databases and some statistics that do accumulate some facts  at European level but not in any kind of coherent or comprehensive fashion and so we're calling  for this European land observatory to monitor things like the price of land, also the rental  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:11:51):**  price, ownership structure but also things like key environmental and social criteria  so employment levels, soil quality, just to gain a much better insight and to better inform  decision making around land.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:12:10):**  You also mentioned words like food sovereignty and sufficiency, how can you guarantee that  these concepts are not used to an exclusionary political discourse, how can you fight against  these let's say occupations of the meanings of some words like these?  
**[0:12:38-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:12:38):**  So one of the solutions we see to land grabbing issues and this land concentration dynamics,  many other problems around the food system in Europe and worldwide is this concept of  food sovereignty and food sovereignty as it's defined by Via Campesina for example is seen  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:13:05):**  really as the opportunity to take back control of the food system away from a kind of state  of monopoly power which these big agro input providers, these big food processors and retailers  and transnational corporations really have a kind of monopoly power over the food system  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:13:28):**  and what food sovereignty seeks to do is to really politicise and democratise the food  system and to argue that people have the right to decide their own food system based on healthy  and environmentally sound production methods and it really puts food producers and the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:13:49):**  people that work the land at the heart of decision making.  But there is a challenge in using this term food sovereignty and it's a challenge that  emerges when we talk about who is the sovereign really in food sovereignty and there are different  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:14:07):**  debates around that and it's not always sometimes clearly defined who is the sovereign in food  sovereignty, is it the farmers and the small farmers and other food producers like the  fishers and pastoralists and indigenous peoples, is it the state and does the state then have  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:14:27):**  some sovereign power over the food system, is it the people however vaguely they are  defined and it's a kind of grey area and some of the danger I see in that is that some  of the language around sovereignty can be captured by groups or political parties or  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:14:51):**  people of a particular political leaning that have a very different vision.  So I'm thinking here of for example can this kind of term sovereignty be captured by the  rise of authoritarian populist parties, right wing extremists that also talk about taking  
**[0:15:08-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:15:08):**  back control and also talk about having a kind of anti-globalisation rhetoric but they  use the term sovereignty I believe in a way in which it creates new exclusions, it's often  for a very particular set of people that they have in mind and the vision of food sovereignty  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:15:34):**  certainly that the European movement and international movement for food sovereignty would subscribe  to which is also referred to as the Nihileni movement for food sovereignty, it's a vision  that totally rejects any form of discrimination, xenophobia or racism and it's a food sovereignty  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:15:52):**  that doesn't seek to reward only a particular group of people to the detriment of another  group of people.  But yeah I still see it as something that we should be very careful against.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:16:06):**  You also mentioned the will of your team to bridge the chasm between citizens and scientists.  How do you define, can you explain how you actually intend to bridge this division between  these communities?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:16:29):**  At TNI we have a way of doing research and a way of doing our analysis and our work which  we call scholar activism and it's based a bit on this idea that neither purely academic  or purely scientific knowledge nor knowledge that emanates from the grassroots and from  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:16:57):**  lived experience and from field practice, neither they, both sets don't hold exclusive  value and exclusive knowledge and it's an approach which seeks to sort of blend insights  and experience from both those two realms and it's a way in which we seek to do kind  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:17:20):**  of what we also call a co-production of knowledge.  So a lot of the analysis that TNI does is peer reviewed in a kind of academic sense  and we have key experts from the academic or expert field that review our work but it's  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:17:36):**  work that's often informed by case studies that we do together with social movement actors,  that they provide us with key case studies.  Sometimes we will even do pieces of joint writing and joint analysis and it's also the  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-sylvia-kay#t=0:17:53):**  mission a bit of our research is research that empowers those kind of social movement  actors but without losing the also cutting edge intellectual and academic rigour.

**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:23):**  This month we have voices on three continents. We begin with a cider making collective in  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:28):**  Chile. Then Abby is talking to aqua ecologists Nicole Masters about a tool they've worked  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:33):**  on together. And finally we hear from an innovative whisky distillery who are working closely  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:38):**  with farmers.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:44):**  Juan y Lisboa is one of a collective of friends in Chile who set up Agricula Sin Patrones.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:50):**  They make extremely delicious natural cider, sourced from local campesino or peasant farmers.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:00:57):**  The vast swathes of this region where Juan y works have had the native forests destroyed  
**[0:01:02-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:02):**  and never-ending monocultural pine plantations put in their place. The Agricula Sin Patrones  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:09):**  team are finding ways to empower those still farming small plots of land in this landscape  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:17):**  as they are a vital part of retaining at least some of the diversity that was once all around.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:24):**  We asked Juan y to tell us more, starting with their name.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:31):**  Agricula Sin Patrones means farmers without bosses. We are five partners who are egalitarian  
**[0:01:39-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:39):**  partners. We own the same shares of the company and there's nobody who commands over anybody.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:47):**  They're just different skills and if somebody is better skilled than something then he could  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:01:53):**  have the word. But the decision is always collective here and that's what we want to  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:00):**  do. Historically the relationship, especially in the countryside in Latin America in general,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:07):**  it has been very bossy and even slave-like in past history. We want to change that too.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:18):**  We want to make it so people who live in the countryside are not having to obey anybody  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:25):**  as if that somebody is their owner. They can have a decision. That's how we want to live  
**[0:02:32-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:32):**  too. We've been working in this area where between these huge plantations of pine trees  
**[0:02:41-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:41):**  and other exotic species, there are some vineyards and some apple orchards hidden between them.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:51):**  We've worked making wine and we saw these apple trees and we wanted to give value to  
**[0:02:59-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:02:59):**  it and to the people who've been taking care of them since generations. That was the first  
**[0:03:08-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:08):**  motivation to try to save these lands from converting everything into this green desert  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:19):**  that you can actually see. What we do is that we take these apples from heritage and unknown  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:26):**  varieties from very small farmers, what you could call a peasant farmer. The Spanish word  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:33):**  would be campesino. We take these apples and we try to make the best natural cider that  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:40):**  we can with absolutely no additives and try to show that to the world. That's what we're  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:47):**  trying to do. How do we do that? Well, our team is made up of unique people. There's  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:03:53):**  a brewing master, there's another specialist in wine, there's another specialist in viticulture,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:00):**  there's another guy who's the fourth generation of cider makers. We're trying to get the best  
**[0:04:05-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:05):**  out from this team that we work with. With that, with our effort, trying to make people  
**[0:04:15-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:15):**  all over the place see the value that's hidden in these countrysides. That's mainly because  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:24):**  of how people have been taking care of their lands. We haven't been involved in that. We're  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:30):**  just showing it. The farms where we get the apples from are, a lot of people could think  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:38):**  that they're not even farms. These are their homes. What they grow, they usually grow it  
**[0:04:46-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:46):**  for themselves or a little bit to sell. They usually have to work around because they have  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:04:59):**  that little land that you can't make a living of it. The apple trees that they have, they  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:04):**  didn't have any value before. A couple of generations before when raising pigs was more  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:11):**  usual, they would usually give them to pigs. Right now, it's mainly because these farmers  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:18):**  are very old, they don't do it anymore. They were just losing these apples. We're trying  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:25):**  to improve their situation, give them a little extra income by buying these apples. It's  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:32):**  not like if they could sell it to somebody else because there's nobody else buying it.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:37):**  By that way, we want to improve their living, their livelihood and also attract people to  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:49):**  the countryside. You can actually stay here and you can do stuff. That's one of the messages  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:05:55):**  that we want to send. We have three different labels and that has to do absolutely with  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:01):**  the origin of the apples. There's one that's called Temprano because it's from the earliest  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:08):**  apples that we get. That's actually one of the few varieties that we actually recognize.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:14):**  It's a variety called Candelaria because it's harvested right by the Fiesta de la Candelaria,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:19):**  which is a religious party that goes on. The other one is called Carrizal and it's because  
**[0:06:25-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:25):**  it's harvested in that location. It's a small sector up in the coastal range here in Chile.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:36):**  It gets way more rainfall so you get a way lighter cider, which has been a great surprise  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:43):**  for us. Finally, the first one that we made is called 42 manzanas, 42 apple trees. That's  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:52):**  because when we started, that's all we got, 42 apple trees and we just wanted to make  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:06:58):**  the best out of them. I would love to know, what are the apples that other cider makers  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:03):**  are growing in the world? Because one of the mysteries here is that although we do recognize  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:09):**  some of these heritage varieties, there are a lot that we don't and we would love to know  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:17):**  a little bit more about them. It's great to speak with Farmerama and people on the other  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:26):**  side of the world to let them know what we're doing and that on this side of the earth,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:34):**  there's a group of people and not just us. There's a whole bunch of people who are trying  
**[0:07:39-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:39):**  to take care of the land too and make it much better.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:53):**  Over the last 18 months, I've been working closely with the brilliant agroecologist and  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:07:57):**  systems thinker, Nicole Masters, to develop the Soil Mentor Regen platform. I haven't  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:04):**  really shared before on Farmerama that I actually spend most of my working life in my role  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:09):**  as co-creator of VidaCycle. We develop apps to support people on their regenerative farming  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:15):**  journey. Originally, I started building the apps just for my family's farm in Chile. We  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:22):**  have one for trees, one for helping to manage in the vineyards, and then also Soil Mentor,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:28):**  which helps with soil health. But then the neighbors started using these apps and it's  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:34):**  all grown from there. The Soil Mentor Regen platform is our latest tool. It builds on  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:40):**  the power of in-field observations and it combines those observations with regenerative  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:46):**  benchmarks as well as explanations and potential questions or actions you might want to consider.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:53):**  It's basically bringing some of the wisdom and experience of Nicole and her team to help  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:08:58):**  you understand what you're seeing in the field. Getting little tips from Nicole to understand  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:05):**  what your earthworm count means is actually really helpful.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:09):**  I wanted to ask you a bit about, you have a strong focus on the monitoring and particularly  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:14):**  through observation and digging holes. Could you tell me a little bit about how did that  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:18):**  come about and why and maybe some examples? I don't know.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:22):**  It often blows me away that our biggest resource and our biggest investment is land and soil.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:28):**  Yet, when people buy land, I know very few that have dug holes. It's something that I  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:35):**  did the first time I brought my own land, is dug a hole and found a huge disaster. Six  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:42):**  inches down, we had a calcium silicate plate, basically. It had blown over from the volcanic  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:49):**  region. You can use that calcium silicate to quick set concrete. It was basically a  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:09:54):**  concretion layer. I was like, oh, this is cool. That is such a cool challenge to have.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:02):**  I think year four or five of owning the property, I was like, this was so stupid. What was I  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:07):**  thinking? By year seven, we had totally broken through that hard pan, not using a ripper,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:16):**  not using any mechanical interventions, just using grazing, biostimulants, and diverse  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:22):**  plant species. Those three things cracked through a hard pan that the neighbors could  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:27):**  not get through with a ripper. They couldn't even get through with a single tine on a ripper.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:32):**  For me, digging those holes and observing how, if you set the scene, we can overcome  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:38):**  so many challenges. What I find is people are often pretty good at looking above ground  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:43):**  and looking at pasture or looking at crops, but they're not digging holes because that's  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:48):**  where the pre-warning system is coming in. That's what's going to let you know that actually  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:53):**  there is compaction starting to form. The biggest limitation to yield, production, health,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:10:58):**  and profit is compaction, is the amount of airflow and gas exchange that you have in  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:03):**  the soil. If you're not even digging a hole, you're missing that whole signal that that  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:08):**  soil is basically saying to you, hey buddy, we need to really shift what we're doing here.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:13):**  I find digging holes can be one of the most powerful things we can do, especially if we  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:17):**  dig a hole in the middle of a field and then dig a hole underneath a fence line. That can  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:23):**  be a huge emotional impact for somebody who's like, whoa, did I create this? The answer  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:29):**  is yes, you did. This is a soil that's lost all its aggregate structure, all its carbon,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:35):**  all its life. Sometimes those impacts are the best thing for us. It's a bit of a shock  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:40):**  and then it's like, okay, cool. All right, now what do I do? Let's get into action. I  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:45):**  think if there's one thing that anyone needs to do on their own property, it's dig a hole.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:51):**  Working together over the last two years or so, you and the Integrity Soils team have  
**[0:11:56-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:11:56):**  brought together the 10 Regen Indicators, which are an amazing way to kind of, whilst  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:05):**  you're looking at the soil, to take specific readings and then start to monitor and learn  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:10):**  how things are changing. Maybe you could tell me a little bit about the Regen Indicators  
**[0:12:14-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:14):**  and why you chose them, those 10, and then we could pick maybe one or two of your favorites.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:23):**  I think when I first met Abby and the Vetus Cycle team, there was this challenge, right?  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:28):**  If we could narrow down all the indicators. I came to Abby with what was our existing  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:33):**  consulting platform to try and make it more workable for us. It is very in-depth. It has  
**[0:12:40-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:40):**  a huge number of indicators. I like it, but then I'm a geek, right? But for producers,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:48):**  it was actually off-putting because here's this huge list and array of different types  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:53):**  of measures for soil and plant health, and actually it became a barrier because now we  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:12:58):**  have too many things that we're measuring. The challenge was if we had to distill that  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:02):**  down to 10 of your favorite children, who would they be? Which was very mean, but very,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:09):**  very, very helpful in terms of, okay, well actually a lot of these indicators are interrelated  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:13):**  and interlinked. Some of them are more related to other factors. If we could narrow down  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:19):**  just 10 of those, what would they look like? I'm really, really excited about what we've  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:26):**  put together. I'm really proud of it. I think it simplifies that soil assessment process.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:33):**  It's not every single thing we can do to assess soil health, but they are some of the most  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:37):**  powerful indicators. If I was to use something like aggregate stability, how does a crumb  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:43):**  of soil hold itself together? That can tell you so much about what's happening with water.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:48):**  It can tell you so much about air movement. It can tell you so much about soil losses.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:54):**  What I find is most producers don't realize how much soil they're losing. It continues  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:13:58):**  to be our biggest export in the world. I think you guys lose about five tons an acre roughly  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:05):**  of soil losses in the UK. You might have to check that. Those soil losses are often happening  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:11):**  unseen. It's from underneath your feet that you get water moving through that profile  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:18):**  and it actually takes soil with it. You can often see it when there's a heavy rainfall  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:21):**  event. You'll see your rivers will be like a muddy color. Then what we're seeing here  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:27):**  in the US right now are massive, massive dust storms. The dust storm that went all the way  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:32):**  through Canada, all the way down to Kansas, these huge dust storms. By doing an aggregate  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:38):**  stability test, it actually tells us what is happening with pore spaces, so can air  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:43):**  and water move through that? What holds those soils together is microbiology. It's a pretty  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:48):**  good indicator that you've got microbes active because as they move through the soil, they're  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:54):**  releasing like poos and wheeze and vomit and spit and all that stuff that holds the soil  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:14:59):**  together. That's what gives you stability. When we have degraded our microbial community,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:06):**  then there aren't those sticky substances. Then when soil comes into a little crumb or  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:12):**  a little aggregate, it rushes into those pore spaces and that soil collapses. It just turns  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:18):**  into a little piece of muck and then that's more likely to wash away or blow away. That's  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:23):**  one indicator that I really like because it does tell us so much and there's a definite  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:28):**  link between aggregate stability and yield. The less stability we have, then the less  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:33):**  yield potential you're going to have. I think too, we focus in on the micro and that reflects  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:41):**  the macro. It's like just from that tiniest particle, we can tell so much about a soil.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:47):**  It's all interlinked with those other 10 indicators. By itself, it doesn't mean as much until you  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:53):**  start to bring all of those pieces together. That's really exciting for me because often  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:15:57):**  I get quite saddened by the whole carbon credit movement and this focus just on organic matter  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:04):**  or soil organic carbon. What I think is really exciting about the Regen indicators is that  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:10):**  it really does bridge that complexity or it brings you the oversight of so many different  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:17):**  things all in one place. I think keeping that complexity whilst also making it doable for  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:24):**  producers is where we're trying to play, I guess.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:30):**  Yeah. We're seeing the soil carbon gold rush all over the world and anytime we focus just  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:37):**  on purely on one aspect in complex systems, there's the potential for some negative outcomes,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:44):**  whatever that might be. There's ways to cheat carbon tests. There's ways to just focus in  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:51):**  on that part and that doesn't tell us if it's functional or not. That's what we're interested  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:16:56):**  in is the functionality of soil processes. You can have really high organic matter and  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:02):**  be on peat. That doesn't mean that that carbon is highly functional or of benefit. We need  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:09):**  to be thinking in whole systems and we need to be doing that for climate mitigation, animal  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:15):**  health, the whole thing instead of just looking at disparate parts that has never worked in  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:20):**  the past and it's not going to work in the future.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:24):**  From the tests themselves, we then work together to build the actual Soil Mentor Regen platform.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:32):**  That's something that at VitaCycle, when you first approached us, we didn't know it was  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:37):**  on the cards, but that's where we've got to, which is really exciting to work together  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:41):**  on that. Very much the idea is to then have across those 10 indicators, you can see a  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:48):**  benchmark of red, amber or green for your biome, rainfall and soil type. How good is  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:17:55):**  your earthworm count, for example, compared to expectations, but then also compared to  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:01):**  other farmers who are on the platform in a similar situation to you?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:08):**  One of the things I find very exciting about the platform is there is lots of monitoring  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:12):**  tools that we can use. There are other pieces of software that will give us this reading,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:19):**  whatever. It's a benchmarking. What we go above and beyond on is here are these indicators,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:27):**  is this good, bad or ugly, but then what does that potentially mean? What are we seeing?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:32):**  Why would that indicator perhaps look like that? Then most excitedly, what are some of  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:38):**  the things we could start to consider to do? It's not a prescription. It's not going to  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:43):**  be, hey, you need 250 kilos. That's not what this app is designed to do, but it's designed  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:50):**  to help build your own observation skills so that you can start to take some different  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:18:56):**  actions or reflect on why is this particular indicator performing so poorly? Because all  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:01):**  of it's going to relate to your goals. If that is profitability or performance or health,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:07):**  all of this comes back to the soil metrics. What I like about it is by being able to see,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:13):**  am I actually in the green here? I'm doing really, really well with this indicator, but  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:18):**  then other indicators are not doing so well or not doing very well compared to my cohort  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:23):**  or other people in that biome. For me, I don't know, I find most producers are pretty competitive.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:29):**  We do have this competitive nature. Being able to see what other measures might be for  
**[0:19:35-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:35):**  our biome and our soil type is so powerful. We can go actually on average, people might  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:43):**  have this many earthworms or on average, we're seeing this many insect pests. What might  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:49):**  be helpful is you can take a look and see actually a lot of people are having these  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:19:54):**  insect pests as well. That doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels, but it helps to  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:00):**  feel like I'm not alone as well in having some of these issues. There's a whole lot  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:05):**  of things that I could be doing.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:07):**  Yeah, I totally agree with that, that being able to move from that in-field observation  
**[0:20:12-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:12):**  to some understanding of where you sit compared to expectations to then have an idea of, okay,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:21):**  what might you consider at this moment in time to then do in response to whatever your  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:27):**  soil is telling you through these indicators. Just bringing those together feels really  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:33):**  exciting and obviously, I still think that conversation is required. That's something  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:39):**  that we've been really clear on and I know you're clear on. It's not that the platform  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:43):**  will provide you with all of the answers and you just have to go and apply something that  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:47):**  it says. It's all about, here's a way to help you move to the next level in your questioning  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:20:56):**  and conversations and whether that further investigation is with your community or with  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:03):**  a coach or with just with your farming team, whoever it is. In my experience of being on  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:11):**  the farm, I've really noticed that having sole responsibility for some of the decisions,  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:18):**  it just isn't very healthy, I don't think, in the end.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:21):**  Yeah, and I think the cool thing is that as many people on your team can all be tying  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:28):**  into that information, they can be adding things that they're observing. What I'm finding  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:33):**  is it's getting some of the managers and some of the people on the ground connected in a  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:38):**  different way and then being able to share some of those insights. I think that's a really,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:44):**  really important outcome is that everybody can have it on their phone and then share  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:48):**  that and then sharing it within hubs. We're seeing farmer groups and hubs signing up and  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:21:56):**  then being able to share that with each other, I think is so powerful because we're all learning  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:01):**  and it is a journey and part of it is being willing to be transparent and authentic about  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:07):**  some of these aspects and go, hey, you know what? This is not working as well as I thought  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:12):**  it was. What do you guys think? What do you think is going on? Having that hive mind to  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:17):**  troubleshoot, I think is so powerful. My early days of learning happened through hubs like  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:23):**  that and I think that they are the most powerful tool. I think they're more powerful than going  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:29):**  to university or anything like that. It's actually being able to work through ideas  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:34):**  and what people are seeing and do that as a collective. Then it stops, especially if  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:40):**  you're by yourself, you're trialing all these different things and another season has passed.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:46):**  Whereas if you can collectively trial and work through things, we're going to speed  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:51):**  up that transition to incredibly healthy, vibrant ecosystems, which I believe we all  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:57):**  want. It is our life support system.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:22:59):**  Okay, great. Is there anything else that you would like to share or communicate to the  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:04):**  farmerama community or anything we missed?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:06):**  I wonder if we just share a little bit about like data is theirs, I think is important.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:12):**  What happens with all that material and how it's becoming one of the most valuable commodities  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:17):**  and actually it's theirs. It's not somebody else's.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:21):**  That's core fundamental belief at VitaCycle and I think also at Integrity Soils is that  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:29):**  any information that's collected about your farm or that you collect on your farm is your  
**[0:23:35-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:35):**  information and your data and you own it. We're here to support you in learning from  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:44):**  your data. We're not here to use your data for other means. That's always been really  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:49):**  clear and we have a data policy, which you can easily read online.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:23:56):**  When we first met Nicole, I shared with you the feminine business principles at the time  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:01):**  and you encouraged me to move them forward and they're now the regenerative business  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:07):**  principles that we operate from at VitaCycle. I think that it's like all this data is great,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:15):**  but also and moving soil health forward is super important, but actually reflecting that  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:20):**  in the business and what we're committed to as people, talking about mindset shifts, that's  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:26):**  also a really important piece of the puzzle. To me, the data policy is super important  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:32):**  alongside how we operate and that we build regenerative into everything that we do.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:38):**  That's what attracted us to you is we want to see like-minded businesses that really  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:44):**  do see how do we regenerate businesses, how do we regenerate farm businesses and that  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:50):**  it doesn't happen through an extraction model. That's not happening by trying to pull the  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:24:55):**  wool over farmers' eyes, you know, and I could see that you guys had a really similar ethic  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:00):**  to where we were coming from, so it felt like a very good, exciting, natural fit.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:05):**  I'm very proud that we've created the Soil Mentor Regen platform. We're already supporting  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:10):**  about 100 farmers on a regenerative transition program in Southern Europe. We work with groups  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:15):**  in Australia, some key brands in the UK, as well as working with committed individual  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:21):**  farmers. Really, the main aim is to support producers to go out and use their infield  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:26):**  observations as their compass. If you want to hear more about this work, then it's best  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:32):**  to head to our website, soils.Vedacycle.com, and you can get in touch there.

**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:46):**  whisky in tune with the land, inspired by an approach often more associated with winemaking.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:52):**  The Bruclady distillery was originally founded in 1881, but after closing was resurrected  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:25:58):**  in 2001 by co-founders who were keen to explore the idea of terroir. They were so familiar  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:04):**  with in their previous line of work making wine, the distillery focuses on provenance,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:09):**  traceability, sustainability and transparency.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:12):**  First, the farmer. Richard works in Wiltshire. He grew up on farms, but only became a farmer  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:19):**  himself in the early 1990s, where he says he saw the soil deteriorate before his eyes,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:26):**  which spurred him to grow organically and biodynamically. His barley has been used to  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:31):**  produce Bruclady's first ever biodynamic whisky, launched at the end of last year.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:36):**  I love the connection, the direct connection between us, you know, our love for the soil  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:48):**  and the plants that grow in the soil and the organisms that are there, and then the quality  
**[0:26:54-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:26:54):**  that that then passes on to the products, the grains. Then that is appreciated by Bruclady  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:03):**  because they're taking it directly from the farmer and there's that connection. I love  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:09):**  that story, you know, that we can talk about what we're doing in our fields and they're  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:15):**  receiving it at the other end and they're seeing how that develops in flavour and taste,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:22):**  but also in the yield of the whisky at the end, which is often being talked about by  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:28):**  their head distiller there. So I just love that constant connection, which I think is  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:35):**  rare these days in farming. But I hope with the changing in how farming is being supported,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:43):**  I hope those sorts of connections are going to develop more and more.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:47):**  In about 2009, I guess, we were approached to grow biodynamic barley. We were working  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:27:57):**  biodynamically at the time, but we weren't growing barley. We had grown malting barley  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:01):**  before conventionally and we were asked, could we grow biodynamic barley for Bruclady? And  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:07):**  they said, yeah, we'd love to. But they'd come across biodynamic wines and were interested  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:12):**  to see whether those sort of reasons that people were buying and growing biodynamic  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:17):**  wines could be transferred to whisky. So that's why we got involved and we're very excited  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:24):**  to be involved since then. So our first crop was grown in 2010 and the first whisky was  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:31):**  distilled in 2011. It's so exciting. And it also came together around the COP26, which  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:38):**  is probably in everyone's distant memory now, but it was lovely that the first whisky that  
**[0:28:45-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:45):**  was bottled after 10 years of working relationship came out around this hiatus of talking about  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:28:56):**  global carbon. So it was lovely that we could produce something with a real depth, not only  
**[0:29:03-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:03):**  of flavor, but also of responsibility to farm, soil and planet and have all the evidence  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:12):**  that was needed to back that up and go with it.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:17):**  Christy McFarlane's been with Bruclady for the last six years and in whisky for a lot  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:22):**  longer. She speaks about the important connection between whisky and farming and about some  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:27):**  of the work Bruclady has been doing with a type of barley called bear grown in Orkney.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:32):**  Bear is a landrace, which means that it's become adapted over many years to the climate,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:38):**  soil and landscape of the place where it's grown. In this case, that's the Western and  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:43):**  Northern Scottish islands. There's evidence that bear has been grown in Scotland going  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:48):**  back all the way to the eighth century and Bruclady have been collaborating with the  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:52):**  University of the Highlands and Islands to distill a modern whisky from this ancient  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:57):**  grain.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:29:58):**  It's really important to us to have a direct connection with our farming partners and to  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:03):**  kind of share in the risk and help to create viable business systems, so making sure that  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:09):**  they've got a market for their crop. Bear barley that we've grown on Islay for a couple  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:17):**  of seasons started in 2005 and then eventually was taken up to Orkney. So in partnership  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:25):**  with the University of the Highlands and Islands Agronomy Institute in Orkney, we've been growing  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:29):**  bear and successfully distilling bear barley for a number of years. It really bears the  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:36):**  only landrace that we work with, but it's all come from a curiosity of flavour and a  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:41):**  pursuit of flavour and just finding diversity and nuance in whisky production.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:47):**  So yeah, we've been working for a while with the team up there. Bear is a really fascinating  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:30:53):**  grain. It's a six-row grain instead of a two-row grain and it just has amazing flavour qualities  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:00):**  for us. So you get a really unctuous, creamy texture in the whisky and there's some benefits  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:06):**  to farmers as well, like it thrives in nutrient-poor soil conditions and has a very long straw,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:13):**  which is of benefit to farmers using it for cattle bedding and the like. It also thrives  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:19):**  in a short growing season, so up in the northern latitudes of Orkney it works really well for  
**[0:31:25-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:25):**  their long, light summers. So yeah, fascinating grain and just a small part of a really interesting  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:34):**  and infinite barley journey that Brucladdy's been on for two decades now.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:41):**  We've come on quite a far journey or a long journey so far. For us it is just about connection  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:47):**  and it's about supporting the entire supply chain and the entire ecosystem. So as we move  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:31:53):**  forward as a planet that needs to be more sustainable, it's about making sure that everybody  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:00):**  is supported and that the right kind of business decisions are being made across the whole  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:04):**  chain, whether that's from barley growing to malting to distilling and then the products  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:10):**  that we put in front of people. So biodynamic is a massive step forward for us and a whisky  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:16):**  for the future. Not only is it delicious, not only are we connected directly with the  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:22):**  farmer, but as Richard said, it's carbon sequestering from a farm that sequesters 10 times more  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:28):**  carbon than it emits. So it's those sorts of connections that we need to really master  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:34):**  and that all businesses need to look a little bit further at what they're doing and do more  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:40):**  for all the communities that they work with.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:46):**  I didn't used to drink whisky actually. Now, yeah, I definitely enjoy having a drink last  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:32:53):**  night actually. I mean, I would describe it as velvety and it's that sort of smoothness  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:33:01):**  that I like that I probably didn't see in other whiskies, which in the past, and velvety  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:33:07):**  is also a word that's been used to describe our crops as well and how they grow. So it's  
**[0:33:13-0:33:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey#t=0:33:13):**  a lovely connection in that way.

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:00:00):**  I think ultimately we have to get the general public on board with thinking about these  systems from a deeper holistic place.  The thing that I'm most passionate about is getting people to understand the scale of  
**[0:00:12-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:00:12):**  the system and the weight of their decisions.  How do we change anything when the solution is to dump our excessive clothing waste on  non-white people in the global south to the point where it pollutes the land and the sea?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:00:26):**  I need people to understand that it isn't particularly on this group or that group,  that it's on all of us because at the end of the day we are the ones buying the clothing.  It's never just a five dollar dress.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:00:38):**  It represents exploitation, pollution of the environment, and a system which further harms  marginalized people.  Regenerative systems and textile systems like Fibershed, they aren't just good for the planet,  
**[0:00:52-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:00:52):**  but ultimately they're good for people.  Domestic textile production in the UK is practically non-existent and in getting away from understanding  the importance of how things are made, we've truly done a disservice to ourselves and to  
**[0:01:09-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:01:09):**  future generations where we could have this amazing system which provides jobs and a healthier  environment.  My name is Aja Barber and I am the author of the book Consume the Need for Collective  
**[0:01:27-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:01:27):**  Change, Colonialism, Climate Change and Consumerism.  In building our regional networks of fiber and dye farmers, processors, mills and designers,  Fibersheds across the world are showing that it is possible to produce high quality and  
**[0:01:47-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:01:47):**  profitable fibers and dyes within nature beneficial systems.  The problem is that the connection between farming and fashion has been lost.  In this series we'll be exploring the challenges that farmers and processors face as well as  
**[0:02:01-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:02:01):**  the experiences and needs of designers and we'll also dig into what a regenerative fashion  system could look like by hearing from those already pioneering the path across the British  Isles.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:02:16):**  So far in this series we've heard from the farmers and fiber producers and also the people  who are developing infrastructure for processing it into yarns.  In this final episode of the series we talk to three independent designers who work with  
**[0:02:30-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:02:30):**  native natural fibers and dyes and who are pioneering a shift towards a new form of fashion.  While they don't claim to be fully regenerative, they are transparent and open about their  approaches to becoming more so and they take a deep thoughtful approach to making small  
**[0:02:46-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:02:46):**  steps in the right direction.  Next here's Tilly Kay of Zero to Product, a design studio offering design and development  services to the fashion industry.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:02:56):**  So I'm interested in deepening the understanding of our wardrobes and their connection to the  natural world and all of those processes in between.  I always wanted to be a fashion designer but I also remember from a very early age being  
**[0:03:13-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:03:13):**  incredibly conscious that I only wanted to do it if it was in a sustainable way.  I'm Tilly Kay, I'm a designer.  I'm exploring the balance between my desire to develop my ideas into products with my  
**[0:03:37-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:03:37):**  awareness of an industry that's grossly overproducing by focusing my attention wholeheartedly on  materials and practices that I consider to be in closer harmony with the earth and what  it can sustain.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:03:53):**  I work freelance with small businesses and independent designers helping to develop their  products and do sampling and pattern cutting and designing whilst helping them make more  sustainable choices in materials or production methods.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:04:13):**  Under the trading name Zero to Product I'm also currently developing a collection of  linen shirts.  My grandfather was a farmer, he had a biodynamic farm in Wexford in Ireland, it was called  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:04:30):**  Inish Glass.  So this farm to me was glorious and seemed huge and unending and so rich and full of  different types of life and growth.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:04:38):**  It was a very immersive experience with the land at a young age.  Back wool is my favourite material to work with, like a woven wool.  I love sewing with it, it's just so pleasing, you can mould it, you can sculpt it to be  
**[0:04:57-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:04:57):**  what you want it to be.  So if I'm not looking for a winter coat then my next go-to would be linen or hemp.  I'm especially interested in the fact that they can grow quite easily in our climate.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:05:12):**  As far as I'm aware the only thing holding us back from producing more UK or European  made linen and hemp material is the processing machinery required, especially to make it  fine enough for fashion use.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:05:27):**  There is a definite growing awareness of the benefits of the use of home grown fibres but  there's still this mood in the fashion industry of driving down the price from your supplier.  It shocks me that material is so cheap, you think about the amount of work and time and  
**[0:05:47-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:05:47):**  space that is required to produce this cotton or linen or whatever the material, however  high the yield, it's still such an enormous effort and we're treating it like a throwaway  product.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:06:02):**  It's not surprising if you think that especially the cotton industry was founded on slavery  so the price of it for a long time has been influenced by the fact it was based on free  labour.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:06:14):**  So the amount of actual labour it takes to produce material was not really accounted  for in the price of it and now that we barely pay people, I mean in some cases people are  paid, in other cases people are not properly paid for the work still, so it's not factoring  
**[0:06:31-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:06:31):**  in the amount of actual labour required to produce the material.  So I think a huge shift is needed to see the actual value of these products.  When we talk about models like Fibershed or projects around the UK that are really trying  
**[0:06:47-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:06:47):**  to focus on home grown materials like the Bristol cloth project and the price has to  be high but I think it only feels so shockingly high because the rest, what we're used to,  is so undervalued.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:07:01):**  So the Fibershed model which is based on the idea of having more regional textile systems  means that you're able to see all of those processes that go from that original raw material  right through to the finished product.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:07:17):**  They're all more local and they're more visible so I think it really helps foster that understanding  of the value and work that's gone into every piece of clothing.  There's a potential for Fibershed to help designers like myself to better understand  
**[0:07:34-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:07:34):**  where their materials are actually coming from and that direct link back to agriculture.  I was lucky enough to go to a farm that's part of the South East Fibershed and we did  a tour around the farm and we looked at the dye garden project that they're setting up  
**[0:07:52-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:07:52):**  and met the sheep who are going to be part of a flock to hopefully produce some wool  to make jumpers.  It was a visit that really shows that immediate connection between our clothing and farming.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:08:09):**  The Fibershed is a soil to soil textile system and I feel very strongly that we should make  our clothes 100% biodegradable so that means thinking about the thread and it means thinking  about the buttons and the fusing as well which if it's 100% biodegradable it means really  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:08:30):**  you can't have any traditional fusing in it either.  Fusing is that plasticky, often non-woven interlining that has a sticky, gluey surface  on it.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:08:39):**  It actually is a bit harder to give clothes that sharp, fashiony look that we've come  to expect without using some plastics or synthetics along the way.  So it's very interesting to explore that further and see what else you can use instead of synthetic  
**[0:08:55-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:08:55):**  materials in the trimmings.  It's easy to focus on just the main fabric of the garment but there are all of those  little things that go into it as well.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:09:04):**  I really think that that is a helpful model of thinking about the end of life of a garment  and is it able to degrade back into the soil without leaving toxins from the dyes if their  chemical dyes or without leaving any plastic residue from a polyester thread or from a  
**[0:09:23-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:09:23):**  fused interlining.  My grandfather took five years to turn the farm that he took on into a healthy biodynamic  farm.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:09:35):**  I feel like I really understand that delicate balance that the soil needs to continue to  do its job and richly produce and produce.  It's now becoming a lot more common to talk about regenerative agriculture in fashion  
**[0:09:49-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:09:49):**  and not just food systems.  I would like to see that spread a lot further in the fashion industry and in how we produce  materials, the idea that it's got to be regenerative but also really digging into the idea of what  
**[0:10:01-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:10:01):**  is regenerative and making sure it's not just becoming a catchall term.  Textiles and clothing are undervalued and that's a real challenge for the industry to  correct and so is the endemic exploitation of people and natural environments that paved  
**[0:10:16-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:10:16):**  the way for the monster production system that we are faced with today.  If we reflect on the centuries of injustice and harm that have been inflicted on people  in this industry it's clear that we have to integrate a social awareness into future models  
**[0:10:29-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:10:29):**  for fashion, not just an environmental one.  We need a model that aims to decolonise as much as it aims to detoxify the materials  and practices being used.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:10:41):**  The discussions that we and others are having about what our clothing is made from and where  and how natural fibres are grown represents a huge leap forward both in industry and consumer  consciousness.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:10:54):**  I think it's interesting how the conversation around dye and colour is often secondary to  that of fibres and fashion, a topic which itself usually comes behind food.  I've sat through so many events or discussions about food sustainability and sovereignty,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:11:09):**  wondering why we aren't having the same level of discussions about textiles and clothing.  And now that is starting to happen I wonder the same about colours and dyes.  One great initiative worth drawing attention to is the Dyer's Circle, a sharing platform  
**[0:11:23-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:11:23):**  comprising people who are committed to transitioning the industry away from synthetic dyes.  Debra Barker has worked with natural dyes for 15 years and is also the regional coordinator  for the South East England Fibreshed, as well as a co-producer and primary researcher for  
**[0:11:39-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:11:39):**  this series.  Natural dyeing is not new, it's something that we've been doing for thousands of years.  There were some scraps of blue cotton dyed with indigo discovered by archaeologists in  
**[0:11:51-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:11:51):**  Peru in 2016 and they're estimated to be six and a half thousand years old.  For thousands of years we've dyed our clothes with biodegradable dye stuffs like plants  and insects and lichens, mushrooms, right up until the mid-19th century when synthetic  
**[0:12:08-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:12:08):**  dyes were developed.  Just 170 years later, 99% of our clothes are coloured with synthetic dyes, whether the  clothes are made from natural fibres or from synthetic fibres.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:12:21):**  Synthetic dyes are made from crude oil which, unlike plants and insects, doesn't biodegrade  and there are hot acidic cocktails of synthetic endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic dye  chemicals regularly emptied into our water systems.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:12:35):**  It now accounts for up to 20% of our global water pollution.  My name's Debra Barker, I'm co-founder and director of the South East England Fibreshed  and I run a small natural dye studio collaborating with artists and designers alongside my work  
**[0:12:52-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:12:52):**  with farmers in regenerative agriculture.  I also grow small-scale dye plants.  In the UK there are three dye plants that will grow well.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:13:02):**  There's Weld for yellow, Madder for red and Woad for blue.  And there are also lots of other plants and shrubs and trees as well as waste material  from food and forestry and farming that's being researched.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:13:15):**  And they can all be used to create a biodegradable palette.  It does mean rethinking how we work with and value colour, but I think that's a really  exciting invitation to find a place-based relationship with colour and the landscape  
**[0:13:30-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:13:30):**  that it produces.  Over the past three years there's been a growing interest from designers wanting to work with  natural dyes, particularly regionally grown agro-ecological dyes from people who are interested  
**[0:13:46-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:13:46):**  in making products within a fibreshed and a source of soil model.  It's partly inspired by what's happening in the USA Fibreshed.  There's a dawning realisation that every metre of dyed cloth represents square metres  
**[0:13:58-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:13:58):**  of farmland and you can choose cloth that furthers harm or you can buy cloth that supports  farmers who are paid a living wage and are actively working to improve soil health, sequester  carbon and support nature restoration and biodiversity.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:14:14):**  Despite the interest that designers are showing in naturally dyed fabric, there are no commercially  available dye plants in the UK that I'm aware of at the moment.  There's lots of dye plants being grown on allotments and in gardens and some grown on  
**[0:14:30-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:14:30):**  farms but therefore farmers who are using them in their own products.  In the 1980s there was a big EU research project into natural dye crops and several farms in  the UK were involved including the farmers Ian and Bernadette Howard who set up the Wode  
**[0:14:51-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:14:51):**  Centre in Norfolk.  They're now retired but they are advising on several dye projects which are in the early  stages including Homegrown Homespun which is a community clothing project in the north  
**[0:15:05-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:15:05):**  of England Fibershed and they're growing Wode on a large scale to dye the flax that they're  growing.  We're also hoping that they're going to advise on field trials of weld to be grown as a cover  
**[0:15:18-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:15:18):**  crop with barley that we're growing in the south east of England Fibershed.  The project which we ran to trial growing dye plants on a commercial scale and to understand  some of the challenges we worked with three farms, two mixed farms and a small horticulture  
**[0:15:35-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:15:35):**  farm all committed to working agroecologically.  There were two main findings from the trial.  The first was the need for equipment for harvesting and processing and this is a problem that  
**[0:15:52-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:15:52):**  is common to all the countries who have offshored all their textile production so USA, Europe,  Australia but there are lots of people around the world working on open source designs to  develop harvesting and processing equipment.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:16:08):**  Another useful source of information is the Dias Circle which was a platform set up in  2020 by academic and colourist Jackie Andrews and she's brought together natural dyers,  historians and conservators and archaeologists from all around the world who are really generously  
**[0:16:25-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:16:25):**  sharing their knowledge and experience with people who are committed to creating colour  without using petrochemicals.  The other main learning from our pilot is that we can't expect farmers in the climate  
**[0:16:39-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:16:39):**  crisis to carry all the risk for growing a new crop.  One of our farms twice lost all their seed beds in violent storms.  We're working up ideas for a project to encourage studios to invest collectively in a dye crop  
**[0:16:56-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:16:56):**  with a farmer.  This is a really important step.  It will help spread the risk financially between the farmer and the studios and there are precedents  
**[0:17:07-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:17:07):**  that we can draw in community supported agriculture.  These more collaborative ways of working through supply networks rather than operating in a  vacuum in a large global supply chain are going to be essential if we're going to create  
**[0:17:21-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:17:21):**  economic systems that support and enhance our communities and the land.  We've got a distorted view of the true cost of producing colour.  There's a really long history of exploitation.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:17:32):**  The indigo trade in the 18th century is based on indigenous knowledge and enslaved labour  and apart from a handful of ethical brands, the colour in our clothes is always at the  expense of people and ecosystems, often in the global south.  
**[0:17:48-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:17:48):**  I'm often asked how we're going to scale up and my response is why would we want to?  We absolutely can't afford to.  We're grossly overproducing clothes for the UK which has resulted in mountains and mountains  
**[0:18:02-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:18:02):**  of hazardous waste being exported abroad and the resources we're using each year for fashion  are way beyond what the earth can regenerate in a year.  So if we want future generations and even ourselves to have a healthy future, we have  
**[0:18:15-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:18:15):**  to transition from our current extractive model and commit to working within planetary  boundaries and in restoring our ecosystems.  To the people who say that the risk of changing the system is too great a threat, my response  
**[0:18:28-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:18:28):**  is that the risk of not changing is even greater because if we don't act and don't stop taking  oil out of the ground, the severity of the climate crisis will make it impossible for  us to grow anything at all.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:18:39):**  Phoebe English is another leading UK designer who, through her connection with the South  East England Fibershed and Plough Hatch Farm, is also now on a journey to rethinking how  her brand designs and produces fashion.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:18:57):**  The fashion industry as it is running now at the scale and the speed that it's running  in at the moment, won't be able to continue in this way.  We need to be preparing our knowledge base and our skills bases and our practices in  
**[0:19:13-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:19:13):**  preparation for that and to also not only mitigate but to try and come back from that  as urgently as we can.  I really believe every action that we partake in goes towards a negative or less negative  
**[0:19:32-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:19:32):**  or a positive path for the future and we can do that in our home lives and we can certainly  do that in our design activities and in our business activities.  Fibershed offers a model where all of those things are covered, where we can be working  
**[0:19:51-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:19:51):**  in a replenishing and enhancing way because it literally takes you from the source to  the destination, the soil being the source and the soil being the destination and then  all the multitude of other elements that are affected along the way are all taken into  
**[0:20:08-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:20:08):**  account and preserved and enhanced and respected.  We've been running the business in the way that we inherited fashion businesses and we've  replicated those systems but over the last four to five years we've been re-evaluating  
**[0:20:28-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:20:28):**  those systems and structures and trying to implement different ones such as production  of waste, the reuse of waste, reducing our garment miles as much as we can and we've  been beginning to explore the chemical content of the clothing we were producing so we were  
**[0:20:52-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:20:52):**  beginning to look at natural dye which sort of brought us to the plant, the plant-based  area of design.  I sort of coincided with a time in my life where I was able to interact with the soil  
**[0:21:07-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:21:07):**  and interact with growth and natural systems and natural processes for the first time and  it was a natural progression that that needed to feed into my work as well.  I'm trying to understand how I could connect those two things, the urban business and urban  
**[0:21:31-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:21:31):**  existence with our natural systems.  So I'd begun to see that there was this potential because at the moment fashion and farming  are completely separated, we speak a different language.  
**[0:21:49-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:21:49):**  The concept that we're actually intrinsically linked to each other is completely missed  within fashion education and fashion knowledge and fashion systems especially but we are  intrinsically linked.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:22:03):**  The systems that we're linked to are so international and so complex and so you know have such a  myriad of processes and people and places in between them that there's just no point  where you come across each other.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:22:20):**  So being introduced to Fibershed, the concept of Fibershed was really exciting and we eventually  managed to attain some funding from the BFTT and we were able to reach out with this funding  to see if we could try and link our design activities to our natural local regional systems  
**[0:22:40-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:22:40):**  and produce some work together.  I've learnt a great deal from the process.  Myself and my team were coming into it with little to no knowledge and using the project  
**[0:22:52-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:22:52):**  as an action of education and of learning so the idea behind the project was to educate  ourselves and learn through doing and hoping that the action of practically trying to achieve  these things would help us understand a definition of what regenerative design could be.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:23:15):**  We came to visit Gala at Bloorhatch Farm and Deborah and to visit the Romney sheep.  That was quite a fundamentally important moment for me as a business owner and as a designer  and as a person to realise really how disconnected we are and have been to the fibre and to the  
**[0:23:40-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:23:40):**  soil that produces and the people that produce the fibres that we use.  So attaining that emotional connection was really important to me as part of this project.  The traditional ways of choosing a material would consist of going to a showroom or a  
**[0:24:00-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:24:00):**  big fabric fair and you'd rouse all of your fabrics stapled onto a bit of card and you'd  feel them and look at the price and then they'd send them back to the studio, the swatches  that you liked and then do a drawing and choose a swatch that might go on your drawing and  
**[0:24:16-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:24:16):**  then order the fabric through an email.  A few weeks later a roll arrives in the studio and you use the fabric on the roll and that's  really as much interaction that you would get in a traditional way of making clothes.  
**[0:24:34-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:24:34):**  So being able to actually be part of building a fibre supply network, finding a farmer,  finding a flock, finding spinners and dyers and being emotionally connected and intrinsically  linking those elements together into a supply network was such a very different process  
**[0:25:03-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:25:03):**  because it's longer, it requires a huge amount of research and communication and partnership  building but also allows you to really fully understand how your fibre is produced, where  it's come from.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:25:22):**  We were really trying to work with elements that were supporting biodiversity and water  health and soil health and be biodegradable and that were supporting rural businesses  with urban finances.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:25:37):**  When we're working with these types of fibres we need to be working with them in a different  way, not in terms of necessarily the shape or the style but presenting it to people in  a different way and supplying it to people at a different time that actually is in sync  
**[0:25:57-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:25:57):**  with and in respect to the systems that they have come from.  Thinking about the timeframes in a vastly different way than you would do in a traditional  fashion value system and timeframe has been I think one of the biggest things that we've  
**[0:26:13-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:26:13):**  begun to understand.  And also relish because it's so against the grain of what the fashion systems currently  are like where it's really about delivering quickly in speed and maybe we should be only  
**[0:26:26-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:26:26):**  presenting work around harvest festivals where you are actually sort of reaping and celebrating  your harvest.  Maybe that's something that's more fitting.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:26:37):**  So it's given us a lot to think about and reassess lots of different elements of how  we work as a design business and not only in terms of fibre and dye and things like  that, lots of other elements such as timeframes and language and knowledge.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:26:57):**  Once you know the knowledge you can't unknow the knowledge.  So for example when I was starting to learn about the realities of the raw materials that  we use as a fashion business and started to really understand how damaging some of them  
**[0:27:15-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:27:15):**  could be and how detrimental they could be to communities and to natural resources and  natural systems that those communities rely on.  It's not possible to not act on that knowledge.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:27:28):**  So now that we have this knowledge about the amazing possibilities of producing fibre in  a more regional and in an enormously more replenishing way, I think the challenge is  definitely time, funding, communication and language and having calls with farmers but  
**[0:27:50-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:27:50):**  maybe not really knowing what to be asking or what to be saying because of spending an  entire decade never speaking to any fibre producers before.  So there were plenty of challenges.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:28:05):**  I've been sort of vaguely embarrassed about how little I understood or knew but also knowing  it was a very healthy place to be at least trying to communicate.  There are many many gaps not only regionally but within the UK as a whole for fibre production  
**[0:28:26-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:28:26):**  and fibre growth and harvesting and yield.  There's not a huge movement of people growing fibre for fashion and for clothing and I'm  hoping that will change along the way because there's a huge opportunity there for growers  
**[0:28:47-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:28:47):**  and producers.  So I think it's really interesting that what we keep hearing again and again is how a connection  to land, whether that comes through family or friends or just a chance to visit a local  
**[0:29:01-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:29:01):**  farm, how that can end up being a really transformative experience for a designer and how they approach  their work.  It's no secret that working with animals or with plants can have a very grounding and  
**[0:29:12-0:29:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:29:12):**  therapeutic effect and this is the kind of experience or exchange that Fibershed is really  set up to facilitate more of.  Despite the many challenges I'm really daily heartened by the commitment and vision of  
**[0:29:33-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:29:33):**  the farmers and designers that I work with.  We've got the potential working with indigenous knowledge, the best of historical sources  and knowledge combined with the best of 21st century technologies such as renewable energy,  
**[0:29:50-0:30:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:29:50):**  rain harvesting and rebed water systems for cleaning and collecting water to create a  regional network of fibre and dye plant farmers, designers, makers, producing zero carbon garments  in a way that respects planetary boundaries, builds soil health and protects the health  
**[0:30:11-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:30:11):**  of biosphere.  It's so thrilling the thought of wearing clothes that you know have done so much positive  good in the making of them and look fabulous.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:30:22):**  If you drew on paper what the regional fibre network might look like, my hope is it would  resemble my chorizal fungi, a really diverse and complex web of symbiotic relationships.  This episode was co-produced by South East England and South West England Fibersheds  
**[0:30:46-0:30:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:30:46):**  with support from Farmerama Radio, edited by Hattie Frances Bell and funded by Necessity  and the A-Team Foundation.  The South West and South East Fibershed collaboration is now developing a toolkit for farming and  
**[0:30:59-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farming-fashion-part-3#t=0:30:59):**  fashion sectors to signpost best practices and resources for exploring what a regenerative  fibre and fashion system could look like, due to launch next year.

## 66: Ecosystem agriculture, the probiotic turn and regenerative flower growing  
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmer Armour.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:10):**  This month we're introduced to the importance of ecosystem architecture by a forest ecologist  
**[0:00:15-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:15):**  and wine grower.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:17):**  We hear from two researchers investigating a shift in how we understand our relationship  
**[0:00:21-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:21):**  with the natural world.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:23):**  From one where humans are in control to one where we work with other life forms and biological  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:29):**  processes to build human and ecosystem health.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:34):**  And we finish hearing one grower's experience of implementing regenerative techniques on  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:39):**  her flower farm.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:45):**  Mimi Castile is a farmer, ecologist and winemaker.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:49):**  Mimi studied forest science and spent many years working with forest ecologies before  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:54):**  returning to Oregon to set up Hopewell Farm and Vineyard.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:57):**  We asked Mimi why.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:00:59):**  She shares her thoughts on how she embraced redundancy and the importance of nurturing  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:03):**  whole ecosystem agriculture as part of regenerative farming.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:08):**  My name is Mimi Castile.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:10):**  I'm from Hopewell Vineyards in the Willamette Valley of Oregon in the United States.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:17):**  And I am a regenerative wine farmer, but I also grow other things like vegetables and  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:24):**  fruit crops and ideas.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:28):**  They have a little animal flock too.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:30):**  And so it's a nice little family farm.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:34):**  I actually, my background and my advanced degrees are in forest biology and systems  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:42):**  biology.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:43):**  So I thought I wanted to be a wildland ecologist researcher.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:49):**  And when I was doing that work outside, out of graduate school, it was very clear to me  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:01:55):**  that the gradual dissolution and the gradual weakening of those areas was exclusively due  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:01):**  to the surrounding privately held land basis.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:05):**  And it was very clear to me that the way we're doing agriculture is what's threatening the  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:10):**  last of our wild areas.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:12):**  And having grown up on a vineyard, I made a choice to go to where I thought the front  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:21):**  lines were, would try to change agriculture from the inside.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:24):**  So I went back to farming and winemaking and that was back in 2005.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:32):**  So it's been almost 20 years and eventually started my own project and my own farm.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:37):**  But it was really to explore the ideas that were in my head about how we could build systems  
**[0:02:44-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:44):**  that make permeable barriers between our farms and our native ecosystems and allow for greater  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:53):**  flow and greater strength and resilience.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:02:59):**  Biological systems want to have redundant features.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:03):**  If you think about, you know, even our own bodies, we have a lot of especially bilateral  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:09):**  redundancy.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:10):**  So you don't have one eye, you have two, because if one eye gets hit with a rock, you have  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:15):**  another eye that can help you get around.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:19):**  And the same is true in all biological systems, they are constantly being challenged and creating  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:24):**  redundant pathways for those processes to continue.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:29):**  And in the simplification of the landscape, in order to do agriculture the way that we  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:33):**  think it's most efficient to produce one crop, even with good agricultural practices, we're  
**[0:03:40-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:40):**  missing out on a whole slew of pathways for energy to enter and exit our farm.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:03:54):**  Here there would definitely have been trees on the landscape and agriculture has largely  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:01):**  in, you know, in the conversion process, removed trees to make space for crops.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:07):**  Those trees functionally on the landscape are more than just carbon storage mechanisms.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:12):**  They are habitat in and of themselves, but they also are physical pumps taking both water  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:21):**  and micronutrients from deep, deep layers in the soil, pushing them into the leaves,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:27):**  trapping them in the leaves.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:29):**  Some of those leaves fall down and that's how the cycling of deep micronutrients is  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:35):**  facilitated on a natural landscape.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:39):**  When we remove those trees, not only are we changing the hydrological features of these  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:44):**  landscapes and sort of diminishing the hydrological capacity of those landscapes, not just to  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:50):**  bring water down, but also to take water up.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:54):**  And I think that this is one of the things we need to start talking more about when we  
**[0:04:57-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:04:57):**  are redesigning our farmed landscapes is how is water supposed to make it into drier inland  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:07):**  continental landscapes if there are no trees?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:11):**  That creates real problems and sort of allows inroads for processes like desertification.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:17):**  It's not just a tree there for storing carbon.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:21):**  The tree is there to deeply cycle water and nutrients and bring water to inland continental  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:28):**  landscapes.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:31):**  On our farm, one of the first things that I set about doing was planting intentional  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:37):**  through ways of trees, if you will.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:39):**  I mean, wildlife corridors is sort of what we call them, but the function of them is  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:43):**  really so multivariate that a wildlife corridor doesn't really capture it.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:48):**  But within the farm, making space for that architectural piece and then the shrub layer  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:05:55):**  as well really has actually facilitated a greater water holding capacity and a greater  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:01):**  flow of water through this property than was here before.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:07):**  There's an iconic tree in the state of Oregon, Quercus garyana, the Oregon white oak, which  
**[0:06:13-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:13):**  has at least heretofore had very little commercial value and no protection or legislation.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:22):**  So in America, the way that we value trees is whether or not, A, they have a place in  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:28):**  the market and then B, whether or not they've been given some protected status.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:33):**  And so the conversion of land in our little valley here has been at the expense to a large  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:40):**  degree of these iconic stately oak trees.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:45):**  And I think we have fundamentally missed their importance on the landscape, not just for  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:06:53):**  all of those things I was talking about earlier, but for our own cultural understanding of  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:01):**  why the aesthetics of a landscape actually do have value and why our farming needs to,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:09):**  I think, make room for the aesthetic of a healthy landscape.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:18):**  The idea behind the oak accord was really to gather landowners and intervene early on  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:27):**  before they've removed every tree on their property and explain to them the benefits  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:33):**  to their crops of leaving those trees on farm.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:36):**  You change your footprint a little bit, but it comes with so many benefits that far outweigh  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:42):**  the cost of that square footage that you give up by removing trees or even whole entire  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:48):**  corridors of trees.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:07:49):**  There are good reasons to think about leaving those behind.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:01):**  I visited Mimi's Vineyard and it is incredibly beautiful.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:05):**  A complex ecosystem with lots of wildlife and beautiful oak trees and really great wine.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:14):**  It definitely doesn't look anything like a conventional picture of a vineyard.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:18):**  When Mimi first shared about the importance of redundancy, I immediately reacted.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:24):**  I realized that for me the word redundant is only negative.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:30):**  That as she so quickly pointed out, redundancy is a key part of resilience as the human body  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:36):**  shows us and so much more.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:39):**  I think interesting to ask questions like, can redundancy be part of efficiency?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:08:45):**  Or maybe efficiency is the wrong focus when exploring systems that work in the long term

**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:10:28):**  maximizing human health and well-being.

**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:10:35):**  seeing that the excessive application of antibiotic modes of managing life is creating conditions  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:10:41):**  of blowback.

**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:03):**  Right the way up arguably to climate change and concerns about the Anthropocene and the

**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:16):**  and managing life.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:19):**  Much of the work in the book looks at the rise of rewilding.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:23):**  Conservation has been very preoccupied with protecting rare species, but there's a shift  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:28):**  in conservation now towards a focus on keystone species that will, by being given more agency,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:35):**  create habitats that are better for biodiversity, but also deliver ecosystem services.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:40):**  And we can begin to think of the ways in which that model of rewilding is coming to interface  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:45):**  with developments in agriculture.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:47):**  So conservation agriculture, which we've often seen to be oppositional to each other, we  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:52):**  see the ways in which farmers are revisiting older ways of understanding the role of particular  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:11:59):**  organisms in landscapes, as well as engaging with new science around the microbiome, let's  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:04):**  say, to begin to use particular organisms to address some of the problems with antibiotic  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:10):**  modes of managing life.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:12):**  We have this renewed rethinking of the role of cows as potential keystone species and  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:18):**  herbivore grazing as a way of enabling soil health improvement, but also shifts in terms  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:23):**  of how we think about crop rotations and the role of particular crops in improving soil  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:28):**  fertility or changes in the way we think about the role of pest control, where you might  
**[0:12:33-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:33):**  use the predators of particular pests in order to control pests other than using pesticides.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:46):**  You can cast your way back to various different points in time as an authentic model in which  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:53):**  you might manage agriculture towards.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:55):**  And yet what we know about climate change and the Anthropocene is that the future is  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:12:58):**  going to be unlike the past.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:03):**  So we're quite interested in the ways in which different ideas about nature, in particular  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:06):**  different ideas about the pastoral, if you like, the appropriate relationship between  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:10):**  people and livestock, are coming to shape contemporary debates about the future place  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:14):**  of livestock in the British countryside in terms of the relative number of animals in  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:19):**  the countryside, the ways that should be managed, the idea that there is a naturalistic model  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:23):**  of farming that could be simulated, that rubs up against other debates that your listeners  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:29):**  will be very familiar with about a kind of vegan model which sees cows as the problem  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:34):**  and we really need to radically move away from livestock.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:36):**  And so each of those finds different historic reference points to naturalise a future vision.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:41):**  And so part of our interest as social scientists is to look at those different stories and  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:46):**  the different ways they come into conflict.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:49):**  I'm doing some work at the moment thinking about the ways in which a new metric, GWP  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:54):**  100, is beginning to anoint some of these ways of thinking, particularly in how the  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:13:59):**  warming impacts of different greenhouse gases are communicated and understood in a climate  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:04):**  governance context.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:05):**  And I'm sure many of your listeners will know that methane is a short-lived gas, which means  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:11):**  that it will only last in the atmosphere and exert its warming influence for about 10 years.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:17):**  And GWP 100, which is the sort of standard metric used in climate governance, does a  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:21):**  relatively poor job of communicating that.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:24):**  And as a result, it's argued that it essentially overestimates the warming impact of methane  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:29):**  and as a result, the warming impact of ruminant management.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:33):**  For example, the great herds of bison roaming around the American plains produced as much  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:42):**  methane, it is argued, as contemporary livestock emissions.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:45):**  And so they begin to sort of as a parity in the emissions and therefore the warming impact  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:49):**  of those things.  
**[0:14:50-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:14:50):**  So I guess what we're now seeing is that metrics and the ways of knowing environments beginning  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:05):**  to sort of provide the framework in which contemporary emissions can be seen as an inheritance  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:10):**  of wild ecologies.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:13):**  We have a paper that's in preparation, which partly picks up on the story that James Rebanks  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:19):**  develops in the English pastoral about a sort of intergenerational shift in British farming.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:25):**  He talks about his grandfather who was using a very traditional system of farming and how  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:29):**  over his grandfather's life course, farming gets modernized and rationalized and we get  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:34):**  the separation of elements of the farming system and the kind of intensification of  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:39):**  farming, particularly in the Lake District, and how he now sees himself as very much pulling  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:44):**  historical techniques of British agriculture into the present, particularly around different  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:49):**  ways of revisiting cropping regimes and crop types.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:53):**  And George was doing some work, not in the Lake District, but in the sort of English  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:15:57):**  Welsh borders, looking at shifting cropping practices amongst farmers there, driven by  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:02):**  this interest in legumes in particular and their potential role in the farming system.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:08):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:09):**  I mean, obviously legumes have a great capacity to draw down and fix nitrogen into the soil,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:14):**  but they also make for good feed and forage for grazing animals.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:20):**  Whereas in America, you might want to situate your historical baseline against this sort

**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:30):**  grass, legume mixes with arable production as a way of sort of cycling nutrients around  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:36):**  the farm, not just as a way of minimizing and reducing the amount of fertilizer you  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:40):**  need to use, but also a way of achieving feed self-sufficiency.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:44):**  So all of those long and complicated supply chains related to feed production from soy  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:48):**  in South America, you can actually begin to produce your own foods through your own sort  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:52):**  of closed-loop nutrient systems.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:16:55):**  And like Jamie says, legumes emerge as this sort of relatively unfashionable crop, I  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:00):**  would say.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:01):**  There's not hugely sort of hip food stuff to be eating, beans and legumes, but when  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:06):**  we're thinking about using historical baselines as a way for justifying contemporary agricultural  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:11):**  management practices, in the UK, legumes emerges as this very important thing.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:16):**  I mean, I guess one other element that came out of that, in the context of the rise of  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:20):**  plant-based eating that we're seeing as very much a consumer trend, was the different ways  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:24):**  in which that appetite for legumes could go, isn't it?  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:27):**  So one was towards a kind of whole foods model where people very much knew where their legumes  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:31):**  came from and there were local supply chains, versus the kind of legume becomes a generic  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:36):**  protein substance, if you like, that just gets lost in a kind of wide commodity chain,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:40):**  and different visions for the future of legumes along those very different trajectories of  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:44):**  what could be described as a regenerative turn in agriculture could take place.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:48):**  One that's quite similar to mainstream commodity supply chains, another that's much more akin  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:53):**  to the kind of local agricultural supply chains that we'd associate with strands of community  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:17:58):**  supported agriculture, or even some versions of organic agriculture.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:02):**  Yeah, there's nothing inherent about the legume as a crop type and as a crop family that means  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:08):**  it's going to be a sort of act of resistance against an industrialized, international,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:13):**  intensified model of agriculture that, like Jamie says, we can imagine eating legumes  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:17):**  either as a sort of whole food that you know the producer, and there's, for example, fava  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:22):**  beans, and I'm sure your listeners will be familiar with hoverdads, but that's a great  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:26):**  resurgence of wanting to grow these traditional high protein foodstuffs in English soils,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:32):**  but they're also the sort of bog standard white flowers used to prop up highly processed  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:40):**  vegan foodstuffs.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:41):**  So there's nothing inherent about legumes, but it is an interesting sort of lens through  
**[0:18:48-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:18:48):**  which to look at different futures of agricultural change.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:05):**  I guess as a geographer, I'm always interested in how developments in one place relate to  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:10):**  developments in other places, and certainly if we're thinking about the rise of rewilding,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:17):**  let's say in temperate areas in Europe and North America, and the abandonment of marginal  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:22):**  farming in many areas that's enabled this resurgence of wildlife and the reforestation  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:27):**  of many parts of the world, arguably that's happened because of the globalization of agriculture,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:32):**  and so we've outsourced the supply of many of the things that would once have been grown  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:36):**  on that land to tropical regions, also enabled by the intensification of farming in sort  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:40):**  of more fertile areas, but we need to think about whether there's a net rewilding underway  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:45):**  or just a redistribution of the wild on a global scale, so we get more wild in the North,  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:49):**  less wild in the tropics, and then from a social justice perspective, we need to think  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:53):**  about who are the beneficiaries of that in terms of the publics who have access to that  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:19:56):**  wild and the publics who are exposed to deforestation, exposed to all the consequences of that locally,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:04):**  and likewise if we think about it in relation to having the ability to control one's microbial  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:10):**  exposure on the micro scale, which is if you like what the probiotic term suggests is that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:15):**  people can selectively cultivate desirable exposures to good microbes while keeping the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:20):**  bad microbes at bay, there's not many parts of the world where we have that degree of  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:24):**  control over microbial exposure, so although we might celebrate the rise of fermentation  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:30):**  practices and the interest in dietary movements that are about cultivating gut health, we  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:36):**  need to think about the degree to which those are accessible to everybody in places where  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:39):**  you've got very poor sanitation, you've still got lots of infectious disease, where you  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:44):**  can't take water quality for granted, let's say, so there's again an unequal global geography  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:49):**  as to where that probiotic term might be playing out.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:53):**  Just to add to Jamie's list of research questions, we're interested in I think the future of  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:20:59):**  particularly regenerative agriculture and its changing relationship with big corporate  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:07):**  agribusiness, there's an awful lot of interest being shown by Nestle and by Danone and by  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:11):**  Burger King, and to what extent this sort of corporate capture and involvement is going  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:16):**  to shape the movement over the next five or ten years, I really don't necessarily mean  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:23):**  that that's for the worst, the fact that a great number of farmers who are involved in  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:26):**  their supply chains are going to be exposed to their new requirements for purchasing policies  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:31):**  is quite an exciting opportunity, but it does also carry with it a number of potential perils  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:36):**  as well, so I think that's something we're very much interested in seeing, how all of  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:40):**  these promises being articulated by these agricultural movements will, which of them  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:45):**  will get preserved and which of them will get shelved and which of them will get prioritised  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:50):**  to service the different objectives that these big businesses have for their own participation.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:21:59):**  What we're very hopeful to do over the next phase of our research is to begin a substantial  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:05):**  piece of work on regenerative agriculture and to begin to explore that as a manifestation  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:10):**  of the probiotic turn in agriculture in the UK, and we'd obviously be very keen to hear  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:17):**  from your listeners who are very much at the forefront of driving this change, so if we  
**[0:22:22-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:22):**  come and tap you up and ask for an interview, please say yes when you hear from us.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:38):**  The Saw Collective is a community of chefs, florists and growers committed to an ethical  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:43):**  way of working with seasonal produce, advocating for positive ecological change in our food,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:48):**  flour and farming systems. One of the co-founders is Liv Wilson, who runs British flower studio  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:22:55):**  Weatherly. We asked Liv to share with us about her experience of shifting to more regenerative  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:02):**  techniques in her flower farming.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:05):**  The Saw Collective is a community of florists and chefs, founded by two florists, myself  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:11):**  and Jessica Geisendorfer and chef Lulu Cox. Jess and I met when we were freelancing as  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:19):**  florists and we became really disenchanted and upset basically by the use of imported  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:27):**  flowers in floristry. We both started growing our own and we wanted to support each other  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:34):**  in that. Then Jess introduced me to Lulu, who is a longtime friend, who is a chef, and  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:41):**  we started thinking about how important it was to have a conversation which also included  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:47):**  food because so often in events, the food might be really considered, it might be all  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:51):**  from local producers, but the flowers on the table were imported. So we set up Saw in order  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:23:59):**  to be able to create a more full circle conversation about seasonal produce. So when you're thinking  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:05):**  about an event, everything is considered. Making sure that I'm giving back to the land  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:10):**  as much as the land is giving me has become more of a primary consideration for me. I've  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:15):**  made that more of a goal into the terms of the way that I grow in those fields, trying  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:20):**  to improve the soil as much as possible and leave real designated areas for pollinators.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:27):**  What it means is that more of my time is spent thinking about what impact that's having and  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:32):**  trying to learn more things about what I can do to make a better, more positive impact.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:39):**  Jess and Lulu, when they started growing, they started with this intention right from  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:43):**  the beginning. So they started growing flowers in a polytunnel and immediately they really  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:49):**  had, the first thing they had to do was improve the soil quality because it had been farmed  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:52):**  previously in a conventional way. And so their first aim was to improve the soil before they  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:24:57):**  could even set about growing flowers. Whereas for me, I've been having to learn a lot and  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:05):**  rethink about a lot of the ways that I've been growing things because I think at the  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:09):**  start, my idea of improving the soil was just to put more compost on, more manure on it  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:14):**  every year. And I've learned a lot that it's a lot more complex than that. And we really  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:17):**  need to think about exactly what nutrients the soil needs. The first things were definitely  
**[0:25:25-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:25):**  green manures and cover crops because I used to find weeds really stressful and I used  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:35):**  to want it to look tidy and so I'd try my best to get rid of weeds. And I think in a  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:41):**  way that was unnecessary. Obviously, there are some weeds that are really not useful,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:48):**  sort of noxious weeds, but a lot of the other weeds, if the soil is covered, then that's  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:52):**  actually a lot more beneficial to the soil. It stops soil erosion, it wasting away and  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:25:57):**  also they are often doing, depending on the weed, but they're often doing positive things  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:02):**  for the soil anyway. So learning to try and replace my weeding habits with planting cover  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:10):**  crops, that would mean I didn't have to weed so much. So it was a kind of a double benefit.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:16):**  But also that they would specifically be doing good things for the soil. That was one of  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:20):**  the first things that I did. Obviously, it's good to have like polycultures, there's lots  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:24):**  of different types at the same time. They will do different things. Some are better  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:28):**  at nitrogen fixing, some are better at tap roots, breaking up the soil, and other than  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:33):**  providing carbon. So it's good to have a mix. So basically, it just means that also in between  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:39):**  sowings, if you've got a bed that's not got anything in it, rather than just leave it  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:43):**  bare, even though that might look tidy, or you know, you might think that's okay, it's  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:47):**  better to just put something in that short growing and then you can leave it leave it  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:50):**  there then dig it back into the soil afterwards. And that just means that there's never a time  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:26:55):**  when you're leaving the soil barren, I suppose. It's that generally feels really exciting.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:02):**  And it just feels so lovely when you look at the cover crops and you see how vibrant  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:07):**  the greens are. And you just you can just almost see in the colour that they're doing  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:11):**  something positive to the soil and then looking at the soil afterwards. I recently really  
**[0:27:17-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:17):**  excited to try growing salvia with roses, because apparently that keeps fungal diseases  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:25):**  at bay in roses. And also they attract lots of insects like aphids. So that are the two  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:32):**  issues that I have with roses are aphids and black spots. I'm really excited to try that  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:37):**  out. And I feel like the learning experience of finding out all these things which people,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:42):**  you know, have known for a really long time, but it's just not necessarily been at the  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:45):**  forefront in the way people have been thinking about farming flowers in a commercial way.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:50):**  The challenging thing in terms of the cover crops and stuff is that when they go to seed,  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:27:54):**  they go everywhere. And it makes things it can make things harder to harvest. Jess and  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:00):**  Lulu I think definitely had that problem with the tulips. They had really incredible clover  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:05):**  in between their tulips. And I think it really it would just was so happy there that it made  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:11):**  it more difficult to harvest. So that's one thing. Another thing I think is sowing at  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:15):**  the right time for me anyway, I certainly had that a couple of times when I last year  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:21):**  I just sowed it was and I think it's to do with the conditions of winter and then they  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:25):**  didn't really happen. So it meant that things were actually left better than I hoped. In  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:29):**  general, it just seems like a positive thing to do actually. And people are so helpful  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:32):**  Cotswolds seeds as well. They're amazing. They have got so much wealth information and  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:37):**  they're really readily available to support. One of the things about regenerative farming  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:45):**  and the principles behind it is doing things in a way which is also positive basically.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:50):**  So not trying to run before you can walk and really doing things slowly and manageably.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:28:54):**  And I think that's definitely something that we have tried to take on in our business practices.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:00):**  I think also having an ethical mindset when it comes to how we work with people and who  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:08):**  we work with and, you know, valuing people's time and those kind of things. I think that  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:15):**  the whole ethos of regenerative farming, I think that really transitions well into how  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:20):**  you approaching starting a business or anything that you do.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:25):**  For somebody who wants to start growing flowers commercially, what would you say would be  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:30):**  the best place or best places to start? Well, firstly, no dig beds because not disturbing  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:36):**  the soil too much is really important and it's really easy to create no dig beds. There's  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:42):**  so much advice on the internet. Charles Dowding is a great person to look at as well. So that  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:48):**  would be a good place to start. Secondly is something that we're looking into more this  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:29:54):**  year and it is more challenging is thinking about where you get your seeds from and, you  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:00):**  know, are they organic and that kind of thing. That's a really important thing to do. There  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:04):**  are lots of natural fertilizers which you can use like seaweed, which are hugely beneficial.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:11):**  There's actually no need to put anything chemical on your flowers at all. Another thing I'd  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:18):**  say is just reaching out to the community because the community is so friendly and supportive  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:23):**  and willing to help each other, which is one of the most amazing things. And people really  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:28):**  do have a wealth of knowledge to share. Do you know what? I think you really don't need  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:34):**  a huge amount of space actually. It depends really what your market is and what you're  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:37):**  wanting to grow for because if you want to grow for yourself to use for weddings and  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:45):**  events and then sometimes it's really nice to have lots of variety, but you really can  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:49):**  grow in a garden. I grow, I think it's just under three quarters of an acre is what I  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:30:55):**  currently cultivate at the moment. You know, I think that's pretty large space actually,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:00):**  although I am looking to expand because I just love flowers too much and there are more  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:05):**  varieties that I want to grow. I think the conversations about people thinking about  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:12):**  their food is really positive. That's happening a lot, but the same conversation is still  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:16):**  only just beginning, I think, in terms of flowers. And actually when you think about  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:21):**  imported flowers in a supermarket, they have the highest carbon footprint almost of any  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:27):**  product. And it's just, I mean, it's not just to do with the carbon footprint as well, there's  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:33):**  so many other ethical issues. A lot of it does come down to issues of demand. I think  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:38):**  it's unreasonable for us, or consumers, to want to expect to have flowers all year round.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:44):**  It's not natural, you don't see flowers, or many flowers at least during the winter. And  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:49):**  there's beautiful foliage and things that you can use. Flowers are a luxury and they're  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:52):**  beautiful to have and, you know, they bring so much positivity, but it's just essential  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:31:56):**  that our consumption of flowers also has a positive impact. So I think that's why it's  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:32:01):**  really great to have more conversations about intercropping and cover cropping and all the  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:32:06):**  kind of other things that you can do. Tiny changes that really actually don't take more  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:32:11):**  time but have huge impact. Yeah, I think it's the more conversations we have, the more people  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:32:17):**  adopt these kind of practices, the more normal it will be. And it will be that all flower  
**[0:32:21-0:32:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/66-ecosystem-agriculture-the-probiotic-turn-and-regenerative-flower-growing#t=0:32:21):**  plants in the UK are grown in this way, hopefully. That would be the dream.

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:00):**  Nourish is an organisation that was set up about five years ago, really to give a voice  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:14):**  to people who cared about changing the food system and make sure there was kind of political  
**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:21):**  representation of these ideas that were sort of thriving among civil society and local  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:28):**  food networks and people getting really engaged in creating alternative, healthy, fair, sustainable  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:33):**  food systems, but not having a platform really to engage in the political debate, which meant  
**[0:00:39-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:39):**  that still to this day we have a very powerful National Farmers Union of Scotland and very  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:46):**  powerful food industry and it's really those narratives that are still very strong in food  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:51):**  policymaking. So Nourish is here to try and redress the balance a bit and yeah, I guess  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:56):**  inject some different values into food policy. Three years ago, Nourish came together with  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:02):**  RSPB Scotland to instigate the Scottish Food Coalition, a civil society coalition with  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:08):**  a whole range of organisations involved from Unite and Unison, the Federation of City Farmers  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:14):**  and Gardens to obesity Action Scotland. So really covering different aspects of the kind  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:19):**  of health, sustainability and justice agenda in the food system. Our goal was to work together  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:25):**  for a whole system transformation and say, yeah, we need a food system that treats our  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:29):**  workers well and make sure that we're not killing off our bees and make sure there's  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:35):**  people not living in food poverty. All of those issues are urgent. So the Scottish Food  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:39):**  Coalition collaboratively wrote a narrative outlining the case for change in our first  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:45):**  report, which is plenty food farming and health in the new Scotland. And in this we advocated  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:49):**  for framework legislation to change the food system. We needed this cross cutting approach  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:56):**  to be taken forward by government as well. And this was published just before the Scottish  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:01):**  elections and we secured commitments to new framework legislation for the food system  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:08):**  from the SNP from Scottish Labour and from the Scottish Greens. How does the Good Food  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:13):**  Nation Bill in that case differ from previous legislation or how might it differ? I think  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:18):**  it's different in that it's taking this cross cutting approach to food. This is the first  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:22):**  time it's happened and it's happened very rarely across the globe. So Scotland has a  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:28):**  potential to really be world leading here in taking a kind of whole system approach  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:33):**  to food, which makes total sense because all of these issues impact and relate on other  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:38):**  issues. And so to develop really coherent and effective policies, then we need to look  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:44):**  at that whole messy picture of the food system rather than try and break it down into constituent  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:50):**  parts. So I think the Good Food Nation Bill is completely necessary for so many reasons.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:58):**  We're really facing crisis point on several aspects of our food system and creating damage  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:06):**  that's going to be really difficult to repair. So to give some examples, we're spending Â£1  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:13):**  in every nine of the NHS Scotland budget on diabetes. Over 90% of that is on type two  
**[0:03:18-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:18):**  diabetes, which is associated with diet. We've got 10% of children living in food insecurity  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:26):**  in Scotland growing up without access to adequate nutrition is so fundamental for their health  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:33):**  throughout their life, as well as their attainment and well being and yeah, it's really scary.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:42):**  At the same time, we've got the complete decimation of insect population, including pollinators.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:48):**  All of these things means it's going to be incredibly difficult to produce food well  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:52):**  in the future. So we definitely need much stronger leadership in terms of creating zero  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:59):**  carbon farming in the coming decades. And there's huge potential for this to happen.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:05):**  We've got the solutions. I think this is why the Good Food Nation Bill is so necessary,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:10):**  because there's so much potential for action right now.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:13):**  Can you maybe just give a little bit of an overview of the history of the bill really  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:18):**  kind of what has happened so far and where are we right now in the process?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:22):**  So Scotland has introduced cross cutting food policies previously. It had a Good Food Nation  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:29):**  policy in 2014. And before this a food policy called recipe for success, and especially  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:37):**  the Good Food Nation policy that brought in a lot more of the aspects of food beyond food  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:42):**  exports and food industry, which has really been the centre of the agenda until now. However,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:48):**  as a policy and not a piece of legislation, it didn't have any sort of legal binding,  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:54):**  and hasn't really shaped how the government makes decisions. We really need something  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:59):**  that is legally binding that holds ministers to account and that has longevity because  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:06):**  changing the food system isn't going to happen overnight and we need like a very clear commitment  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:11):**  to this agenda. We expect the public consultation to be launched in the next few months. But  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:17):**  this has been delayed several times already. So I think we're a bit sort of like, oh, yeah,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:24):**  it should be coming soon. But we've thought that for a while.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:27):**  From your point of view, or from Narsha's point of view, what would be the sort of best  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:31):**  case scenario for the bill? What is, what's the hope?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:35):**  I think we want the bill to do several things, but really two specific strands. One strand  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:42):**  on governance. We need a lot stronger mechanisms for governing our food system to ensure that  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:49):**  it's delivering on the things that we want it to deliver. And some specific programmatic  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:56):**  measures that really sort of catalyse change. So in terms of the governance measures, for  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:04):**  us, we think priorities include putting the right to food into Scott's law. So the right  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:09):**  to food is part of the economic, social and cultural rights in the UN. And whereas civil  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:15):**  and political rights were put into domestic law, we never put the economic, social and  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:21):**  cultural rights into law. We're advocating putting the right to food into Scott's law  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:25):**  and this will then guide the decisions of public bodies, including local authorities.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:31):**  And the right to food doesn't just encompass food insecurity. It's got the whole framework  
**[0:06:37-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:37):**  outlined by the UN, which covers the adequacy of food, the availability and the accessibility.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:45):**  So it's really about ensuring that everyone has access to good food that is meeting their  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:53):**  dietary needs, that is culturally appropriate, that is produced in ways that are sustainable.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:58):**  But it's also got something in the right to food that's about access to resources. It's  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:02):**  not just access to food. It's also about access to land and access to skills and knowledge.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:09):**  So we think the right to food framework is a really helpful framework in terms of we  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:13):**  can already draw on the knowledge that's been built up in the international community over  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:19):**  previous decades. We're not starting from scratch here. And so that would be the first  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:24):**  point to put the right to food into Scott's law and for that to guide future policy and  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:29):**  practice. Another point is to establish a statutory food commission. We've seen this  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:35):**  approach taken with the Land Commission, for example, with the Land Reform Act. And so  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:41):**  we believe that the Food Commission will be important for really scrutinising and monitoring  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:47):**  and ensuring that all of the vision and commitments in this new legislation are followed through.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:53):**  And so this might be something like reporting annually to Parliament on the state of Scotland's  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:57):**  food system, commissioning research if there's holes in knowledge. We also envision it to  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:03):**  have some civil society participation mechanism because we think obviously food affects all  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:10):**  of us. And it's really important that people aren't just sort of eating the consequences  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:16):**  of a food system, but are also really involved in shaping it. We also think that it's important  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:21):**  to have statutory targets similar to the Climate Change Act, for example. And we've seen that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:27):**  having targets really keeps it on the agenda and means that ministers and government are  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:33):**  held accountable. In terms of specific programmatic measures, these might be like a much more  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:40):**  radical approach to ensuring food procurement is in line with our sort of health justice  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:46):**  and sustainability goals. This could apply not only to direct food procurement in sort  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:51):**  of government buildings or schools or hospitals, but also to institutions that receive public  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:57):**  funding in this way if we were raising standards and ensuring that all food procured had to  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:03):**  treat workers fairly, met really good either organic or really high food production standards,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:09):**  met our dietary goals, and really normalised a sort of healthy, sustainable diet, as well  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:16):**  as that kind of cultural normalisation also supporting the development of infrastructure  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:21):**  for that. So short supply chains really creating a market for producers who want to produce  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:28):**  food to the highest standards. That's the sort of measure that could really support  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:32):**  the kind of wider shift in our food system. I think we hope that the Good Food Nation  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:38):**  bill will really catalyse a change in our food environment. So for a long time we've  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:44):**  had people blamed for their food choices, but what we want to do is change the context  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:49):**  within which food choices are made. So that might be mechanisms that place a responsibility  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:56):**  on multiple retailers and caterers to help us meet our dietary goals. Also might mean  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:02):**  sort of ban on promotions of food as high in fat, salt and sugar. Different planning  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:09):**  measures that would support our high streets to actually ensure that the healthy, sustainable  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:15):**  choice is really accessible for everyone. What do you see as the main obstacles to an  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:23):**  effective Good Food Nation bill? I think there's several challenges. Firstly, this kind of  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:29):**  cross-cutting framework approach hasn't been done very much before. We've seen the Scottish  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:36):**  Parliament take a sort of really interesting approach to the Land Reform Act, to the Community  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:41):**  Empowerment Act, and we know that they are broadly interested in progressive policies.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:49):**  I think one of the challenges is for a long time the food system has been seen to be about  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:56):**  producing commodities for export. Before we've had a food and drink team in the Scottish  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:02):**  Parliament, their whole raison d'etre is to increase exports. We have news reports about  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:09):**  the Scottish success story of now our food exports are worth X amount, increased by so  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:15):**  much from last year or whatever. So there's really a very fundamental philosophical question  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:20):**  around what is our food system for? Is it for making money or is it for nourishing people?  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:28):**  I think that actually we're struggling to get buy-in from people in the food and drink  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:35):**  team in the Scottish Parliament that the latter, nourishing people, has to be the priority.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:42):**  It's really interesting, we've had a lot of research coming out recently about the external  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:47):**  cost of cheap food. We know it's really not good value for money to focus on exports.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:53):**  The amount that we get from exports does not in any way match the amount we spend treating  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:59):**  the consequences of a food system that is focused on exports or that is focused on producing  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:05):**  commodities. Another challenge specific to the Good Food Nation Bill in Scotland right  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:09):**  now is that I don't think we've got the commitment of the First Minister in any really significant  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:17):**  way to this piece of legislation. It could be completely world-leading and groundbreaking  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:24):**  but it's going to be really complicated. It's a cross-cutting framework piece of legislation  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:28):**  so really demands strong leadership. I think another problem is that we're not going to  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:34):**  have strong leadership from government, we need a really strong civil society politicised  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:41):**  food movement and we've got a lot of action on the ground in Scotland to create an alternative  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:46):**  food system. We've got people running community meals, amazing community gardens all over  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:51):**  the country, people setting up social enterprises and really innovative ways of tackling the  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:58):**  kind of corporate power of our food system, taking it into our own hands and creating  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:02):**  an alternative food system which is really exciting. However, those projects and initiatives  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:09):**  aren't necessarily joined up and aren't necessarily connected into this political agenda which  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:15):**  is why I think organisations like Nourish and Scottish Food Coalition have a very important  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:20):**  role to play right now. It's a bit of a leap for people to really understand what we're  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:27):**  trying to achieve for the Good Food Nation Bill and what their part in this is or it  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:31):**  can be. And I think we've got a lot of narratives that are really unhelpful but remain quite  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:39):**  powerful because they receive media attention. So these might be that we need to produce  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:46):**  more in order to feed the world. It's a narrative that's been pushed by big agribusiness for  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:52):**  a long time and fundamentally we don't need to produce more. What we've got is a problem  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:58):**  with waste and a problem with distribution. Another narrative would be that sort of linked  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:04):**  to that we need cheap food. Actually cheap food means the abuse of animals in the food  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:09):**  system, it means the exploitation of workers, it means irreparable damage to our ecosystems,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:17):**  it means food that's not good for our health and yeah we're living in a two tiered food  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:22):**  system where if you've got enough income then you can afford a diet that keeps you healthy.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:28):**  Whereas if you don't then you face that double burden of poverty and ill health because you're  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:33):**  not eating food that's good for you. And so actually we need to raise incomes and we need  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:39):**  to think of different ideas to ensure that everyone has access to good food. We've got  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:44):**  universal access to healthcare at the moment actually or education. Those fundamental needs  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:51):**  for health and education we're like oh yeah everyone should have access to them. But below  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:55):**  that that basic need for access to really good food we've not created any sort of societal  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:01):**  interventions to make sure that need is met for everyone.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:07):**  On the question of the sort of obstacles I guess to making the bill really effective  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:14):**  and the question of nourish Scottish Food Coalition versus, I'm kind of deliberately  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:22):**  being provocative, versus something like NFU Scotland, how much scope do you see there  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:28):**  for common cause or bridge building? Yeah I think there's huge common cause or  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:34):**  huge potential to build common cause with organisations that we're not natural allies  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:39):**  with whether that's National Farmers Union of Scotland or other sort of industry bodies.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:46):**  Because I think these problems that I've been outlining in terms of the kind of sustainability  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:52):**  or economic issues in our food system they're recognised across the board. Everyone knows  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:58):**  that we can't carry on business as usual and certainly we're going to have different  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:03):**  priorities as Nourish or the Scottish Food Coalition to NFUS. But we've also got some  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:11):**  really clear things in common and in terms of the climate change bill that's upcoming  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:18):**  we've been working actually quite closely with NFUS to try and develop policies that  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:23):**  are supported by both the environmental NGOs and the Farmers Union. And that's been a  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:31):**  really interesting and productive process and really hope to kind of continue that way  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:37):**  of working where we're able to work collaboratively. I think it's really important for us that  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:44):**  that doesn't mean we're going to always limit our ambitions to what's acceptable  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:50):**  to other organisations. And so we definitely don't want to water down some of our commitment  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:56):**  to really transformative legislation. But at the same time we really recognise we've  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:02):**  got organisations representing food producers in the Scottish Food Coalition and really  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:07):**  recognise that actually the system right now doesn't work for producers either and there's  
**[0:17:13-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:13):**  huge common goals with the NFUS on that. As part of their efforts to help as many people  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:25):**  as possible contribute to the consultation, Nourish and the Scottish Food Coalition have  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:30):**  invited people to host kitchen table talks. These are chances to gather and share ideas  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:35):**  about Scotland's relationship with food and especially what the government's role  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:39):**  should be in shaping that relationship. Kitchen table talks are an opportunity for  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:46):**  everyone in Scotland to take part in discussions about the food system and what the Good Food  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:54):**  Nation Bill might do, might achieve. We really wanted to reach out to people and provide  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:01):**  a resource that could stimulate some discussions sort of in homes, in workplaces, in schools  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:07):**  and communities because the food system does affect all of us in really fundamental ways  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:14):**  and we've had such little power as civil society in deciding food policies or how the  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:20):**  food system is working and that really needs to change. And I think it's something that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:26):**  people don't necessarily think about that much, especially in terms of the whole food  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:30):**  system and what it is and what it means. We've become very isolated from it and it's quite  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:36):**  invisible in a lot of ways. So yeah, the kitchen table talks are really kind of the first step.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:42):**  We hope that people come on a longer journey with us and get really involved in campaigning  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:48):**  on the Good Food Nation Bill. They're also about sort of introducing the Good Food Nation  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:52):**  Bill to people across Scotland because very few people know about it right now and it  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:58):**  is this huge opportunity for groundbreaking legislation. We've been promoting kitchen  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:04):**  table talks to Scottish Crofting Network and a couple of the early ones we've had were  
**[0:19:09-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:09):**  from producers and growers actually and we've also promoted it to NFUS and through Community  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:18):**  Garden Network as well. You can host a quick kitchen table talk by downloading the packs  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:23):**  from either the Norwich Scotland website or the Scottish Food Coalition website and there's  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:30):**  sort of a background document on the Good Food Nation Bill and also some guidance notes  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:35):**  for hosts and a bit of a template to fill it in. It's all quite a simple process. You  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:41):**  can also fill in the form as an individual. We're really keen to hear as many people's  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:46):**  ideas as possible. Kitchen table talks are a way for people to share their main concerns  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:51):**  about the food system. So one aspect of it is to kind of collectively as a group work  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:56):**  out your top five concerns about the food system and we've had really interesting responses  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:02):**  ranging from food banks or promotion of unhealthy food to children or the bees or you know there's  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:10):**  so many issues going on right now and so it's really helpful for us as NGOs to get a better  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:16):**  idea of what really matters to people. Another aspect of the kitchen table talks is coming  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:22):**  up with your top five priorities for action and the emphasis here is on action from government.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:29):**  We've had for a long time sort of oh you should choose organic or you should choose what's  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:34):**  healthy within a food system that is broadly not supportive of making those choices. We  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:41):**  didn't reduce smoking by telling people to smoke less. We reduced smoking by creating  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:47):**  really transformative policies. That's the kind of thing that's going to transform the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:53):**  food system. It's not some people making better food choices, it's really significant interventions  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:59):**  that set us on a different path. How do you think the kitchen table talks can reach beyond  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:05):**  the usual suspects, i.e. people like me and my friends? It's a good question. The short  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:10):**  answer is I could start a whole load of ideas of things that we could do but actually we're  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:15):**  running kitchen table talks with pretty much zero funding. We did a crowd funder at the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:21):**  end of last year to sort of cover the bare cost of it but it's just something that as  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:28):**  an organisation we felt was really really important and wanted to do. So it's been quite  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:31):**  difficult because we haven't been able to then really put the energy into doing events  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:36):**  all over the country or ways that we could really reach out to people. But I think something  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:41):**  that's really nice about the kitchen table talks is quite often people who take part  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:45):**  in one then are interested in hosting one and so we've had that kind of knock-on effect  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:51):**  which is great. So I think it is starting to happen and it's very gradually gaining  
**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:55):**  momentum. Unfortunately we're only running them until the 15th of April because we do  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:02):**  expect the public consultation to be launched very soon. We've had some contact with the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:08):**  bill team and they're really interested to see what comes out of the kitchen table talks  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:14):**  so we'll be starting analysis of the responses on April 23rd. So you have until then to submit  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:20):**  your feedback to host a kitchen table talk and people really care about food. Everywhere  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:26):**  we go we have very passionate discussions. I think that it's through really broad participation  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:33):**  and getting everyone's views about this and ideas about this and not only shaping that  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:40):**  kind of continually participating in the development of these policies that will make them so much  
**[0:22:45-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:45):**  more robust and effective and meaningful and acceptable to people. So yeah I think the  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:54):**  ambition with the kitchen table talks and we hope leading on from them with the public  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:58):**  consultation is that we really send a very strong message to the Scottish Government  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:23:04):**  that the people all in Scotland really care about food, we really need a different food  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:23:09):**  system and we've got plenty of ideas to make that happen.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:23:16):**  In the next episode of Farmerama we'll listen in to a kitchen table talk. In the meantime

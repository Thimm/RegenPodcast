**[0:00:00-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:00):**  Nourish is an organisation that was set up about five years ago, really to give a voice  to people who cared about changing the food system and make sure there was kind of political  representation of these ideas that were sort of thriving among civil society and local  
**[0:00:28-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:28):**  food networks and people getting really engaged in creating alternative, healthy, fair, sustainable  food systems, but not having a platform really to engage in the political debate, which meant  that still to this day we have a very powerful National Farmers Union of Scotland and very  
**[0:00:46-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:00:46):**  powerful food industry and it's really those narratives that are still very strong in food  policymaking. So Nourish is here to try and redress the balance a bit and yeah, I guess  inject some different values into food policy. Three years ago, Nourish came together with  
**[0:01:02-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:02):**  RSPB Scotland to instigate the Scottish Food Coalition, a civil society coalition with  a whole range of organisations involved from Unite and Unison, the Federation of City Farmers  and Gardens to obesity Action Scotland. So really covering different aspects of the kind  
**[0:01:19-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:19):**  of health, sustainability and justice agenda in the food system. Our goal was to work together  for a whole system transformation and say, yeah, we need a food system that treats our  workers well and make sure that we're not killing off our bees and make sure there's  
**[0:01:35-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:35):**  people not living in food poverty. All of those issues are urgent. So the Scottish Food  Coalition collaboratively wrote a narrative outlining the case for change in our first  report, which is plenty food farming and health in the new Scotland. And in this we advocated  
**[0:01:49-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:01:49):**  for framework legislation to change the food system. We needed this cross cutting approach  to be taken forward by government as well. And this was published just before the Scottish  elections and we secured commitments to new framework legislation for the food system  
**[0:02:08-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:08):**  from the SNP from Scottish Labour and from the Scottish Greens. How does the Good Food  Nation Bill in that case differ from previous legislation or how might it differ? I think  it's different in that it's taking this cross cutting approach to food. This is the first  
**[0:02:22-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:22):**  time it's happened and it's happened very rarely across the globe. So Scotland has a  potential to really be world leading here in taking a kind of whole system approach  to food, which makes total sense because all of these issues impact and relate on other  
**[0:02:38-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:38):**  issues. And so to develop really coherent and effective policies, then we need to look  at that whole messy picture of the food system rather than try and break it down into constituent  parts. So I think the Good Food Nation Bill is completely necessary for so many reasons.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:02:58):**  We're really facing crisis point on several aspects of our food system and creating damage  that's going to be really difficult to repair. So to give some examples, we're spending Â£1  in every nine of the NHS Scotland budget on diabetes. Over 90% of that is on type two  
**[0:03:18-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:18):**  diabetes, which is associated with diet. We've got 10% of children living in food insecurity  in Scotland growing up without access to adequate nutrition is so fundamental for their health  throughout their life, as well as their attainment and well being and yeah, it's really scary.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:42):**  At the same time, we've got the complete decimation of insect population, including pollinators.  All of these things means it's going to be incredibly difficult to produce food well  in the future. So we definitely need much stronger leadership in terms of creating zero  
**[0:03:59-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:03:59):**  carbon farming in the coming decades. And there's huge potential for this to happen.  We've got the solutions. I think this is why the Good Food Nation Bill is so necessary,  because there's so much potential for action right now.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:13):**  Can you maybe just give a little bit of an overview of the history of the bill really  kind of what has happened so far and where are we right now in the process?  So Scotland has introduced cross cutting food policies previously. It had a Good Food Nation  
**[0:04:29-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:29):**  policy in 2014. And before this a food policy called recipe for success, and especially  the Good Food Nation policy that brought in a lot more of the aspects of food beyond food  exports and food industry, which has really been the centre of the agenda until now. However,  
**[0:04:48-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:04:48):**  as a policy and not a piece of legislation, it didn't have any sort of legal binding,  and hasn't really shaped how the government makes decisions. We really need something  that is legally binding that holds ministers to account and that has longevity because  
**[0:05:06-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:06):**  changing the food system isn't going to happen overnight and we need like a very clear commitment  to this agenda. We expect the public consultation to be launched in the next few months. But  this has been delayed several times already. So I think we're a bit sort of like, oh, yeah,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:24):**  it should be coming soon. But we've thought that for a while.  From your point of view, or from Narsha's point of view, what would be the sort of best  case scenario for the bill? What is, what's the hope?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:35):**  I think we want the bill to do several things, but really two specific strands. One strand  on governance. We need a lot stronger mechanisms for governing our food system to ensure that  it's delivering on the things that we want it to deliver. And some specific programmatic  
**[0:05:56-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:05:56):**  measures that really sort of catalyse change. So in terms of the governance measures, for  us, we think priorities include putting the right to food into Scott's law. So the right  to food is part of the economic, social and cultural rights in the UN. And whereas civil  
**[0:06:15-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:15):**  and political rights were put into domestic law, we never put the economic, social and  cultural rights into law. We're advocating putting the right to food into Scott's law  and this will then guide the decisions of public bodies, including local authorities.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:31):**  And the right to food doesn't just encompass food insecurity. It's got the whole framework  outlined by the UN, which covers the adequacy of food, the availability and the accessibility.  So it's really about ensuring that everyone has access to good food that is meeting their  
**[0:06:53-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:06:53):**  dietary needs, that is culturally appropriate, that is produced in ways that are sustainable.  But it's also got something in the right to food that's about access to resources. It's  not just access to food. It's also about access to land and access to skills and knowledge.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:09):**  So we think the right to food framework is a really helpful framework in terms of we  can already draw on the knowledge that's been built up in the international community over  previous decades. We're not starting from scratch here. And so that would be the first  
**[0:07:24-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:24):**  point to put the right to food into Scott's law and for that to guide future policy and  practice. Another point is to establish a statutory food commission. We've seen this  approach taken with the Land Commission, for example, with the Land Reform Act. And so  
**[0:07:41-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:41):**  we believe that the Food Commission will be important for really scrutinising and monitoring  and ensuring that all of the vision and commitments in this new legislation are followed through.  And so this might be something like reporting annually to Parliament on the state of Scotland's  
**[0:07:57-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:07:57):**  food system, commissioning research if there's holes in knowledge. We also envision it to  have some civil society participation mechanism because we think obviously food affects all  of us. And it's really important that people aren't just sort of eating the consequences  
**[0:08:16-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:16):**  of a food system, but are also really involved in shaping it. We also think that it's important  to have statutory targets similar to the Climate Change Act, for example. And we've seen that  having targets really keeps it on the agenda and means that ministers and government are  
**[0:08:33-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:33):**  held accountable. In terms of specific programmatic measures, these might be like a much more  radical approach to ensuring food procurement is in line with our sort of health justice  and sustainability goals. This could apply not only to direct food procurement in sort  
**[0:08:51-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:08:51):**  of government buildings or schools or hospitals, but also to institutions that receive public  funding in this way if we were raising standards and ensuring that all food procured had to  treat workers fairly, met really good either organic or really high food production standards,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:09):**  met our dietary goals, and really normalised a sort of healthy, sustainable diet, as well  as that kind of cultural normalisation also supporting the development of infrastructure  for that. So short supply chains really creating a market for producers who want to produce  
**[0:09:28-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:28):**  food to the highest standards. That's the sort of measure that could really support  the kind of wider shift in our food system. I think we hope that the Good Food Nation  bill will really catalyse a change in our food environment. So for a long time we've  
**[0:09:44-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:09:44):**  had people blamed for their food choices, but what we want to do is change the context  within which food choices are made. So that might be mechanisms that place a responsibility  on multiple retailers and caterers to help us meet our dietary goals. Also might mean  
**[0:10:02-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:02):**  sort of ban on promotions of food as high in fat, salt and sugar. Different planning  measures that would support our high streets to actually ensure that the healthy, sustainable  choice is really accessible for everyone. What do you see as the main obstacles to an  
**[0:10:23-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:23):**  effective Good Food Nation bill? I think there's several challenges. Firstly, this kind of  cross-cutting framework approach hasn't been done very much before. We've seen the Scottish  Parliament take a sort of really interesting approach to the Land Reform Act, to the Community  
**[0:10:41-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:10:41):**  Empowerment Act, and we know that they are broadly interested in progressive policies.  I think one of the challenges is for a long time the food system has been seen to be about  producing commodities for export. Before we've had a food and drink team in the Scottish  
**[0:11:02-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:02):**  Parliament, their whole raison d'etre is to increase exports. We have news reports about  the Scottish success story of now our food exports are worth X amount, increased by so  much from last year or whatever. So there's really a very fundamental philosophical question  
**[0:11:20-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:20):**  around what is our food system for? Is it for making money or is it for nourishing people?  I think that actually we're struggling to get buy-in from people in the food and drink  team in the Scottish Parliament that the latter, nourishing people, has to be the priority.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:42):**  It's really interesting, we've had a lot of research coming out recently about the external  cost of cheap food. We know it's really not good value for money to focus on exports.  The amount that we get from exports does not in any way match the amount we spend treating  
**[0:11:59-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:11:59):**  the consequences of a food system that is focused on exports or that is focused on producing  commodities. Another challenge specific to the Good Food Nation Bill in Scotland right  now is that I don't think we've got the commitment of the First Minister in any really significant  
**[0:12:17-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:17):**  way to this piece of legislation. It could be completely world-leading and groundbreaking  but it's going to be really complicated. It's a cross-cutting framework piece of legislation  so really demands strong leadership. I think another problem is that we're not going to  
**[0:12:34-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:34):**  have strong leadership from government, we need a really strong civil society politicised  food movement and we've got a lot of action on the ground in Scotland to create an alternative  food system. We've got people running community meals, amazing community gardens all over  
**[0:12:51-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:12:51):**  the country, people setting up social enterprises and really innovative ways of tackling the  kind of corporate power of our food system, taking it into our own hands and creating  an alternative food system which is really exciting. However, those projects and initiatives  
**[0:13:09-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:09):**  aren't necessarily joined up and aren't necessarily connected into this political agenda which  is why I think organisations like Nourish and Scottish Food Coalition have a very important  role to play right now. It's a bit of a leap for people to really understand what we're  
**[0:13:27-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:27):**  trying to achieve for the Good Food Nation Bill and what their part in this is or it  can be. And I think we've got a lot of narratives that are really unhelpful but remain quite  powerful because they receive media attention. So these might be that we need to produce  
**[0:13:46-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:13:46):**  more in order to feed the world. It's a narrative that's been pushed by big agribusiness for  a long time and fundamentally we don't need to produce more. What we've got is a problem  with waste and a problem with distribution. Another narrative would be that sort of linked  
**[0:14:04-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:04):**  to that we need cheap food. Actually cheap food means the abuse of animals in the food  system, it means the exploitation of workers, it means irreparable damage to our ecosystems,  it means food that's not good for our health and yeah we're living in a two tiered food  
**[0:14:22-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:22):**  system where if you've got enough income then you can afford a diet that keeps you healthy.  Whereas if you don't then you face that double burden of poverty and ill health because you're  not eating food that's good for you. And so actually we need to raise incomes and we need  
**[0:14:39-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:39):**  to think of different ideas to ensure that everyone has access to good food. We've got  universal access to healthcare at the moment actually or education. Those fundamental needs  for health and education we're like oh yeah everyone should have access to them. But below  
**[0:14:55-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:14:55):**  that that basic need for access to really good food we've not created any sort of societal  interventions to make sure that need is met for everyone.  On the question of the sort of obstacles I guess to making the bill really effective  
**[0:15:14-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:14):**  and the question of nourish Scottish Food Coalition versus, I'm kind of deliberately  being provocative, versus something like NFU Scotland, how much scope do you see there  for common cause or bridge building? Yeah I think there's huge common cause or  
**[0:15:34-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:34):**  huge potential to build common cause with organisations that we're not natural allies  with whether that's National Farmers Union of Scotland or other sort of industry bodies.  Because I think these problems that I've been outlining in terms of the kind of sustainability  
**[0:15:52-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:15:52):**  or economic issues in our food system they're recognised across the board. Everyone knows  that we can't carry on business as usual and certainly we're going to have different  priorities as Nourish or the Scottish Food Coalition to NFUS. But we've also got some  
**[0:16:11-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:11):**  really clear things in common and in terms of the climate change bill that's upcoming  we've been working actually quite closely with NFUS to try and develop policies that  are supported by both the environmental NGOs and the Farmers Union. And that's been a  
**[0:16:31-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:31):**  really interesting and productive process and really hope to kind of continue that way  of working where we're able to work collaboratively. I think it's really important for us that  that doesn't mean we're going to always limit our ambitions to what's acceptable  
**[0:16:50-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:16:50):**  to other organisations. And so we definitely don't want to water down some of our commitment  to really transformative legislation. But at the same time we really recognise we've  got organisations representing food producers in the Scottish Food Coalition and really  
**[0:17:07-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:07):**  recognise that actually the system right now doesn't work for producers either and there's  huge common goals with the NFUS on that. As part of their efforts to help as many people  as possible contribute to the consultation, Nourish and the Scottish Food Coalition have  
**[0:17:30-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:30):**  invited people to host kitchen table talks. These are chances to gather and share ideas  about Scotland's relationship with food and especially what the government's role  should be in shaping that relationship. Kitchen table talks are an opportunity for  
**[0:17:46-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:17:46):**  everyone in Scotland to take part in discussions about the food system and what the Good Food  Nation Bill might do, might achieve. We really wanted to reach out to people and provide  a resource that could stimulate some discussions sort of in homes, in workplaces, in schools  
**[0:18:07-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:07):**  and communities because the food system does affect all of us in really fundamental ways  and we've had such little power as civil society in deciding food policies or how the  food system is working and that really needs to change. And I think it's something that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:26):**  people don't necessarily think about that much, especially in terms of the whole food  system and what it is and what it means. We've become very isolated from it and it's quite  invisible in a lot of ways. So yeah, the kitchen table talks are really kind of the first step.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:42):**  We hope that people come on a longer journey with us and get really involved in campaigning  on the Good Food Nation Bill. They're also about sort of introducing the Good Food Nation  Bill to people across Scotland because very few people know about it right now and it  
**[0:18:58-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:18:58):**  is this huge opportunity for groundbreaking legislation. We've been promoting kitchen  table talks to Scottish Crofting Network and a couple of the early ones we've had were  from producers and growers actually and we've also promoted it to NFUS and through Community  
**[0:19:18-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:18):**  Garden Network as well. You can host a quick kitchen table talk by downloading the packs  from either the Norwich Scotland website or the Scottish Food Coalition website and there's  sort of a background document on the Good Food Nation Bill and also some guidance notes  
**[0:19:35-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:35):**  for hosts and a bit of a template to fill it in. It's all quite a simple process. You  can also fill in the form as an individual. We're really keen to hear as many people's  ideas as possible. Kitchen table talks are a way for people to share their main concerns  
**[0:19:51-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:19:51):**  about the food system. So one aspect of it is to kind of collectively as a group work  out your top five concerns about the food system and we've had really interesting responses  ranging from food banks or promotion of unhealthy food to children or the bees or you know there's  
**[0:20:10-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:10):**  so many issues going on right now and so it's really helpful for us as NGOs to get a better  idea of what really matters to people. Another aspect of the kitchen table talks is coming  up with your top five priorities for action and the emphasis here is on action from government.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:29):**  We've had for a long time sort of oh you should choose organic or you should choose what's  healthy within a food system that is broadly not supportive of making those choices. We  didn't reduce smoking by telling people to smoke less. We reduced smoking by creating  
**[0:20:47-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:20:47):**  really transformative policies. That's the kind of thing that's going to transform the  food system. It's not some people making better food choices, it's really significant interventions  that set us on a different path. How do you think the kitchen table talks can reach beyond  
**[0:21:05-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:05):**  the usual suspects, i.e. people like me and my friends? It's a good question. The short  answer is I could start a whole load of ideas of things that we could do but actually we're  running kitchen table talks with pretty much zero funding. We did a crowd funder at the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:21):**  end of last year to sort of cover the bare cost of it but it's just something that as  an organisation we felt was really really important and wanted to do. So it's been quite  difficult because we haven't been able to then really put the energy into doing events  
**[0:21:36-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:36):**  all over the country or ways that we could really reach out to people. But I think something  that's really nice about the kitchen table talks is quite often people who take part  in one then are interested in hosting one and so we've had that kind of knock-on effect  
**[0:21:51-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:21:51):**  which is great. So I think it is starting to happen and it's very gradually gaining  momentum. Unfortunately we're only running them until the 15th of April because we do  expect the public consultation to be launched very soon. We've had some contact with the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:08):**  bill team and they're really interested to see what comes out of the kitchen table talks  so we'll be starting analysis of the responses on April 23rd. So you have until then to submit  your feedback to host a kitchen table talk and people really care about food. Everywhere  
**[0:22:26-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:26):**  we go we have very passionate discussions. I think that it's through really broad participation  and getting everyone's views about this and ideas about this and not only shaping that  kind of continually participating in the development of these policies that will make them so much  
**[0:22:45-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:22:45):**  more robust and effective and meaningful and acceptable to people. So yeah I think the  ambition with the kitchen table talks and we hope leading on from them with the public  consultation is that we really send a very strong message to the Scottish Government  
**[0:23:04-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown#t=0:23:04):**  that the people all in Scotland really care about food, we really need a different food  system and we've got plenty of ideas to make that happen.  In the next episode of Farmerama we'll listen in to a kitchen table talk. In the meantime

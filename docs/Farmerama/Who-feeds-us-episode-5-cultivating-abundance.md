**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:00):**  It was really, really early in the morning and it was still foggy. I sat there until  
**[0:00:06-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:06):**  the fog lifted and then it was a really beautiful summer's morning. Just the simplicity. I felt  
**[0:00:15-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:15):**  really humbled to be in that space. My head just felt like I come from maybe a long line  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:22):**  of women or that are around the world doing this. I felt a sense of connection. It made  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:28):**  me curious as to who else in my family or my lineage did this or how they feel about  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:33):**  the land. I felt pretty small actually in comparison to a global farming community,  
**[0:00:41-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:41):**  but it was quite instrumental in that keep going, just keep going because it will come.  
**[0:00:50-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:00:50):**  Who Feeds Us from Farmerama Episode 5 Cultivating Abundance  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:02):**  In this episode, we visit one region, the West Midlands, to explore how the pandemic  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:08):**  has highlighted connections between the local and the global, the present and the past,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:14):**  and between food, health, community and identity. What can we learn from this time about the  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:21):**  experiences, the resources and the needs of individuals and communities in the UK, and  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:28):**  in particular communities of African descent? How can having access to land, to green space  
**[0:01:34-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:34):**  and to growing space feed us in multiple ways, physical, emotional and spiritual?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:47):**  Linda McFarlane is based in Handsworth in Birmingham. She's the founder of Vegan Vibes,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:53):**  a non-profit that runs plant-based pop-up restaurants and food workshops, as well as  
**[0:01:57-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:01:57):**  local markets, known as Earth Markets. As Linda puts it, Vegan Vibes champions a cruelty-free  
**[0:02:05-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:05):**  and creative way of living and communicating. I really do feel that Vegan Vibes is my little  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:14):**  contribution to justice. And when I say justice, I mean, I dream of a world where things like  
**[0:02:22-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:22):**  poverty alongside extreme greed or waste is no longer a thing that is acceptable. I dream  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:32):**  of a world where it's normal to be kind and to help people who need help the most. There's  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:38):**  no harm to living things. If I could contribute to that, maybe not in my lifetime, but set  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:45):**  a seed going forward, I would have done something to make my existence valuable or to leave  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:52):**  something behind. Vegan Vibes is really a plant-based approach to mental health and  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:02:57):**  to enterprise. It's something that I see as not just myself, but I would like to set footprints  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:04):**  for others to follow in, as I am following in the footprints of others. It's all about  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:10):**  the vibration really, warmth, kindness, not being judgemental. These are conditions that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:17):**  I think humans do well to grow in. Another element of the Vegan Vibes project is a community  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:26):**  allotment space called the Earth Garden. Linda's motivation for setting up the Earth Garden  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:33):**  was very personal. It was about much more than just the desire to grow food. I had in  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:40):**  the past, due to circumstances, suffered with depression. For me, being in nature, being  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:45):**  in the garden, that's just where I vibrate. I started a sort of a gardening club with  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:52):**  some of my friends. We took on an allotment and unfortunately, due to work commitments  
**[0:03:57-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:03:57):**  and so forth, it died off. But I kept going and I kept going with my children. But why  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:06):**  I did that is because I would have loved the opportunity to go to a space where I could  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:14):**  putter around. I don't have to divulge any of my personal life, but I could actually  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:20):**  be there and I could either use it as a chance to reflect or to grow or to learn or to heal.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:28):**  But I think in the spirit of kindness to myself, I love to share. And if I had wanted that,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:36):**  there may be somebody who still would want it. If there's a go to space that's safe,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:42):**  that we can work together and you can pop in and do as much or as little as you like,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:48):**  that would have been something that I think I would have enjoyed.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:04:56):**  In early March, another West Midlands resident returned from a trip abroad and found himself  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:02):**  in a changed country.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:04):**  My name's Andre Reed. I'm a designer, architectural designer based in Walsall, UK. When it came  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:09):**  to the lockdown, the initial lockdown, I was just coming back from Zimbabwe where there  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:14):**  was no lockdown and where there was observing the UK from far. So when I came back, it was  
**[0:05:19-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:19):**  a week before lockdown and what I found was just this really glum energy. You could feel  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:27):**  people retracting and trying to just arrange and organise food provision because we're  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:33):**  starting to see the food disappear from the supermarkets and even from the local corner  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:39):**  shops. It's around that time that I realised the situation was in many ways very serious.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:45):**  I was getting so much information, so much conflicting information that I didn't know  
**[0:05:53-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:05:53):**  what to believe. At the same time, in my area, I was very angry when I saw the roads really,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:02):**  really, really quiet, but there are just dozens and dozens of police vans almost patrolling  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:10):**  the streets. It had the fear factor and I've never, ever seen that before where even to  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:18):**  go for a walk, no, I don't know, am I going to get stopped? And then I decided, you know  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:23):**  what, just stop, just stop and slow down. It was a wake up call for me actually because  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:31):**  I realised that I had so much. What happened for me in that period was I was grateful for  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:39):**  my life and I realised that a lot of things that I thought were important in the grand  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:46):**  scheme of things were not as important as I initially thought. I've got my life now.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:06:54):**  How do I want to live? How do I choose to live with the life I've got?  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:00):**  We went into lockdown and one of the first things that came to mind was like, how can  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:07):**  we grow fresh fruit and vegetables? And I'd done a bit of stuff on urban farming before  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:14):**  and got linked into a WhatsApp group and we all got talking about how we want to build  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:20):**  like a more sustainable space and a sustainable, I guess, local economy for us to access food.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:28):**  So what we started to do was invite loads of different people into the group, people  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:31):**  that had permaculture backgrounds, people that were just local people that really kind  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:37):**  of believed in this same mission of like, what can we do to become more sustainable,  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:41):**  to become more resilient as a wider kind of network slash community. And that's how the  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:48):**  urban farmers WhatsApp group was made, which is now, I think, approaching like 60 members  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:07:54):**  and is an array of just local people that really want to do good things with their neighbourhoods  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:00):**  and see growing and food as central elements in that.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:06):**  And Linda is one of those people. Andre first met Linda a few years ago when he attended  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:12):**  one of her pop up meals in Handsworth, featuring an affordable and locally sourced menu. One  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:18):**  of the reasons Linda serves and promotes plant based food is that it's inherently cheaper  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:23):**  and healthier.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:25):**  We loved it. We was amazed because it was really, really good and it was really, really  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:29):**  cheap and we couldn't understand how it was so good and how it was so cheap. We went and  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:35):**  asked for the chef and like asked, how did it start and what is this? And that's where  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:40):**  we met Linda. And Linda told us about all the great and amazing things she has planned  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:46):**  and the vision she has in terms of how important it is for the black community to have good  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:08:54):**  food and have access to locally grown fresh food. Linda has this vision of how we can  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:01):**  take ownership and stewardship of green spaces and of growing spaces for the community and  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:07):**  to feed people in a really healthy way.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:10):**  Vegan Vibes essentially will have 10 projects, but I'm just concentrating on three at the  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:16):**  moment. So when one part wasn't able to continue, we still were doing food for the elderly,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:24):**  food for the vulnerable and transporting it out there so people would have cooked vegan  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:30):**  meals. So the food element of it was still going ahead. The Earth Gardens project was  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:35):**  still going ahead. So that's been a blessing. It's still in progress, but it's a small  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:41):**  allotment space and it's a garden where we grow and it's not just growing vegetables.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:46):**  It could be growing in self-confidence or growing in awareness or spirituality, whatever  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:51):**  it is. But I want to make it really pretty. It's flowers, it's an opportunity to plant  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:09:58):**  something in memory of someone. And then the phase two element of it is growing more on  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:05):**  the produce side so we can feed some of the food back into our earth markets when we come  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:12):**  out of this social distancing situation. So we've got local food that is grown by local  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:19):**  people that we would like to keep as organic or as heritage in its seedage as possible  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:27):**  so that people from all backgrounds can get access to. So it doesn't have to be so expensive,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:32):**  they can't afford it. And hopefully if this model takes off, then we can really become  
**[0:10:38-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:38):**  more self-sufficient, not just in the cultivation of food, but in the planting, in the distribution,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:47):**  in the eating of it, so that we become more self-sufficient on a micro scale. And that's  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:53):**  to me the principle of the Earth Garden. So it's not just impacting mental health, but  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:10:59):**  hopefully if I can provide employment in a small way, then I'm providing enterprise as  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:06):**  well.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:07):**  Linda, Vegan Vibes and the Earth Garden are part of a long history of community growing  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:13):**  practices in the West Midlands. And it's particularly in times of crisis that these practices come  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:19):**  to the fore. Through a project called Digging Around, Birmingham-based sociologist Dr Lisa  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:25):**  Palmer investigated and highlighted this history.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:30):**  The idea was to look at sustainable practices in Birmingham from the past in a way that  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:35):**  it could inform the future. There was a lot of material there in the archives. It was  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:41):**  material that the city council had collected over a period of time, administrative documents  
**[0:11:49-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:49):**  and local histories about green space. As the story unfolded, it turned out that Birmingham  
**[0:11:58-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:11:58):**  was like the allotment capital of the UK, which is not what you would have expected.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:07):**  Allotments played a really pivotal role, both in the First World War, the interim war period,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:14):**  the Second World War and the post-war period as well. And again, Birmingham is not a space  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:20):**  associated with necessarily green spaces, but it has a really strong history of caring  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:27):**  for its green spaces, of developing parks and allotments. Even if you go around the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:35):**  city, you'll see hanging baskets, containers that come alive during the spring, summer  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:43):**  months. It's got a history of competing for Britain in bloom and winning competitions  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:49):**  about that. So it's kind of this really strange sort of pride in its green heritage. And I  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:12:55):**  guess what I came across in terms of the growing practices is the way that the usage of land  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:01):**  will shift depending on the political context that we're in. But the archive project that  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:08):**  I worked on called Digging Around highlighted was the way in which land becomes reused for  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:13):**  different things and how the government can reclaim a particular space, such as a park,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:21):**  to do other things like to grow food in times of crisis. For example, the purpose of a park  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:27):**  was for leisure, but actually they repurposed that park during the time of crisis to grow  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:33):**  wheat because there was a shortage of wheat at particular points during the Second World  
**[0:13:38-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:38):**  War. And so the kind of contestation over land usage and what we can use the land and  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:47):**  who controls the land and who owns the land is always very, very political and actually  
**[0:13:54-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:13:54):**  I think cuts to the core of some of our most urgent social problems. A lot of allotment  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:15):**  spaces were bequeathed to the city. They were given to the city by the land gentry of the  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:22):**  city. People who had access and ownership of land and saw it as part of their civic  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:29):**  mission to perhaps share that land with local communities. And it's not just altruistic  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:36):**  or just for the greater good. I think there is perhaps an element of that, but it was  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:40):**  also linked much more broadly to developing an economically viable and healthy workforce  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:48):**  and allotments supported that. So you saw that with the way in which Cadbury's Bournville  
**[0:14:53-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:14:53):**  Village was very much an example of a big global manufacturer of chocolate caring for  
**[0:15:03-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:03):**  its workforce in the UK. And I guess the question that I was constantly asking myself was what  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:13):**  were the limits of that social consciousness? And so for example, if we look at Cadbury's  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:18):**  in the growing of cocoa, what the archives demonstrated is that the same sort of care  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:25):**  for workers at Bournville was not demonstrated for the growers in West Africa. These disparities  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:33):**  in economics, disparities in workers rights, disparities of who deserves to be paid a particular  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:41):**  wage and who doesn't. I think those questions of the past are still with us today. I think  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:47):**  they're very much part of the politics of this day. So I think there are ways in which  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:53):**  we can look at those sustainable practices and see that even if they're sustainable,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:15:59):**  they still may have some problematic colonial inheritances, colonial kind of legacies, if  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:06):**  they think social media brings the kind of new forms of communication, but these conversations  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:14):**  in a much more immediate, accessible domain. It gives me hope and it's also kind of a point  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:20):**  of despair is that in one sense, it gives you hope that these kind of conversations  
**[0:16:24-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:24):**  that we're having hopefully shine a kind of focus on the importance of these kind of histories.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:33):**  But also what they also do is point to the places where environmental injustices, unsustainable  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:42):**  practices have a huge impact on the lives of people of colour, black people in particular,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:50):**  and people who occupy vulnerable spaces in the world where land insecurity still remains  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:16:58):**  a huge issue. What this conversation does is allow other people to enter into that space  
**[0:17:06-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:06):**  and to kind of bring their experts knowledge or their lived experience.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:23):**  When I set this garden up, I felt that I wanted to open the space so that I could share. And  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:32):**  I was asked the question, so why don't you want it for yourself? Why don't you have it  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:37):**  for yourself first, see how you feel and then open it up. But I never saw it like that.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:44):**  I see my home garden as mine, but the space I saw where there's laughter, where there's  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:53):**  music, where there's different input. And I saw it as that and I still do see as that  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:17:59):**  and I'm going with that. When we talk about the community, I really wanted to focus on  
**[0:18:08-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:08):**  women of African heritage. I see us as a group of people who are either unrepresented or underrepresented  
**[0:18:22-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:22):**  or misrepresented. And we have become almost a group of people that don't exist anymore.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:32):**  So we don't advocate for much, we just put our heads down, get on with it. And lately  
**[0:18:37-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:37):**  I've been hearing quite a lot of women that have passed and they've passed either tired,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:46):**  angry, overworked, not have fulfilled their potential. And I really wanted to say, hey,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:18:55):**  did you know that there's a space where you can come and rest, where you are seen, you  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:00):**  are appreciated, you are heard. You can give something back or you can just be in this  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:06):**  really pretty space and I'll make you feel like a lady. I really want the African community  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:14):**  to get back to the land. I really want them to focus on eating well, to growing well,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:21):**  or to understand principles of growing so that this can be translated abroad. So this  
**[0:19:30-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:30):**  is basically a pilot so that we can really start seeing the benefits of this principle.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:39):**  And if I can share this principle with other people, then I'm hoping that it will really  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:44):**  take off. It's in our heritage that we grow, you know, get back to nature. Nature is healing,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:52):**  it's wonderful, it's open to the elements, things that are actually indigenous to this  
**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:19:58):**  country that are actually healing for us. So yes, I do think that the African and Caribbean  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:06):**  or communities of African descent, being close to the land is very, very healing.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:13):**  Allotments are often used as spaces as a way for people to kind of help themselves to live  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:21):**  with mental health issues, whatever problems that those might be. And that is, again, that  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:27):**  is not new, that was apparent during the interwar years as well. Allotments were important for  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:33):**  people who were formerly part of the army and had returned back from war and who were  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:39):**  looking for work but were unemployed. And allotments were used as one way to kind of  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:45):**  mitigate against mental health issues. So I think that idea of healing is really critical,  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:20:55):**  really important. And it has a lot of resonance for, I think, particularly for Caribbean communities  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:02):**  who have enjoyed an experience of growing back home, to have that experience of growing  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:09):**  in the UK.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:11):**  So the ability to access allotments and other green spaces has a particular significance  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:16):**  for the UK's black communities.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:18):**  We're living through a global pandemic, but that pandemic is also related to, you know,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:23):**  the pandemic of racism at the moment, the social injustice, the racialized forms of  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:29):**  injustice that have been brought to our attention. And I guess in that context, when we think  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:36):**  about black communities or black identities, particularly in urban spaces, they're associated  
**[0:21:44-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:44):**  with a struggle and they're also constructed in particular ways that depict black lives  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:21:53):**  and black people's lives as being one dimensional. What is beautiful about thinking about black  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:01):**  lives in a much more complicated space in terms of how they occupy green spaces in the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:08):**  city, it gives a different insight into multiple layers of the black experience that are not  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:18):**  given any focus or attention.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:21):**  Lisa Palmer's work focusing on that historic piece of what happened with the African Caribbean  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:27):**  community coming from a place in the Isles in like Jamaica or Barbados or any of the  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:33):**  Caribbean Isles in which people came or people that have come directly from Africa and West  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:39):**  Africa or East Africa. These are spaces where people would step outside and throw seeds  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:45):**  on the ground and watch it grow. You know, we have a connection specifically with being  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:51):**  able to have that freedom to grow food and to have that space to appreciate freshly grown  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:22:58):**  produce that you can constantly return to, not having to go to the shop, just growing  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:03):**  it on your doorstep, to an urban environment where everything is so systemised around retail  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:08):**  and purchasing goods rather than cultivating them that when we settled, we looked for these  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:14):**  opportunities in the allotments, that kind of rekindling of being at home and being able  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:20):**  to have harvest and to share food and to share memories and to share experiences centred  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:25):**  around the cultivation of food and the sharing of it.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:29):**  It gives you a kind of ownership over your plate. Obviously there's an aspect of eating  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:39):**  fresh food that's about nourishing your body and the immediacy of having something fresh  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:46):**  to eat that you don't have to go out and buy. I think there was also an element of enjoyment  
**[0:23:53-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:23:53):**  and pleasure. I do remember with relatives that used to visit friends on allotments or  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:01):**  relatives that had allotments, there was that sense of excitement and satisfaction that  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:07):**  they could pick their own callaloo, that they could pick their own country pepper, they  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:12):**  could watch their peas grow. Even my dad, you know, if I go around there, he'll show  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:18):**  me how well or not his callaloo is growing. Just satisfaction, satisfaction that you could  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:25):**  grow something that you perhaps used to have in the Caribbean, but you can actually grow  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:30):**  it in either your back garden or your allotment plot in Hemsworth or Perryvale or wherever  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:37):**  your allotment might be. I actually don't have the space to grow anything anymore. I  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:43):**  recently moved. It did make me feel a little bit vulnerable about that in some ways, not  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:48):**  having access to the land and not being able to dig the land. That was quite strange to  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:53):**  happen in a moment of crisis in this space and time that we're in at the moment during  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:24:59):**  COVID. I think for my dad, it may have had quite an important influence on what he wanted  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:05):**  to grow this year and the amount of what he wanted to grow. So I think most definitely  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:11):**  it does have an impact or is having an impact. For my dad, I think it's a space that he can  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:18):**  have some sense of control over in terms of where to go to, to kind of enjoy his growing  
**[0:25:26-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:26):**  practices, but also enjoy the foods that it produces as well. I kind of like the culture  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:45):**  that exists in the allotment spaces, the kind of ethics and practice of sharing, sharing  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:51):**  food and exchanging food. It's always exciting. It's always interesting, but it's also kind  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:25:58):**  of gives us an insight into a different way to live and to kind of be with each other.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:05):**  It's not just about monetary exchange. It might be exchanging a pumpkin for a bunch  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:12):**  of spinach or a chard or something. One of my very first experiences when I got to my  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:19):**  very first allotment plot was the generosity of some of the older gentlemen from all different  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:26):**  backgrounds coming over and sharing tips or even their tools with me. And not only sharing  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:33):**  that, but giving me seeds and helping me and instructing me. I'd love to be able to pass  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:39):**  down the love of growing to younger people. And certainly when I go to the plot, I've  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:44):**  always tried to make it as safe and as accessible as possible so that all generations can be  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:49):**  there so that they can have that experience. And even if they don't take it up as readily  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:26:56):**  as I've done or other people have done, but they've had that experience that they may  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:00):**  draw on later on in their lives. So I want to make the love of growing a multi-generational  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:08):**  and intergenerational experience. There's just lots of space for new fresh energy coming  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:14):**  in. It's really interesting that whenever someone  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:17):**  starts a community project now, we center it on food and growing. It's really interesting  
**[0:27:24-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:24):**  that for a lot of us, our society is so focused around work and exchange, monetary exchange.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:34):**  And when people think of community projects, they think of growing, cultivating, and sharing,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:40):**  a sharing economy. And so there is something in how communities feel closer through access  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:48):**  to land, through access to space, to cultivate and grow together, not just food, but to actually  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:27:54):**  grow as a community, those spaces to physically interact and to share and generate ideas about  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:01):**  what the world or what their neighborhoods could look like.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:07):**  So how could we make these green spaces, spaces for growing, for resting, and for collectively  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:13):**  imagining, how could we make those spaces available to all communities, both here in  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:19):**  the West Midlands and elsewhere? My belief is that we all have access to growing  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:26):**  space. It's not necessarily soil. It's wherever we are. I think it's a matter of being able  
**[0:28:32-0:28:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:32):**  to easily access the tools to create, to transform any space into a growing space. So could there  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:40):**  be ways in which you could walk down the street and pick up all the tools you need? They could  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:46):**  be recycled. They could be repurposed. They could be shared, but from a neighbor, I don't  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:49):**  know at this point in time. But some way of communities being able to access these sorts  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:28:56):**  of tools for free or for a very limited cost so that we can actually start to transform  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:03):**  our living spaces that aren't traditionally designed for growing into growing spaces and  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:10):**  also being able to go outside and look at all of the green spaces, the verges, all of  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:17):**  these green spaces that exist strictly for aesthetics or potentially sound breakers in  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:22):**  the environment, can these also be seen as growing spaces? For me, it's a matter of perspective  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:28):**  and just acknowledging that there's an abundance of opportunities and things at our disposal  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:34):**  to make the world how we want it to be. Every other organism on the planet, bar humans,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:40):**  except that food is everywhere. And it's just a matter of your perspective. If a street  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:46):**  has a green patch, it needs to be growing food. And if it doesn't, we need raised planters.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:53):**  And rather than have the councilmen come and waste a day's wage collecting them because  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:29:58):**  they're seen as unauthorized street furniture, pay someone to go around and actually cultivate  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:04):**  them and keep them healthy and keep them growing good quality food and saying, this is how  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:09):**  much food is here. When lockdown happened, it was just basically fulfilling the plot  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:16):**  brief, putting in the infrastructure, sowing seeds. Now we're at a time when there's great  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:23):**  harvest, but initially there wasn't a lot going on at all, but now that there is. So  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:30):**  should we go through this again, then we've got the infrastructure already there to be  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:37):**  able to put things in. And what we will be doing in our phase two plot, as I did today,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:43):**  is start preparing and start planting stuff for the winter. So should we be in the situation  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:49):**  again, we will have food, hopefully all year round, something at least, and being able  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:30:56):**  to store things as well is quite important.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:00):**  The change that I would like to see come out of this period going into the new year is  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:05):**  one where we're literally on the game. And when I say on the game, I mean, for a lot  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:11):**  of us, and I've had these conversations as well, we're going back to our parents and  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:17):**  our aunties and our uncles, and we're asking them the questions about how they cultivated  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:23):**  and grew food. And we're starting to practice them and teach them to our kids. What I would  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:28):**  like to see in the future is that heritage and that legacy pulled into how we operate  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:34):**  and look at the future, but with an added twist of how we implement technology into  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:40):**  those rituals, those practices, how we implement architecture and create beautiful growing  
**[0:31:45-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:45):**  spaces that are able to produce foods that we've not been able to see grown where we've  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:31:53):**  settled for so long. And I'd like to see more of our youngest people appreciating that  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:00):**  process of cultivating food and growing spaces and just appreciating green spaces because  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:07):**  we're in the city all the time. I'd like to see more of those things happening in our  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:12):**  community. I feel like it's proven it's really good for our mental health and our wellbeing.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:19):**  In my mind's eye, I would like women in different inner city areas to be able to come together  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:25):**  in a space and have it not just as a place of cultivation, but have it as a space of  
**[0:32:31-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:31):**  beauty. So put thought into it. And I am not in any way, shape or form a landscape gardener.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:40):**  But what I would advocate is that alongside vegetation is beauty. So things that create  
**[0:32:48-0:32:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:48):**  tranquility like water or roses or beautiful flowers, because we do work so hard and a  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:32:58):**  part of balance is as well as working hard, we also need to rest unapologetically. That  
**[0:33:04-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:04):**  is part of healing is to rest without feeling guilty. And if we can do it, I'd love to be  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:12):**  able to see other people that are doing it too.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:18):**  As undeniably challenging as these past few months have been, what they've also revealed  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:23):**  is the resilience and the resources that already exist in communities in the West Midlands  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:29):**  and across the UK.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:31):**  I have seen people pull together. I think it's really encouraging that people have a  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:39):**  sense of community. I've been inspired by generosity. I've been inspired by people giving  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:47):**  selflessly. I've been blown away by the amount of ingenuity when people have thought of stuff  
**[0:33:55-0:34:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:33:55):**  and just made it happen. Yeah, I've come away with a sense of slowing down and slowing down  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:04):**  and trusting the process for people who didn't know how they would cope, but they've coped  
**[0:34:10-0:34:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:10):**  seeing their surprise and their own strengths. This lockdown situation has been really challenging  
**[0:34:19-0:34:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:19):**  for some people, but they've survived. They've survived despite them thinking that they couldn't  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:27):**  and it's taken them on a whole other trajectory. Although it's been hard, but I think a lot  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:33):**  of people have come away with being surprised at their own resilience. And I have really,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:39):**  really loved that. And I've really appreciated that in seeing it and hopefully being a part  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:45):**  of that.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:52):**  What gives me hope is things like this, things that, my goodness, you've heard about. Wow,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:34:59):**  it just started off as an idea and I made it happen and I'm doing it. So that gives  
**[0:35:06-0:35:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:06):**  me hope. The future is emerging and the bigger picture is yet to come. That gets me out of  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:14):**  bed in the morning. So I do have a vision. It's beginning to unfold and yeah, I'm really  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:22):**  optimistic. If you've heard about me, then that's really good. In going forward, what  
**[0:35:29-0:35:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:29):**  really has been a central part of my life has been going back to the land as a therapist,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:37):**  as a human being, as a woman. That was really me. And I think I've gone back to what I was  
**[0:35:45-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:45):**  like when I was a young girl and even coming in today soaked. I'm like, this is so good.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:35:56):**  I managed to have a hot drink and sit around a log fire. And to me, it doesn't get any  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:36:04):**  better just being out in the elements. And for me, that's gone right to the top of how  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:36:11):**  I choose to live going forward. And I've come back absolutely buzzing. I did what I wanted  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:36:17):**  to do. I managed to plant, connect with people, touch the soil, open to the elements and yeah,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:36:24):**  I'm actually really good. So this phase of existence has been instrumental for me because  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-5-cultivating-abundance#t=0:36:31):**  now I'm choosing how I want to live the rest of my life.

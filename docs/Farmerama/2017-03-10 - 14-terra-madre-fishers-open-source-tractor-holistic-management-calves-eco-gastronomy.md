## 14: Terra Madre fishers, open-source tractor, holistic management, calves & eco-gastronomy  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  The noise you can hear is the Slow Food Tierra Madre Salon de Gusto parade. There are literally  
**[0:00:11-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:11):**  thousands of people marching from all around the world for Slow Foods.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  This month we are live from Turin, Italy, where thousands of small-scale farmers, shepherds,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:30):**  fishers, chefs and people committed to more resilient food systems from over 100 different  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:35):**  countries all around the world have come together to celebrate and share food and farming knowledge.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:42):**  It's really like the UN for food systems. This is Slow Food Salon de Gusto Tierra Madre.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:51):**  Welcome to Farmerama. Welcome to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:56):**  Nigel, can you explain to listeners what Slow Food Movement is?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:01):**  The Slow Food Movement was founded by Carlo Petrini back in 1986. It's essentially the  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:08):**  antidote to fast food. He set it up as a way of promoting more local, traditional foods  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:16):**  and a better, healthier, fairer food system.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:21):**  Yes, and I heard Carlo speak at the opening ceremony, which was in an outrageously lavish  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:28):**  theatre in the middle of town. I initially felt that was a little bit at odds with a  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:35):**  movement which is really about indigenous people and farming people's relationship with  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:42):**  the land. But I sort of left in the end actually feeling quite positive about it. There were  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:47):**  a lot of farmers in the room and a lot of farmers speaking, as well as a lot of politicians,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:52):**  and I guess that you sort of need those two ends of things if you're going to make change.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:57):**  I really liked what Carlo was focusing on, stressing in front of these political leaders  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  that we live in a world where the economy just really doesn't represent farmers at all.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  He spoke very clearly about, as a society, we just simply have the wrong relationship  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:14):**  with food. And I was struck by sort of comparing, he was talking about hunger on one side and  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:21):**  then obesity on the other side, and both using examples of how much they cost us in terms  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  of our emotional well-being as much as economically. This whole festival, this whole gathering  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:35):**  being a sort of focus for really addressing the fact that our relationship with food and  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  producing and farming is wrong. And he speaks brilliantly and it was really quite inspiring.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  But here we are now, we're at the Valentino Park in another part of Turin. Abby, maybe  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:57):**  you could explain a little bit about what your impression is of.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:01):**  So for me, this event is incredibly exciting because of the variety, diversity of people  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:09):**  that get together in one place. I think that kind of thing happens with heads of states  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:16):**  and quote-unquote important people quite often. But here it's actually the producers and the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:22):**  people from the land and the chefs and people actually doing things and making things, coming  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  together and sharing their ideas from places like Guinea-Bissau to Poland. Like everyone's  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:33):**  here, it's crazy. This all kind of came to a head when we went to the parade where 7,000  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:40):**  farmers, food artisans, fishers, indigenous people, activists, leaders, citizens from  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:44):**  143 countries paraded through the streets of Turin sharing culture, dancing, singing.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  And most importantly, we were joined in voices echoing the shared message of saving biodiversity  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:56):**  and feeding the world sustainably.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:58):**  My name is Asia. We are from Russia, North Caucasus, and we came here to Terra Madre.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:07):**  We want to save our traditional products, our traditional food.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:12):**  People call me Ab, but my name is Abdelaman. I'm from Italy, but I was born in Morocco.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:17):**  I think about the food, I think about the farmers, the farmers that they work hardly  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:22):**  to give the people good food. So if I tell you about food, I tell you I love the farmers.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  I love every person that work with the green, with the products, the fishers, every person  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:35):**  that live with the food.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  My name is Andrea. I'm a teacher. I know that we need to change the words and how are we eating the food.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:51):**  My name is Tiamah. I'm Burkina Faso. The diversity of agriculture in Africa is a time  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  for finding solutions for the natural system.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:11):**  My name is Caroline. I'm from Denmark.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:14):**  What's your reason to be here today?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:17):**  I'm going to be helping the earth.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:20):**  Yes, more or less. I study. I'm a student. I study economics.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  My name is Shohei from Japan. After Terra Madre, we have to change the Japanese style by the slow food.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:44):**  There will be a lot more from Chuen later in the show, but we're also going to be sharing  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:49):**  some stories from other places we've been in the last few weeks.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:53):**  Last week I was at GO-DAN, Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition Conference in New York.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:00):**  A meeting of heads of state, data experts from around the world and completely different  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:07):**  to the sort of vibe here.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:09):**  But I'd like to share a story and it's a product really from someone I met there.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:13):**  It's a technology to empower the small scale farmer and the business model is one really focused  
**[0:06:19-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:19):**  on the needs of the farmer, not big business. The machine's open source and it's really simply designed  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:27):**  so farmers can fix it locally by themselves.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  Hi, I'm Lockie Catron with the company Kleber. We're manufacturing the Ogun tractor and we're based  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  out of Paint Rock Valley, Alabama. The goal of the Ogun tractor is to enable the rebirth of the small  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  family farm, both in the United States but also all around the world. 80% of the world's farmers are  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:51):**  small and so we have to serve those farmers first in order to feed the world.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:57):**  The Ogun tractor is a small scale 19 horsepower tractor that is made using common components so that  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:03):**  farmers can fix it in the field, fix it in the shop and find parts locally.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:08):**  So this tractor is ideal for small farmers that have anywhere under 80 acres.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:13):**  One of our founders is from Cuba and one is from Alabama. So the one from Alabama grew up farming  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  with mules so he understands what it's like to not have any sort of mechanization on the farm.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:24):**  And then the other one's from Cuba, Saul Berenthal, and he always wanted to go back and do business  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:29):**  in his country and do something that actually benefited the people of his country.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:33):**  So we started designing this tractor at the end of 2014 when the President of the United States in  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:39):**  Cuba announced that they would begin to mend the relationship between the two countries.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:43):**  And so we first designed the tractor for Cuba and they loved our business model which is an open  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  system manufacturing approach. We're the first U.S. company approved to manufacture in Cuba.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:54):**  Well right now the equipment industry has totally ignored the small farmer and they don't have any  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:59):**  equipment out there for the small farmer and especially not at an affordable price.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  And that's largely because of their business model. They lock the farmer in so they have to go back to  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:09):**  them for parts, they have to go back to them for service. So our whole business model is giving freedom  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:14):**  back to the farmer, letting them be independent. We will publish the designs for our tractor and for  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:19):**  everything that we end up producing so they can buy them from our manufacturer, they can use implements  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:24):**  from other companies or they can build their own if that's cheaper or if they have a better and new idea  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:29):**  for an implement. Farmers are innovative people, farmers are capable people and many of them want to  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  fix their own equipment but they just can't because it's built so complicated. So by providing a simple  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:40):**  tractor anyone can learn how to fix it and many of them already know how to do that.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:46):**  But what they can also do with the architecture that we have is go and take it to someone that they know  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:51):**  that can do it so they don't have to go back to a dealership from our company. We don't even have  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:57):**  dealerships but they can take it to a local shop. So it's all about building up the local economy as well.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:02):**  Farmers in the developed world are extremely excited about this because they are so tired of not being  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:08):**  able to fix their own equipment. They just want the freedom to be able to do that and they realize that no  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:13):**  one is serving them, no one is serving that market of farmers. So that's what we want to do. And for the  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  developing world they're just excited to have any sort of mechanization. If you're using an oxen to plow  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  your field a tractor looks a whole lot better. Thank you, Locky. Sound good, Nigel? Yeah, I like the look of it, Joe.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:31):**  I think certainly for small scale arable and horticultural farmers I think this tractor offers a lot of  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:40):**  opportunities. And I love the fact that it's open source and the fact that you can fix it very cheaply and  
**[0:09:46-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  it's not an expensive bit of kit. It's pretty amazing stuff.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  So Terra Madre is a sort of conference, it's a meeting of farmers, it's a meeting of academics and thinkers.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:13):**  But there's another side to what's going on here this weekend and that is Salone del Gusto. We're actually sat  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:20):**  maybe 100 meters from where this is going on. I think there's around 1200 exhibitors from all around the  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:27):**  world bringing their local traditional foods, credible produce, cuisine from all around the world and from  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:36):**  over 100 countries and it's incredible to be able to walk around, talk to the people who produce that food,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:42):**  taste the food and really get a feel for what they're doing. I mean the really interesting thing this time  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  they're doing it is that the Salone del Gusto is spread out throughout the whole city. So in the past it was  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:56):**  all in one massive hall, which is great, but I think it's quite nice to spread it out amongst the city and really  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:03):**  bring it alive and bring the sort of culture of the city to life.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:07):**  One of the talks that I've attended was about something called Eco-Gastronomy, which is a project which comes out  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:14):**  of the Slow Food University which is in Bra, which is where we've been staying actually and it's about 30 minutes  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:19):**  outside of Tewin. Essentially David is talking about how we need to think about, he's talking about a way to think  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  about food in terms of our whole body. So not just what it tastes like, not just its nutritional value, but the smell,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:34):**  how it makes us feel, where it fits into the economy and the whole web of production from the farmer who grows the food  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  to the recipes we remember from our grandmother, to sort of, I don't know, thinking about the value of food  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  in a broader way. And of course attention on food in this way has to be important to the farmer.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:56):**  I'm David Santo and I am what we're calling a professor at large for the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:04):**  And my project is to move around to different places, co-organize events with different local partners and events that  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:12):**  focus on different issues in different formats that make sense for that place. So it could be anything from a roundtable  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:18):**  discussion to a meal to a storytelling event to a workshop, depending on what those people I work with think should happen.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:25):**  I think one of the things about food is that the sensory properties of it are always present. They're not invisible and they're not  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:32):**  unsmellable, they're not untasteable, we just don't taste them or smell them or touch them. We have deactivated our senses  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:40):**  in day-to-day life to a large extent and that comes from a whole tradition of Western thinking and philosophy and the belief  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:46):**  in higher and lower senses and the belief in the mind-body separation, the belief in even the division between self and other.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  So this is one of the reasons that the word eco and eco-ecological are very important to me because they remind us to  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:59):**  pay attention to the whole system that is participating in what we sense as the reality of food.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:07):**  Ecology and performance to me are my sort of touchstones and my anchor points for everything that's gastronomy because they remind  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:15):**  us that it's the whole thing that produces the effect, just as the whole ecology produces an effect in a sort of natural environment.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:22):**  The whole ecology of food, including language, meaning, significance, symbolism, including materiality, substance,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  physicality, including the processes of transformation and harvesting and cooking and growing and even what happens in a seed  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:38):**  is a performance. And we talk about in fact the way seeds perform or materials perform. There's a lot of engineering science that  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:43):**  talks about the performance of food, but we don't think about it as a very holistic performance. And that's what's super important  
**[0:13:49-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:49):**  about doing anything with food is recognizing we're not the center, we're not the only agents, and a lot of other stuff are  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:59):**  performing, a lot of other things are performing while we think it's us that's in control.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:05):**  I actually think farmers already know all this stuff. Farmers and cooks, but even more farmers are more present to the  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  performance of the entire environment in producing what happens with them. They see and feel and sense climate, soil,  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:23):**  microorganisms, vectors of transmission of disease and pollen and all the other things that make food happen. They witness  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:30):**  this in their day to day and they know that they're a participant in that, they're part of the environment, they're part of the  
**[0:14:36-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:36):**  ecology, but they're not the only thing. So if you're asking, if you're talking to a farmer and he or she says, well, this happened  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:46):**  today on the farm, they already know that all those stories are taking place and interweaving to create the ecology.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:52):**  I always feel like I have nothing to share with someone who has a really close physical contact with food on a day to day basis  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  because they already know this stuff. I think one of the most important things with this project is not talking to people about  
**[0:15:04-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:04):**  their food, but listening to people about their food. The story is a way for the individual to activate his or her own power,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  understanding, knowledge of themselves. When you tell a story, you learn about yourself much more than you learn about  
**[0:15:17-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:17):**  something else. And it's a great way to turn the spotlight back on people who already are experts in their world of food.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:27):**  If you listen to someone, an extraordinary thing happens. I'm slowly learning to get better at not talking. When I listen,  
**[0:15:35-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:35):**  much more happens than I do. If more people do more stuff with food, we're going to get to be a better global community.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:04):**  Earlier this summer, we went along to an intro to Holistic Management at Crune Park. Holistic Management International is an  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:14):**  organization that educates people in regenerative agriculture for healthy land and thriving communities originating from the  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:20):**  ideas of Alan Savery. It provides a framework that allows farmers to make positive decisions that strengthen their business,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:26):**  the environment, and their home lives. Land manager Rob Havard tends around 100 acres of the National Trust parkland,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  moving his 40 cattle across the landscape based on holistic planned grazing techniques. He tells us how Holistic Management  
**[0:16:41-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:41):**  has affected his life. My name is Rob Havard from Havard and Co-Organic Farms. We farm in Worcestershire, 50 acres owned farm at home.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:51):**  We rent another 230 acres off the National Trust. I think the main thing for me is the setting of proper goals that take into account,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:00):**  not just the business side, the economic side, but also the environmental side and the social side. Whether that's family or whatever.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:09):**  It's allowed me to set a goal I can work towards that I can feel good about. I know the decisions I make within that framework,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:17):**  I'm going to be working towards that. All the time I'm testing to make sure I'm moving towards where I want to be on all those  
**[0:17:24-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  different parameters. It's had a big impact for me. It's taught me to make decisions to cut time out and to say no and to really  
**[0:17:33-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  compare what the best option is rather than trying to do all options at once. A couple of things would be, one of them would be  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:42):**  selling the sheep last year. So we swapped them out for store cattle. So just doing the marginal reaction tests within the  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:50):**  management framework wasn't something I was expecting to do, wasn't really something that I wanted to do, but I could see it was  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:56):**  financially better, it was better for my time, more time with the family and it was going to move me closer to my goals.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:02):**  It was a more flexible system for us in terms of the rented farms that we have, integrated better with those as well.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:09):**  So on three fronts it was working better for the business and so we ended up making a decision that worked on all three fronts that  
**[0:18:17-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:17):**  we wouldn't have made if I hadn't done the test. My goal really is to have a multi-generational farming business that really  
**[0:18:26-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  looks after the environment but it also heals our bank account as much as anything else. When you're getting up in the winter  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:34):**  and you're moving stock twice a day in sideways rain you need motivation. I think about my three kids and they're all pretty keen  
**[0:18:41-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:41):**  to take on the business and so every day I get up, that's my motivation to go and move towards that goal of making sure they've got  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:49):**  at least an option to go into the business if they want to. Well they're eight, six and four so they're quite young but they just  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:55):**  love getting involved and they're into everything and I just want to, I was very fortunate to have grown up on a farm and have that  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:02):**  upbringing and I just want to make sure that they've got the option to experience that but also to provide that for their kids.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:10):**  Long time Welsh dairy farmer Will Edwards and his son were also there to learn and share ideas with other livestock farmers.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:18):**  One idea they were particularly excited to share was the simple triple suckling method as a smart way to feed and care for new calves.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:27):**  Hi I'm Will Edwards and we're pasture farmers and we farm dairy cattle and we've started a new herd on the home farm  
**[0:19:39-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:39):**  this year. Because we were starting from fresh we didn't have any calf feeding equipment so instead of going out and buying it  
**[0:19:49-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:49):**  because of dairy austerity we thought we'd try and save some money so I've got a friend that's been multiple suckling his calves  
**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:58):**  on nurse cows. I always noticed that he ended up with really good heifers and really good stock. Mostly I just put a heifer in with  
**[0:20:06-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:06):**  three calves and they would either take to each other straight away or not really and it did help that I would tie my farm dog up  
**[0:20:16-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:16):**  just outside the pen. That seems to sort of conjure up miraculous mothering abilities in heifers. They bonded and after a few days  
**[0:20:25-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:25):**  and everything was settled I would formally tag the calves, disbud them and take them right away from the grazing platform  
**[0:20:36-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  so that neither the calves or the cows were competing with my growing milking herd for resources because grass is very short in the spring  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:48):**  until you get to magic day when you're suddenly instead of looking for grass it's just everywhere. One of the features that we found  
**[0:20:56-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:56):**  was because we were taking pressure off the milking platform it meant that we could make some savings in terms of not feeding concentrate  
**[0:21:06-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  compared to some other similar farms. We did seem to always have a surplus, well I wouldn't say a surplus but a plenty of grass in front of us  
**[0:21:16-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:16):**  and we were able to cut out the concentrate a lot earlier so just feed a minimal amount. So it's the first year I've done it and I'm really pleased  
**[0:21:29-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:29):**  because of the downturn in the payout this year. Whereas we'd budgeted on having a herdsman I decided to do it myself but we still got the other herd  
**[0:21:41-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  to manage as well so I've got to try and keep things very simple. At the same time my neighbour who works on a chicken farm in the morning  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:51):**  he was looking for some work in the afternoon so he was able to come and help me in the afternoon but on a conventional system  
**[0:21:59-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  the calves would be screaming with hunger by then but if I can suckle the calves on cows then everybody's happy.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:09):**  There was one day when we actually forgot about the calves, nobody went to see them or feed them or anything and nothing happened  
**[0:22:17-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:17):**  because they just carried on suckling their foster mothers and the cows didn't manage, didn't mind either because basically feeding calves  
**[0:22:27-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  means just taking a small bag of meal over and feeding it out in some portable troughs for the cows so that they come to you  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  and it just means that when you do want to handle them they're used to following the bit of a rattle of a cake bucket  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:44):**  and that's the only reason they could survive without concentrate but it's just nice to have that close contact with them  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:50):**  so that when you have got to handle them everybody's a bit calmer.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  The 21st to the 23rd November there'll be another introduction to holistic management with a specific focus on financial and grazing planning  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  in Worcestershire again. We'll post a link to it on our Facebook for anyone who's interested.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:07):**  Part of the Slow Food movement is slow fish and a key player in this dialogue is Paul Molyneux, long time fisherman turned journalist.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:15):**  He shared how he's helping to empower fishing communities by giving the young people the tools to share the stories of their families and communities.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  This idea lit up the eyes of fishers from all nations.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:27):**  I was a commercial fisherman for 25 years and I would read what was in the newspapers that people wrote about us  
**[0:23:34-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:34):**  and I said man I've got to tell my story. I was at Slow Fish yesterday and we were talking about what was the most important takeaway from the day's discussions  
**[0:23:46-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:46):**  and one of the things that came up repeatedly was storytelling, connecting, that we get our story out there to people.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:58):**  I was fortunate enough to travel around the world looking at fisheries and I was on the beach in India and the people went down there  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  and they bought fish from the fishermen. Well they didn't need a certification because they knew the story of their food.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:14):**  They knew the man and I saw this in Thorpstrand, Denmark. The boats would come ashore and the people would come with their little plastic bags  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:22):**  down to the side of the boat, hand up money, get bags of fish and they knew the guy. They knew the story of their fish.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:29):**  What certification is, is kind of a corporate tool for, you know, it's a globalization tool in a way,  
**[0:24:39-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  but sometimes fish do have to be exported globally. They've been exported globally for hundreds if not thousands of years.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:50):**  Dried fish has gone all over the world from places where there's lots to places where there's a little.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:56):**  So what the storytelling is a more personal, a personal certification I would say.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:03):**  The thing about that label and those monitoring systems and all that stuff that costs money is it all has to be paid for ultimately with fish,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:11):**  more fish going into whose pockets, not the fish, you know, fisherman's, right?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:18):**  The Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries, we have a program called the Eastern Maine Skippers Program  
**[0:25:24-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:24):**  and it's an education program for the children of fishermen, kids who are sometimes reluctant to engage in the academic  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:32):**  aspects of life because their lives already have meaning on the water.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:38):**  They would rather go fishing and they make sometimes a lot of money at it.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:42):**  What we're doing is reaching out to them and saying, look, as fishermen in the 21st century,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:48):**  you're going to have to be conversant with a lot of skills in order to deal with the management,  
**[0:25:55-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:55):**  in order to deal with competitive industries that also want to invade your, you know, that want to take your ocean.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  We get them together at a cohort day.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:06):**  I showed the students photographs of fishing, which automatically gets their attention.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:12):**  And I asked them to just say one thing that they saw in the photo.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:17):**  Each time that what they noticed got deeper and deeper and they had all of a sudden this group of words.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:24):**  We talked about what was going on and then I did for them a quick workshop on how to mind map,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:32):**  how to organize information and then I asked them to write a caption for the photo, which they all wrote.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:39):**  And their teachers were astounded that these kids had actually written something, that I'd actually tricked them into writing something.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:46):**  They loved it because they were talking about something that was important to them.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:51):**  So now we're amping that up and we're bringing in radio journalists such as yourselves, videographers, TV journalists,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:59):**  reporters to teach media skills to these kids so that these kids can tell their story.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  And so basically we're equipping these kids to tell their story so that it doesn't get spun or reinterpreted by an NGO  
**[0:27:14-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:14):**  that maybe has another agenda or somebody who wants their their their sea bot, you know, their fishing areas for some other other project  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:24):**  and can spin their story. They're going to be equipped to tell their own story and really reach people.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:37):**  Thank you everybody for joining us in Chuin. This is a first for us.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:41):**  We've essentially recorded this episode as live on the day.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  We're going to close with a quote from Carla Petrini, which I think sums up everything that's been going on here.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:52):**  And we'll see you next month.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:28:00):**  They are giants.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:28:02):**  But we are millions.

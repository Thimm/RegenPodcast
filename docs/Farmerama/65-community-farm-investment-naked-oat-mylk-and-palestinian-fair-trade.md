**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:30):**  There have been some heated debates and it has opened up great opportunities for experimentation  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:35):**  in that field.

**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:41):**  of the collective, even if it was to say, I can't seem to get my computer to work  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:45):**  to reply to you properly.

**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:55):**  I'm Tony Allen, I'm an emeritus professor at King's College in London.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:59):**  My interest is in water and in the later part of my life I realized that farmers manage  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:06):**  most water, like 92%, because it's embedded in our food.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:12):**  That water is consumed and goes up into the atmosphere and isn't available locally.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:19):**  The small water which we use at home and in our jobs is used locally and can be reused  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:24):**  locally.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:25):**  But humanity, our markets, our voters are all ignorant of the fact that it's farmers  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:33):**  who manage the water.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:35):**  How have you found the experience so far being part of Arfield?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:39):**  It's been very powerful indeed in that there is a growing need to fill or to link the consumer  
**[0:02:49-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:49):**  with food and the production of food and the devastation that we've wreaked on the environment.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:58):**  Since the farmers are the people that are doing much of the farming in ways which are  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:05):**  not good for the environment, this Arfield process, both as a scientist but mainly as  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:11):**  just a consumer, gives me access to information and the complexities that farmers have to  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:18):**  deal with and have reinforced the impression I had that because they are dealing with something  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:25):**  high risk in economic terms, high risk in environmental terms, the weather in fact,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:30):**  that they do for society a remarkable thing, both production services, ecosystem services,  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:37):**  and the consumers don't understand the risks they take.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:42):**  Most consumers have rather easy lives compared with farmers and we don't appreciate the extraordinary  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:49):**  things they have to deal with.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:50):**  And for some reason we're not prepared to pay the true cost of food.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:54):**  So being involved in the Arfield has helped me have access to farmers, very capable, wonderful  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:02):**  farmers who are dealing with everything, including the relatively small thing which is the water  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:10):**  because the bank and the debts and the weather are so much more vital to them.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:16):**  And do you have any other general comments, suggestions, or feelings about the experience  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:21):**  so far?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:22):**  Yes, as I say, I'm very, very satisfied.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:28):**  One is aware that there are limited resources available.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:32):**  On the other hand, if the experience is to be respected and have an impact because of  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:40):**  the rough and ready way in which the world runs, we need to be able to have statistics,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:48):**  accounting numbers, yield numbers, yield numbers are rather easy, but a whole lot of other  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:52):**  numbers to do with the economics of it, which are very important to would-be emulators on  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:59):**  the farming side as well as on the Arfield type experiment.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:03):**  We need to be able to say what is different as a consequence of engaging in the experiment.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:10):**  It's a very powerful experiment.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:12):**  It's a wonderful way of engaging the consumer.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:15):**  I'm a consumer as well as trying to understand farming in this.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:19):**  So it's a wonderful scientific experiment.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:21):**  It's a wonderful political experiment.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:24):**  But if we can't have some accounting numbers, we will not be able to persuade people that  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:30):**  it's an approach which is good.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:33):**  And we have just been having a discussion there.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:36):**  If we need funds for accounting, as a person, I hate accounts.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:41):**  I hate commoditizing things.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:43):**  I am a socialist, but we run in a world in which we pretend that accounts are important.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:50):**  And if we're to persuade people that work with pretend accounts and are quite happy  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:54):**  to operate with them, we've got somehow to put out numbers in the description and analysis  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:00):**  that we have that get people's attention.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:07):**  Thank you for all your support and great work, Tony.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:10):**  Your legacy lives on.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:18):**  The Kindling Trust in Manchester work on a range of projects that model a fairer, more  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:22):**  responsible, ecologically restorative food system.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:26):**  Their projects range from developing markets for sustainable locally grown food to training  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:31):**  people in farm work.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:32):**  They're now looking to set up their own community farm.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:36):**  So we've just been looking at ways to make local sustainable food more accessible and  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:41):**  affordable to people, but then also finding ways for people to have livelihoods in regenerative  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:48):**  agriculture.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:49):**  So kind of we've been trying to work at both ends of the supply chain with farmers and  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:54):**  with consumers.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:55):**  And yeah, Kindling Trust is really about balancing that supply and demand.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:00):**  And now we're ready to establish a kindling farm.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:05):**  And we need to scale up.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:08):**  Like we've done loads of amazing stuff happening up here in terms of veg box people and Manchester  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:15):**  veg people and growing the markets for local organic food.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:20):**  So partly Kindling Farm is about that.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:22):**  It's about growing more produce more locally for our customers.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:29):**  But it's also about looking at looking at how to farm truly ecologically on a bit of  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:35):**  a larger scale.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:36):**  So yeah, Kindling Farm is kind of about engaging more people.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:40):**  It's about training more people and it's about growing more food and growing hope, like growing  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:47):**  the hope that we can do things in a different way.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:51):**  Currently we are we've launched a community share campaign to buy a 120 acre farm close  
**[0:08:01-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:01):**  to Manchester to create a agroforestry pioneering agroforestry farm for the northwest.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:10):**  The vast majority of the farm will be focused on field scale, fruit, veg and cereals and  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:17):**  pulses.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:18):**  The agroforestry system will have around 6000 apple and pear trees and then we'll also be  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:23):**  growing undercover.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:25):**  So salads and the like for our markets in Greater Manchester.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:29):**  And then in the future, we hope to have a space for people to kind of add value to the  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:34):**  products.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:35):**  So enterprise hub and maybe a centre for social change where people can come and learn the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:40):**  kind of lessons and the mistakes that we've made whilst establishing this agroforestry  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:44):**  farm.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:45):**  So the approach we're taking to establish the farm is to run a community shares offer  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:50):**  and that does a couple of things.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:52):**  It engages a really broad range of people in kind of owning the farm and really raises  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:00):**  our profile and also helps us raise money because, you know, purchasing land is really  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:06):**  expensive and really difficult to do.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:09):**  So what we're doing between now and the 3rd of July is encouraging people to go and look  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:14):**  at our plans, look at our business plan, look at the offer and see whether they would like  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:18):**  to kind of join us in establishing the farm.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:22):**  And then because of the way it's been run and the people involved, you kind of at the  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:27):**  end of it, you end up with this kind of community of owners and this democratic process.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:32):**  So as Chris says, we want as many people to be involved as possible and we're aware that  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:37):**  in these quite uncertain times, not everyone feels they've got enough money to invest.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:44):**  So there's a couple of things.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:45):**  One thing is that you can get together with a group of people to invest.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:49):**  So whether that's your family or your friends or a coffee morning that you're part of or  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:53):**  something and you can invest as that group and just name an individual to be a representative  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:59):**  or you can buy it as a present for a child.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:02):**  Like I had a phone call the other day from somebody who was a grandma and wanted to buy  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:08):**  shares for three of her grandchildren because she felt like it was a really hopeful present  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:14):**  to give them, especially at this time.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:17):**  And then the other thing is if you can't afford it, then we want you to be able to get involved  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:22):**  in other ways.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:23):**  Like at the moment, we've got 12,000 trees that we need to graft for our agroforestry  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:28):**  system.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:29):**  And we're doing that through also training people up and trying to pass those skills  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:34):**  on.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:35):**  So if people would rather do that or feel more able to do that, then we would really  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:40):**  love for you to get involved in that way.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:42):**  And also just to help us spread the word about what we're doing and about the community shares  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:47):**  and the kindling farm.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:49):**  For us, it's really important that we show that almost anyone without any money behind  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:56):**  them can come together and find a way of getting onto the land.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:01):**  There are some fantastic examples out there of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:06):**  Very often it's very difficult to see how as an individual I could go about and replicating  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:11):**  that and setting that up.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:12):**  And we need these kinds of farms almost everywhere.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:15):**  So we need examples of lots of different ways that these things can be established.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:19):**  And for us, being able to show that a group of people can come together without any resources  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:26):**  at the outset, but pooling their expertise and finances can establish these projects  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:33):**  is as important as actually the food we end up growing at the end.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:37):**  Over the last year or so, I've seen this change in the organization where years ago we felt  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:43):**  that we wanted to do something around food justice and we felt that we needed to establish  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:47):**  a farm.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:48):**  And so we set up all of these projects to help us get to that point and to help us.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:53):**  We knew that if we established a farm way back then, it would struggle.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:57):**  We didn't have the volunteers, we didn't have the market, we didn't have the expertise.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:01):**  So we have, as an organization, spent the last five, 10 years kind of developing these  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:06):**  projects to support the farm.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:08):**  But in the last year or two, particularly with COVID, there's kind of been this kind  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:12):**  of flip where actually the projects need the farm to grow.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:16):**  So like our veg box collection point, our veg box collection co-op has got to that stage  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:22):**  now where it needs more local produce.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:24):**  We have more volunteers and we can safely look after a smaller site.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:32):**  Really fascinating to watch.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:34):**  If you'd like to find out more about the share offer or consider investing, you can do so  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:38):**  at ethics.org.uk.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:41):**  That's E-T-H-E-X dot org dot UK.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:51):**  John Turner and his brother have a 130 acre farm in Northamptonshire.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:55):**  John is actually one of the original Pasture for Life farmers and has been producing organic  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:00):**  Pasture for Life beef for many years.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:03):**  But his children have led him to move in a different direction recently.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:07):**  John shares some of his explorations of how he can marry the ethics of his vegetarian  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:12):**  and vegan children with a profitable farming enterprise that nourishes people and the soil.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:18):**  He is proposing a vegetarian dairy farm, producing cow's milk alongside innovative naked oat  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:24):**  milk.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:25):**  John begins by telling us how they got started dairy farming back in the 1960s.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:33):**  In those days, dairy was a really good entry point for farmers to get into farming.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:40):**  And ironically, you could actually make a good living off 10 cows in those days.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:45):**  It seemed just natural to keep developing that and we ended up at a point, we were up  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:49):**  to about 110 cows.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:52):**  It was starting to put significant pressure on the farm.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:57):**  We felt we were pushing the cows, we were having to feed them a little bit more, we  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:02):**  were dealing with farming problems, book problems, that sort of thing.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:09):**  And so we took a long hard look at it, looked at all the various options.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:14):**  We went to a higher value product at the time, which was organic.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:20):**  And I'll put my hands up, that was the reason we went into organics was really just to tap  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:26):**  into a higher value market.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:28):**  Once we're in there, it sort of completely changed the way we looked at farming.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:33):**  It's the point at which I say to people, we actually started farming at that point.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:38):**  The whole sort of approach of looking at the causes of problems rather than dealing with  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:44):**  the symptoms, that was the big shift for us.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:47):**  The problem was that shortly after we converted, the organic milk price absolutely collapsed.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:52):**  It plummeted to the point where we started off with four cows in an old farm because  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:59):**  we were just losing money at that sort of rate.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:02):**  So it was a big wrench for the family, particularly my father, just to say, Dave is going to have  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:08):**  to go.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:09):**  And so we did and went into suckler beef with these Limousin Cross British region animals.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:16):**  We had all this grassland, so we just let them get out, go and do the grazing.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:22):**  The trouble is that going into beef took us into another different area, another challenge  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:26):**  for me.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:27):**  We have four children.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:28):**  And out of those four children, I have got two that are vegetarian and one that is vegan.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:34):**  So becoming a beef farmer was, in some ways, we had solved some problems.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:44):**  We were getting all this thing about sustainable farming and starting to realize the huge benefits  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:50):**  in terms of what they did to the soil.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:53):**  And it was taking us in the wrong direction in terms of where I saw the next generation  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:59):**  and those values, those ethics.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:01):**  What is the legacy farming that we want to leave for the next generation?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:05):**  And they've taken a fairly fundamental decision for us.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:09):**  And this time, the change isn't because of finances.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:13):**  The organic beef is doing incredibly well for us.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:15):**  But we've taken the decision that they're going to move on to another pasture-fed farm.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:20):**  And in the place, we are creating a space for microdairy to come onto the farm.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:26):**  And that would be the Ahimsa dairy.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:29):**  And they're lovely people.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:31):**  It's a microdairy.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:32):**  But bolted onto that is the added thing that it's a no slaughtered area.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:37):**  In other words, there's no part of the production, including the calves, where the animals end  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:43):**  up being used for meat.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:45):**  I think what we want to do is to try and explore what that would look like, how it would work,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:52):**  the idea of a vegetarian livestock-based enterprise on the farm.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:58):**  Ironically, we've come full circle.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:01):**  2021, we're 13 milking cows on the farm.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:06):**  And we're almost back to where we were in the 1960s.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:10):**  But I just feel that the whole values and the reason that we are in this position embraces  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:18):**  so much about regenerative agriculture, the role of livestock.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:23):**  And it's resetting, I think, our relationship with livestock on the farm.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:31):**  Could this farm actually run without livestock on it?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:36):**  Quite clearly, the answer to that was a definite no.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:39):**  There's times on the farm where we have established new lays or we've put a crop in.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:44):**  And they've not got going.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:46):**  They've not responded in the way.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:49):**  And it's very difficult to put your finger on why they haven't worked.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:52):**  And it's happened so many times.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:54):**  Even though there are a few weeds and straggly bits, and it's probably only enough for a  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:58):**  couple of days grazing, we put the cows on them.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:02):**  And there's been this absolute transformative effect on it.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:06):**  It's just like waving a magic wand.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:07):**  And the whole thing comes to life.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:10):**  And all those plants that you thought weren't viable, all of them spring up.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:14):**  And it's funny, because this is the point at which science, you can't Google what's  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:19):**  happening there.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:20):**  You find yourself talking to other farms and saying, what do you think is happening?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:24):**  And it's one of those light bulb moments.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:26):**  Somebody said to me, you know what, John?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:28):**  I think it's because you've got a crazy animal here.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:31):**  So the biology in the cow's rumen is going to be the same as what it's eating, which  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:37):**  is the grass.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:39):**  And there's this virtual circle that that's the same biology that's in the soil bio.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:45):**  And that, to me, although I don't have the science to back it up, that seems to me to  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:51):**  be the answer.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:52):**  That you've got this fantastic symbiotic relationship between the bacteria in the gut, the bacteria  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:59):**  in the soil.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:00):**  And that is where the real benefit is.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:02):**  What we're doing is giving it that sort of yakult effect within the soil's stomach.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:07):**  And it's seeding the right biology.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:10):**  It starts feeding the plant roots.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:13):**  And you get all those benefits.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:15):**  We must have cattle on the farm.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:19):**  It's just the role of those cattle.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:20):**  And I think the transformation for us is going from seeing the cattle as a financial model  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:27):**  to the cattle in terms of their value, in terms of what they do, they bring in terms  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:32):**  of the grazing, the management, and the soil biology.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:36):**  That's the value of having the cattle on the farm.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:39):**  Instead of looking at the manure in terms of tons of manure, like we need so many tons  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:44):**  of nitrogen, so many tons of phosphorus to grow this particular crop, we're now looking  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:48):**  at it in a very different way that actually is more like a team using that manure in a  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:53):**  very strategic way to feed the bacteria.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:56):**  So we can actually do what we're doing with 13 cows.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:00):**  We don't need the volumes.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:02):**  All we need is that little magic element.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:05):**  And that's what's making our organic rotation work incredibly well.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:10):**  Getting rid of the beef herd, it's left a huge hole in terms of an income.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:16):**  So we have to make sure that the farm stays viable.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:19):**  One of the take home quotes from one of the Oxford Real Farm conferences a couple of years  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:24):**  ago was, you can't be green if you're in the red.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:27):**  You've got to have a viable farming business.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:31):**  When we were introduced to Naked Oats, we sat around the table with Kim up at Small

**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:42):**  diets.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:43):**  It was one of those moments when everything just seemed to drop into place.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:46):**  Here was a potential big crop, and it was a part of the rotation.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:52):**  For us, once you've taken the first wheat crop off, you're looking for other things

**[0:26:17-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:26:17):**  They are producing olive oil and other products such as wheat, za'atar or thyme.

**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:29):**  cover your own home consumption needs.

**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:40):**  Then the extra quantity will be let's say marketed through us or through other traders,  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:46):**  maybe locally trading.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:48):**  It's important to have two things in your home, in your house for your living.

**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:57):**  So we say saba'ayn fil bayt, tahin w'zayt.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:03):**  Of course they are small scale farmers, they don't have that much land they own but they  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:10):**  produce enough quantities to be marketed through our organization or through our channel or  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:17):**  even through other traders, maybe locally.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:23):**  When we started in 2005, of course, mainly all the farmers joined the system because

**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:37):**  Now they are with us not just because the marketing but also they now believe that they  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:41):**  are producing healthy food and they are contributing, which is very important for us as Palestinians  
**[0:28:49-0:28:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:49):**  under occupation, we are contributing with other countries in order to save our planet,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:59):**  in order to make a better, healthy life.

**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:20):**  30 or 40 years ago there was no chemicals.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:24):**  Maybe the intensive farming start maybe 40 or 45 years ago.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:28):**  So there was no intensive farming, there was no conventional farming, mainly the farmers  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:32):**  are organic.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:36):**  Traditionally our farmers use the animal manure as an organic fertilizer which came from extensive  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:42):**  farms, not intensive farms, from their own animals.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:46):**  Also they can, let's say, do weeding by hand so they don't need to spray pesticides, herbicides,  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:55):**  sorry.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:56):**  And sometimes they plant some trees or some crops which can affect, let's say, keep the  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:05):**  insects or the pests away from your major crop.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:09):**  For example, sometimes they plant garlic or onion or sometimes basil between the vegetables  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:17):**  and this gives a good result in order to keep the insects away from your vegetables or from  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:25):**  your field.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:26):**  We start talking with them about something new and not new.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:31):**  It's something new as a name, but it's not new as practices.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:37):**  Some farmers they believe as much as you blow your land, as much you will get production.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:46):**  Of course it's something, it's wrong.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:48):**  So other farmers they believe that they need to do just one blowing time which is on the  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:55):**  spring.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:56):**  So it's accepted on the regenerative farming limit tillage or limit blowing.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:04):**  So maybe we start with 30 or 35 farmers.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:09):**  They establish a connection between them to share experience and also to share other things  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:16):**  such as the machinery or the machines, some seeds, some land-based seeds which is very  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:24):**  important in the regenerative farming.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:29):**  They establish a kind of seed span or library for the seeds.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:35):**  The farmers they produce their own organic land-based seeds which is of course pure seeds,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:43):**  not genetically modified, not treated.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:48):**  The farmer for example, one farmer produce clover.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:52):**  So next year part of the store, the quantity from last year from the clover seeds will  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:58):**  be distributed to other farmers.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:01):**  The other farmers for example have their own beans or legumes, let's say beans or fava beans.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:07):**  So he will share the quantity with other farmers and so on.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:12):**  The alternatives for us it's very limited because in Palestine we don't have access  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:19):**  for our groundwater, for the ground aquifers because it's controlled by the Israelis.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:25):**  So even if we try to find alternative, it's limited.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:32):**  So we are not able to dig wells for example to irrigate our crops.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:40):**  Even if some of the farmers dig a well which is considered for the Israelis as illegal  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:46):**  well, if they discover they will directly come and destroy the well and he will be.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:52):**  So we start doing cover cropping.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:56):**  Cover cropping, let's say has two functions.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:02):**  The first one it's a cover.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:04):**  So it's a green cover for the soil.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:06):**  This will reduce the evaporation or the loss of the moisture during summer.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:11):**  And in the other hand it's doing a kind of do harvest.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:15):**  So in the early morning every day we have to do and of course due to the condensation  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:23):**  so we have water.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:25):**  So due to the ground gravity or the earth gravity this will go directly to the upper  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:31):**  part of the soil and this will make a kind of daily irrigation for the cover crop.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:37):**  And also on the other hand the cover crop will reduce the evaporation or reduce the  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:41):**  effect of the sunlight during summer on the soil.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:47):**  We are sharing, all of us sharing this world.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:49):**  We are all of us sharing this planet.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:52):**  And we need to work all of us together.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:55):**  It's not enough for, I'm talking about farming even, it's not enough to work environmentally  
**[0:34:05-0:34:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:05):**  friendly in order to have a better environment or more healthy environment.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:13):**  We need to work all of us together.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:16):**  You as a customer in United Kingdom for example or any place in the world, when you choose  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:22):**  this product which was produced under organic or native farming this will help the farmers  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:29):**  or the producers to continue to be more resilient for what's happening, for the climate change,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:37):**  for all these challenges which is very important.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:40):**  So I think we need all of us to work together at all levels in order to help to protect  
**[0:34:49-0:34:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:49):**  our planet, our environment because we don't know what's coming in the future.

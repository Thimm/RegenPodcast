**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  This month we start with a fond farewell to internationally renowned water specialist  Professor Tony Allen.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:00:14):**  We hear from the Kindling Trust, who are opening up an opportunity to invest in their new farming  endeavours in Manchester.  Farmer John Turner explores a new vision for dairy farming and introduces us to naked oat  
**[0:00:24-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:00:24):**  milk.  And finally we meet Mohamed Rouzi, a fair trade farmer in Palestine, about the role  of regenerative farming and the Zeytun cooperative in supporting a better life for Palestinian  
**[0:00:35-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:00:35):**  farmers.  Professor Tony Allen was an eminent scholar, most noted for his pioneering work on the  concept of virtual water, including the importance of water embedded in our food systems.  
**[0:00:49-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:00:49):**  Tony received the highly prestigious Stockholm Water Prize in 2008, amongst many other accolades.  Sadly, Tony passed away earlier this month and we wanted to take some time to celebrate  his wonderful contributions and to say thank you to someone who has always been a great  
**[0:01:05-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:05):**  support of what we are doing.  We got to know Tony when he became a member of the Arfield collective.  Arfield has been going since 2017, when 60 people co-invested in growing a 28 acre field  
**[0:01:18-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:18):**  of grains on John Cherry's farm in Hertfordshire.  The collective makes decisions together online and has farm gatherings to learn more about  some of those decisions.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:30):**  There have been some heated debates and it has opened up great opportunities for experimentation  in that field.  Tony was always the first person to respond to any contributions from John or members  
**[0:01:41-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:41):**  of the collective, even if it was to say, I can't seem to get my computer to work  to reply to you properly.  We spoke to Tony about Arfield as it was just getting going back in 2017.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:01:55):**  I'm Tony Allen, I'm an emeritus professor at King's College in London.  My interest is in water and in the later part of my life I realized that farmers manage  most water, like 92%, because it's embedded in our food.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:12):**  That water is consumed and goes up into the atmosphere and isn't available locally.  The small water which we use at home and in our jobs is used locally and can be reused  locally.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:25):**  But humanity, our markets, our voters are all ignorant of the fact that it's farmers  who manage the water.  How have you found the experience so far being part of Arfield?  
**[0:02:39-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:02:39):**  It's been very powerful indeed in that there is a growing need to fill or to link the consumer  with food and the production of food and the devastation that we've wreaked on the environment.  Since the farmers are the people that are doing much of the farming in ways which are  
**[0:03:05-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:05):**  not good for the environment, this Arfield process, both as a scientist but mainly as  just a consumer, gives me access to information and the complexities that farmers have to  deal with and have reinforced the impression I had that because they are dealing with something  
**[0:03:25-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:25):**  high risk in economic terms, high risk in environmental terms, the weather in fact,  that they do for society a remarkable thing, both production services, ecosystem services,  and the consumers don't understand the risks they take.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:42):**  Most consumers have rather easy lives compared with farmers and we don't appreciate the extraordinary  things they have to deal with.  And for some reason we're not prepared to pay the true cost of food.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:03:54):**  So being involved in the Arfield has helped me have access to farmers, very capable, wonderful  farmers who are dealing with everything, including the relatively small thing which is the water  because the bank and the debts and the weather are so much more vital to them.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:16):**  And do you have any other general comments, suggestions, or feelings about the experience  so far?  Yes, as I say, I'm very, very satisfied.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:28):**  One is aware that there are limited resources available.  On the other hand, if the experience is to be respected and have an impact because of  the rough and ready way in which the world runs, we need to be able to have statistics,  
**[0:04:48-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:04:48):**  accounting numbers, yield numbers, yield numbers are rather easy, but a whole lot of other  numbers to do with the economics of it, which are very important to would-be emulators on  the farming side as well as on the Arfield type experiment.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:03):**  We need to be able to say what is different as a consequence of engaging in the experiment.  It's a very powerful experiment.  It's a wonderful way of engaging the consumer.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:15):**  I'm a consumer as well as trying to understand farming in this.  So it's a wonderful scientific experiment.  It's a wonderful political experiment.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:24):**  But if we can't have some accounting numbers, we will not be able to persuade people that  it's an approach which is good.  And we have just been having a discussion there.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:36):**  If we need funds for accounting, as a person, I hate accounts.  I hate commoditizing things.  I am a socialist, but we run in a world in which we pretend that accounts are important.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:05:50):**  And if we're to persuade people that work with pretend accounts and are quite happy  to operate with them, we've got somehow to put out numbers in the description and analysis  that we have that get people's attention.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:07):**  Thank you for all your support and great work, Tony.  Your legacy lives on.  The Kindling Trust in Manchester work on a range of projects that model a fairer, more  
**[0:06:22-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:22):**  responsible, ecologically restorative food system.  Their projects range from developing markets for sustainable locally grown food to training  people in farm work.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:32):**  They're now looking to set up their own community farm.  So we've just been looking at ways to make local sustainable food more accessible and  affordable to people, but then also finding ways for people to have livelihoods in regenerative  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:48):**  agriculture.  So kind of we've been trying to work at both ends of the supply chain with farmers and  with consumers.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:06:55):**  And yeah, Kindling Trust is really about balancing that supply and demand.  And now we're ready to establish a kindling farm.  And we need to scale up.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:08):**  Like we've done loads of amazing stuff happening up here in terms of veg box people and Manchester  veg people and growing the markets for local organic food.  So partly Kindling Farm is about that.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:22):**  It's about growing more produce more locally for our customers.  But it's also about looking at looking at how to farm truly ecologically on a bit of  a larger scale.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:36):**  So yeah, Kindling Farm is kind of about engaging more people.  It's about training more people and it's about growing more food and growing hope, like growing  the hope that we can do things in a different way.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:07:51):**  Currently we are we've launched a community share campaign to buy a 120 acre farm close  to Manchester to create a agroforestry pioneering agroforestry farm for the northwest.  The vast majority of the farm will be focused on field scale, fruit, veg and cereals and  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:17):**  pulses.  The agroforestry system will have around 6000 apple and pear trees and then we'll also be  growing undercover.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:25):**  So salads and the like for our markets in Greater Manchester.  And then in the future, we hope to have a space for people to kind of add value to the  products.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:35):**  So enterprise hub and maybe a centre for social change where people can come and learn the  kind of lessons and the mistakes that we've made whilst establishing this agroforestry  farm.  
**[0:08:45-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:08:45):**  So the approach we're taking to establish the farm is to run a community shares offer  and that does a couple of things.  It engages a really broad range of people in kind of owning the farm and really raises  
**[0:09:00-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:00):**  our profile and also helps us raise money because, you know, purchasing land is really  expensive and really difficult to do.  So what we're doing between now and the 3rd of July is encouraging people to go and look  
**[0:09:14-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:14):**  at our plans, look at our business plan, look at the offer and see whether they would like  to kind of join us in establishing the farm.  And then because of the way it's been run and the people involved, you kind of at the  
**[0:09:27-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:27):**  end of it, you end up with this kind of community of owners and this democratic process.  So as Chris says, we want as many people to be involved as possible and we're aware that  in these quite uncertain times, not everyone feels they've got enough money to invest.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:44):**  So there's a couple of things.  One thing is that you can get together with a group of people to invest.  So whether that's your family or your friends or a coffee morning that you're part of or  
**[0:09:53-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:09:53):**  something and you can invest as that group and just name an individual to be a representative  or you can buy it as a present for a child.  Like I had a phone call the other day from somebody who was a grandma and wanted to buy  
**[0:10:08-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:08):**  shares for three of her grandchildren because she felt like it was a really hopeful present  to give them, especially at this time.  And then the other thing is if you can't afford it, then we want you to be able to get involved  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:22):**  in other ways.  Like at the moment, we've got 12,000 trees that we need to graft for our agroforestry  system.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:29):**  And we're doing that through also training people up and trying to pass those skills  on.  So if people would rather do that or feel more able to do that, then we would really  
**[0:10:40-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:40):**  love for you to get involved in that way.  And also just to help us spread the word about what we're doing and about the community shares  and the kindling farm.  
**[0:10:49-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:10:49):**  For us, it's really important that we show that almost anyone without any money behind  them can come together and find a way of getting onto the land.  There are some fantastic examples out there of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:06):**  Very often it's very difficult to see how as an individual I could go about and replicating  that and setting that up.  And we need these kinds of farms almost everywhere.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:15):**  So we need examples of lots of different ways that these things can be established.  And for us, being able to show that a group of people can come together without any resources  at the outset, but pooling their expertise and finances can establish these projects  
**[0:11:33-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:33):**  is as important as actually the food we end up growing at the end.  Over the last year or so, I've seen this change in the organization where years ago we felt  that we wanted to do something around food justice and we felt that we needed to establish  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:47):**  a farm.  And so we set up all of these projects to help us get to that point and to help us.  We knew that if we established a farm way back then, it would struggle.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:11:57):**  We didn't have the volunteers, we didn't have the market, we didn't have the expertise.  So we have, as an organization, spent the last five, 10 years kind of developing these  projects to support the farm.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:08):**  But in the last year or two, particularly with COVID, there's kind of been this kind  of flip where actually the projects need the farm to grow.  So like our veg box collection point, our veg box collection co-op has got to that stage  
**[0:12:22-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:22):**  now where it needs more local produce.  We have more volunteers and we can safely look after a smaller site.  Really fascinating to watch.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:34):**  If you'd like to find out more about the share offer or consider investing, you can do so  at ethics.org.uk.  That's E-T-H-E-X dot org dot UK.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:12:51):**  John Turner and his brother have a 130 acre farm in Northamptonshire.  John is actually one of the original Pasture for Life farmers and has been producing organic  Pasture for Life beef for many years.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:03):**  But his children have led him to move in a different direction recently.  John shares some of his explorations of how he can marry the ethics of his vegetarian  and vegan children with a profitable farming enterprise that nourishes people and the soil.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:18):**  He is proposing a vegetarian dairy farm, producing cow's milk alongside innovative naked oat  milk.  John begins by telling us how they got started dairy farming back in the 1960s.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:33):**  In those days, dairy was a really good entry point for farmers to get into farming.  And ironically, you could actually make a good living off 10 cows in those days.  It seemed just natural to keep developing that and we ended up at a point, we were up  
**[0:13:49-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:13:49):**  to about 110 cows.  It was starting to put significant pressure on the farm.  We felt we were pushing the cows, we were having to feed them a little bit more, we  
**[0:14:02-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:02):**  were dealing with farming problems, book problems, that sort of thing.  And so we took a long hard look at it, looked at all the various options.  We went to a higher value product at the time, which was organic.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:20):**  And I'll put my hands up, that was the reason we went into organics was really just to tap  into a higher value market.  Once we're in there, it sort of completely changed the way we looked at farming.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:33):**  It's the point at which I say to people, we actually started farming at that point.  The whole sort of approach of looking at the causes of problems rather than dealing with  the symptoms, that was the big shift for us.  
**[0:14:47-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:14:47):**  The problem was that shortly after we converted, the organic milk price absolutely collapsed.  It plummeted to the point where we started off with four cows in an old farm because  we were just losing money at that sort of rate.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:02):**  So it was a big wrench for the family, particularly my father, just to say, Dave is going to have  to go.  And so we did and went into suckler beef with these Limousin Cross British region animals.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:16):**  We had all this grassland, so we just let them get out, go and do the grazing.  The trouble is that going into beef took us into another different area, another challenge  for me.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:27):**  We have four children.  And out of those four children, I have got two that are vegetarian and one that is vegan.  So becoming a beef farmer was, in some ways, we had solved some problems.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:44):**  We were getting all this thing about sustainable farming and starting to realize the huge benefits  in terms of what they did to the soil.  And it was taking us in the wrong direction in terms of where I saw the next generation  
**[0:15:59-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:15:59):**  and those values, those ethics.  What is the legacy farming that we want to leave for the next generation?  And they've taken a fairly fundamental decision for us.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:09):**  And this time, the change isn't because of finances.  The organic beef is doing incredibly well for us.  But we've taken the decision that they're going to move on to another pasture-fed farm.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:20):**  And in the place, we are creating a space for microdairy to come onto the farm.  And that would be the Ahimsa dairy.  And they're lovely people.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:31):**  It's a microdairy.  But bolted onto that is the added thing that it's a no slaughtered area.  In other words, there's no part of the production, including the calves, where the animals end  
**[0:16:43-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:43):**  up being used for meat.  I think what we want to do is to try and explore what that would look like, how it would work,  the idea of a vegetarian livestock-based enterprise on the farm.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:16:58):**  Ironically, we've come full circle.  2021, we're 13 milking cows on the farm.  And we're almost back to where we were in the 1960s.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:10):**  But I just feel that the whole values and the reason that we are in this position embraces  so much about regenerative agriculture, the role of livestock.  And it's resetting, I think, our relationship with livestock on the farm.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:31):**  Could this farm actually run without livestock on it?  Quite clearly, the answer to that was a definite no.  There's times on the farm where we have established new lays or we've put a crop in.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:44):**  And they've not got going.  They've not responded in the way.  And it's very difficult to put your finger on why they haven't worked.  
**[0:17:52-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:17:52):**  And it's happened so many times.  Even though there are a few weeds and straggly bits, and it's probably only enough for a  couple of days grazing, we put the cows on them.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:02):**  And there's been this absolute transformative effect on it.  It's just like waving a magic wand.  And the whole thing comes to life.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:10):**  And all those plants that you thought weren't viable, all of them spring up.  And it's funny, because this is the point at which science, you can't Google what's  happening there.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:20):**  You find yourself talking to other farms and saying, what do you think is happening?  And it's one of those light bulb moments.  Somebody said to me, you know what, John?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:28):**  I think it's because you've got a crazy animal here.  So the biology in the cow's rumen is going to be the same as what it's eating, which  is the grass.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:39):**  And there's this virtual circle that that's the same biology that's in the soil bio.  And that, to me, although I don't have the science to back it up, that seems to me to  be the answer.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:18:52):**  That you've got this fantastic symbiotic relationship between the bacteria in the gut, the bacteria  in the soil.  And that is where the real benefit is.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:02):**  What we're doing is giving it that sort of yakult effect within the soil's stomach.  And it's seeding the right biology.  It starts feeding the plant roots.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:13):**  And you get all those benefits.  We must have cattle on the farm.  It's just the role of those cattle.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:20):**  And I think the transformation for us is going from seeing the cattle as a financial model  to the cattle in terms of their value, in terms of what they do, they bring in terms  of the grazing, the management, and the soil biology.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:36):**  That's the value of having the cattle on the farm.  Instead of looking at the manure in terms of tons of manure, like we need so many tons  of nitrogen, so many tons of phosphorus to grow this particular crop, we're now looking  
**[0:19:48-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:19:48):**  at it in a very different way that actually is more like a team using that manure in a  very strategic way to feed the bacteria.  So we can actually do what we're doing with 13 cows.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:00):**  We don't need the volumes.  All we need is that little magic element.  And that's what's making our organic rotation work incredibly well.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:10):**  Getting rid of the beef herd, it's left a huge hole in terms of an income.  So we have to make sure that the farm stays viable.  One of the take home quotes from one of the Oxford Real Farm conferences a couple of years  
**[0:20:24-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:24):**  ago was, you can't be green if you're in the red.  You've got to have a viable farming business.  When we were introduced to Naked Oats, we sat around the table with Kim up at Small  
**[0:20:36-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:36):**  Food Bakery, and I think Josiah from Hogmedance had brought up a little jar of these oaky  diets.  It was one of those moments when everything just seemed to drop into place.  
**[0:20:46-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:20:46):**  Here was a potential big crop, and it was a part of the rotation.  For us, once you've taken the first wheat crop off, you're looking for other things  that don't have a big demand on the soil.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:21:00):**  Otherwise, you're just going to impoverish the soil.  The notes have been a really good crop, but here was a crop that potentially was a food  crop and it ticked all the boxes for us in terms of feeding people.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:21:14):**  It's a food that needs minimal processing.  I think the problem with conventional oats is that they do need the husks taken off.  Well, here was something you could use straight out of the jar, and it was almost a direct  
**[0:21:26-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:21:26):**  replacement for rice.  Also, increasingly, in the interest in oat milk and plant-based alternatives.  For us, it fills a financial gap that has been left by beef.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:21:40):**  This is where that relationship with people like Hogmedance, who are so fantastic at facilitating  the development of these new crops, and they're working with people like Joshua down at Tiger  Milk in Bristol.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:21:57):**  It started off with milk being produced from tiger nuts, but they produced this new one,  which is called Float.  That is an oat milk based on a very different oatmeal approach using naked oats into bottles,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:22:14):**  recyclable, local, to see the oats that we produced going through a chain and ending  up in a product.  We can say, yeah, we know where that's come from, such a difference for us as farming.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:22:29):**  It makes such a difference to see the effort that we put into it ending up in a product  and people appreciating it.  Yeah, there's some wonderful opportunities out there.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:22:40):**  All the energy that's coming out of regenerative farming now and the alternative food networks,  it's such a great time to be starting in farming.  Just stage your app, I don't think they should be quite making change.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:22:54):**  The number of people I've spoken to, particularly when the subject of oat milk comes up, they  do clearly see it as a threat and retreats, well, I'm a dairy producer, how does that  fit in with what I'm trying to do?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:23:06):**  My response is actually don't see it as a threat.  If you've got a dairy farm that can grow barley, you can grow oats, and you can do both.  You can put your cows onto grass and do some fantastic pasture for life milk and grow oats  
**[0:23:21-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:23:21):**  and supply plant-based milk.  It's not an either or, let's get away from this binary choice.  There's a world of opportunity out there for people and I'd say just embrace those opportunities.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:23:36):**  Bristol based Tiger and Float are making this innovative oat milk that uses the naked oats  John is growing.  It's exciting on many levels because it embraces ecological farming methods and creates a whole  
**[0:23:47-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:23:47):**  new model for oat milk that can support local farmers and works with recyclable glass bottles  instead of the current international tetrapak centralised oat milk model.  On their website they say that Float tastes more naturally milky than anything else out  
**[0:24:02-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:24:02):**  there and can make anything from frothy cappuccinos to thick smoothies.  We can't wait to try it.  Mohammed Roozy is a farmer and manager of the Palestine Fair Trade Association, a group  
**[0:24:20-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:24:20):**  of farming cooperatives who supply their olive oil, almonds and wheat to the UK based cooperative  Zeytun.  For almost 20 years Zeytun have sourced products that are ethically sourced and sustainably  
**[0:24:31-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:24:31):**  grown in Palestine and they can be bought in the UK to support sustainable livelihoods  for farming communities in Palestine.  This is a great example of solidarity trade.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:24:41):**  Mohammed believes that regenerative farming and traditional knowledge are vital in response  to climate change and the added challenges faced by Palestinians due to the occupation.  So I will just go out.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:24:58):**  Good afternoon from Palestine.  My name is Mohammed Roozy working with the Palestine Fair Trade Association as a union  or a pool for all the Palestinian farmers or producers who are interested to work under  
**[0:25:20-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:25:20):**  the fair trade umbrella.  Anyway so if you see the mountains that is Nazareth.  It's very far, it's around 35 kilometres from here but I think we can see it.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:25:38):**  And this area called Marj Ibn Amer area, it was considered as the food basket for Orbal  style.  Okay I'll go back inside.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:25:58):**  We have 1200 farmers registered in our system and they are let's say from around 50 cooperatives  in the West Bank in the occupied Palestinian territories.  All of them are both certified fair trade and organic farmers.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:26:17):**  They are producing olive oil and other products such as wheat, za'atar or thyme.  So here in Palestine mainly we inherit the farming work from our families.  So even if you are not a full time farmer, your family is a farmer.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:26:49):**  Mainly we work with organic farmers.  Our organic farmers as I mentioned in the beginning they are olive and almond farmers.  It's not easy to be organic but it's not very difficult.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:05):**  Organic not just healthy food, organic means healthy environment, better environment for  us.  We can find always healthy food but also we need a healthy environment to have a healthy  
**[0:27:21-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:21):**  life.  In our system or let's say in Palestine in general, the most important thing that you  cover your own home consumption needs.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:32):**  So at the first level you need to produce the needed quantity for your family.  Then the extra quantity will be let's say marketed through us or through other traders,  maybe locally trading.  
**[0:27:48-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:27:48):**  It's important to have two things in your home, in your house for your living.  The oil and the wheat.  So we say saba'ayn fil bayt, tahin w'zayt.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:03):**  Of course they are small scale farmers, they don't have that much land they own but they  produce enough quantities to be marketed through our organization or through our channel or  even through other traders, maybe locally.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:23):**  When we started in 2005, of course, mainly all the farmers joined the system because  they are thirsty for sustainable marketing for their production.  Now they are with us not just because the marketing but also they now believe that they  
**[0:28:41-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:28:41):**  are producing healthy food and they are contributing, which is very important for us as Palestinians  under occupation, we are contributing with other countries in order to save our planet,  in order to make a better, healthy life.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:04):**  Of course we are a very small country and maybe our contribution is very small, but  even so it's very important that we have a contribution.  We are part of this.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:17):**  Our farmers, they are, let's say, organic by default.  30 or 40 years ago there was no chemicals.  Maybe the intensive farming start maybe 40 or 45 years ago.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:28):**  So there was no intensive farming, there was no conventional farming, mainly the farmers  are organic.  Traditionally our farmers use the animal manure as an organic fertilizer which came from extensive  
**[0:29:42-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:42):**  farms, not intensive farms, from their own animals.  Also they can, let's say, do weeding by hand so they don't need to spray pesticides, herbicides,  sorry.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:29:56):**  And sometimes they plant some trees or some crops which can affect, let's say, keep the  insects or the pests away from your major crop.  For example, sometimes they plant garlic or onion or sometimes basil between the vegetables  
**[0:30:17-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:17):**  and this gives a good result in order to keep the insects away from your vegetables or from  your field.  We start talking with them about something new and not new.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:31):**  It's something new as a name, but it's not new as practices.  Some farmers they believe as much as you blow your land, as much you will get production.  Of course it's something, it's wrong.  
**[0:30:48-0:31:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:30:48):**  So other farmers they believe that they need to do just one blowing time which is on the  spring.  So it's accepted on the regenerative farming limit tillage or limit blowing.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:04):**  So maybe we start with 30 or 35 farmers.  They establish a connection between them to share experience and also to share other things  such as the machinery or the machines, some seeds, some land-based seeds which is very  
**[0:31:24-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:24):**  important in the regenerative farming.  They establish a kind of seed span or library for the seeds.  The farmers they produce their own organic land-based seeds which is of course pure seeds,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:43):**  not genetically modified, not treated.  The farmer for example, one farmer produce clover.  So next year part of the store, the quantity from last year from the clover seeds will  
**[0:31:58-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:31:58):**  be distributed to other farmers.  The other farmers for example have their own beans or legumes, let's say beans or fava beans.  So he will share the quantity with other farmers and so on.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:12):**  The alternatives for us it's very limited because in Palestine we don't have access  for our groundwater, for the ground aquifers because it's controlled by the Israelis.  So even if we try to find alternative, it's limited.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:32):**  So we are not able to dig wells for example to irrigate our crops.  Even if some of the farmers dig a well which is considered for the Israelis as illegal  well, if they discover they will directly come and destroy the well and he will be.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:32:52):**  So we start doing cover cropping.  Cover cropping, let's say has two functions.  The first one it's a cover.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:04):**  So it's a green cover for the soil.  This will reduce the evaporation or the loss of the moisture during summer.  And in the other hand it's doing a kind of do harvest.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:15):**  So in the early morning every day we have to do and of course due to the condensation  so we have water.  So due to the ground gravity or the earth gravity this will go directly to the upper  
**[0:33:31-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:31):**  part of the soil and this will make a kind of daily irrigation for the cover crop.  And also on the other hand the cover crop will reduce the evaporation or reduce the  effect of the sunlight during summer on the soil.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:47):**  We are sharing, all of us sharing this world.  We are all of us sharing this planet.  And we need to work all of us together.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:33:55):**  It's not enough for, I'm talking about farming even, it's not enough to work environmentally  friendly in order to have a better environment or more healthy environment.  We need to work all of us together.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:16):**  You as a customer in United Kingdom for example or any place in the world, when you choose  this product which was produced under organic or native farming this will help the farmers  or the producers to continue to be more resilient for what's happening, for the climate change,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade#t=0:34:37):**  for all these challenges which is very important.  So I think we need all of us to work together at all levels in order to help to protect  our planet, our environment because we don't know what's coming in the future.

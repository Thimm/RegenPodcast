**[0:00:22-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:00:22):**  annual Oxford Real Farming Conference, the ORFC. We embrace agriculture with new poetry  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:00:31):**  written at the front lines of farming. There's a brief introduction to human ecology and  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:00:36):**  some exciting innovations in urban food systems from a group in Glasgow. Out in the field

**[0:00:47-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:00:47):**  case for letting livestock browse on their favourite fodder.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:08):**  The conference always brings together a great mix of people, young and old, urban and rural,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:15):**  from near and far, all connected in their commitment to an agroecological future. This  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:21):**  year was a bit different, as politics took centre stage with a whole series of talks  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:26):**  discussing how Brexit will affect the food and farming industry. And, of course, a visit  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:32):**  from Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Here's  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:37):**  a little snippet as Zach Goldsmith kicked off the conversation with him.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:42):**  So my first question to you is, can you outline for us the vision that will underpin your  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:47):**  decisions as you rewrite the rules around CAP?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:51):**  First of all, thank you very much for inviting me here. And as Zach indicated, the venerable  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:01:56):**  conference down the road is more than 80 years old and you're just nine years old. To have  
**[0:02:03-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:03):**  a nine-year-old that is bigger than an 80-year-old is quite something. The challenge of leading  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:14):**  a department like Defra at this time is, as Zach says, huge. And the opportunities are  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:18):**  significant, the challenges are quite big as well. We have a bunch of money, we've got  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:22):**  £3 billion at the moment that we currently use to support agriculture. And I think that  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:28):**  that money is poorly spent. In essence, we give, as everyone here knows, broadly 80%  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:34):**  of that money through the BPS scheme to people purely on the basis of the size of the productive  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:39):**  agricultural landholder. And that means that public money often goes to those who have  
**[0:02:44-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:44):**  the largest and deepest pockets in – and the largest and – thank you. Yes, thank  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:02:54):**  you. Worse than that, the amount and the way in which the BPS system operates rewards inefficiency  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:01):**  and unsustainable agriculture. In essence, it says the most important thing to do is  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:06):**  just to drive yield come what may. And it also means that any part of your farm or your  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:14):**  landholding which is not turned over to productive agriculture doesn't really count in terms  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:21):**  of the amount of money you get. There are permanently ineligible features and those  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:25):**  permanently ineligible features are what most of us would call the countryside, beauty,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:31):**  nature but they're not rewarded in the system of subsidy that we have at the moment. And  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:37):**  I think that needs to change. I think that what we should be doing is using that public  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:43):**  money in order to achieve public goods. The heart of farming is always going to be food  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:48):**  production. I know we'll see more about some of what's wrong with how we produce  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:52):**  food at the moment. But ultimately, public money should go towards people who are thinking  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:03:57):**  hard and working hard in order to ensure that our environment is enhanced. So public money  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:02):**  should reward people who look after their soil rather than those who concentrate on  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:08):**  trying in any given year to maximize yield knowing that over time the health and fertility

**[0:04:19-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:19):**  a way which is respectful of the fact that unless we put back in to the soil, to nature,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:27):**  to our planet the care and cultivation and responsibility that has been missing in recent  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:34):**  years, what we risk doing is finding that our current method of subsidy isn't just

**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:44):**  driving soil erosion, the depletion of natural resource, the destruction of habitats on which

**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:54):**  which we can do that is by using the lever of financial support in a much more thoughtful  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:58):**  way.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:04:59):**  Thank you very much indeed.

**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:05:22):**  a definite air of caution. The proof will be in the pudding.

**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:10:53):**  at the people that you're working with, the environment that they live in, why they live

**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:11:43):**  holistically. So it's got the 12 principles of permaculture, which kind of combine quite  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:11:49):**  well with human ecology as a kind of practical way to implement the academic thinking behind  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:11:56):**  human ecology, to kind of implement that through a permaculture perspective. Back in 2008,

**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:12:13):**  design courses, normal people living in high-rise flats in Glasgow, and it was differently delivered

**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:13:40):**  a part of the rotation to come round on the farm so that I could establish some sanfoin.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:13:45):**  Having read quite a lot about it, I discovered that sanfoin actually covered 25% of the Cotswolds  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:13:51):**  a hundred years ago. And it was because it took 25% of your land mass to grow the energy  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:13:56):**  to feed the horses to work your farm. So I didn't need any proof that the Cotswolds was  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:01):**  a great place to grow sanfoin. And I wanted to do it because it has all of these lovely  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:06):**  properties. It's a natural anthelmendic for organic systems. It's legamous, it fixes a  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:11):**  huge amount of natural nitrogen into the system. And it's a bulky crop. So traditionally we  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:19):**  would grow red clover and rye grass and then sile it for feeding dairy cows and various  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:23):**  ruminant stomachs on the farm. But sanfoin had the ability to give us a greater bulk  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:29):**  and be drought resistant because it's very deep tap rooted. So having read a little bit  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:35):**  further I then was extremely excited to read that actually sanfoin was grown for the first  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:40):**  time ever in this country at Dalsford in 1752. So you can imagine that was quite exciting  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:46):**  that the first seeds were brought back to Dalsford. The original seat of Dalsford House  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:52):**  had been a guy called John Hastings who was the first Governor General of India I believe.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:14:58):**  And it was his son that travelled the world and brought back sanfoin seeds to Dalsford.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:04):**  So that was really exciting. And then over the last few years we now started off with  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:08):**  a small piece as an experiment and now we would have several hundred acres of sanfoin  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:14):**  here at Dalsford. And it is fantastic and it's here to stay. So not only was I interested  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:21):**  in the bulk of the crop which came to fruition and it'll yield about 50% more than rye grass  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:27):**  and red clover, it's also very nutrient rich. So there are proteins within sanfoin that'll  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:34):**  break down within the ruminant stomach far better than any other sort of forage. So if  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:39):**  I talk about disadvantages, yes the seed is quite expensive but it can be harvested and  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:43):**  saved. It's a long term lay so looked after it can last for up to eight years. It's what  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:50):**  I call a crown grown plant so it comes out of the ground and then sort of tillers into  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:15:55):**  a crown. If you chew that crown out you've lost the plant so you have to be careful when

**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:16:31):**  Sanfoin honey is well sought after and the bees love it. So why wouldn't you grow sanfoin  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-30-gove-agri-culture-human-ecology-sanfoin-and-pollarding#t=0:16:37):**  in a sustainable, environmentally friendly farming system. So it's a winner winner completely

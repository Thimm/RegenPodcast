**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:00):**  Spoils, written at Romshed Farm in Kent in February.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:08):**  Cattle come running to the hum of the quad bike, the promise of hay sweeter than this  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:12):**  tired winter grass.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:16):**  Here at the top of the field in the cold rise above the farm, where the wind sits heavy  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:20):**  on the sun's shine, grass grips close to soil.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:27):**  Brambles flail over the fence lip, combs of bracken are pressed into oblivion by eager  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:33):**  hooves.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:35):**  We have lured the bullocks here, away from the softer curves of the farm's lower reaches.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:41):**  The hay hurled from the trailer is a bribe for their trampling, a tribute, no weed killer  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:47):**  here.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:49):**  The land manages itself under the pressure of hooves, despite the old spaniel with a  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:00:54):**  mucky eye, keen to guard the bracken, barking and fainting rash challenges to the cows as  
**[0:01:00-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:01:00):**  they rip hay apart with limber tongues, test their nascent horns brother on brother in  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:01:08):**  glass-eyed hunger games.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:01:12):**  Today they are grass-starved demigods, these bullocks, manoeuvred and conditioned by greed  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:01:19):**  into keeping down stray weeds.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/spoils#t=0:01:23):**  All that spoils the pasture, corrupts the soil.

## ‘Cereal’ Episode 6: Grain futures  
**[0:00:00-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Cereal from Farmerama. This is episode 6, Grain Futures.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:23):**  That's the Lost Travelers, playing at the Harvest Party we recently hosted at E5 Bakehouse  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:28):**  in London. And against that lovely backdrop, we've reached the end of our cereal journey.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:34):**  An end which is in fact, just the beginning.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:40):**  In this episode, we'll be revisiting some of the people we've met over the course of the series.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:46):**  They'll be sharing their visions for the future of grain. What needs to happen to build resilient  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:52):**  local grain economies? And what is already happening? First though, I want to pick out  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:00:58):**  some of the common threads I've noticed in the conversations I've had while making this series.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:04):**  I think it's fair to say there's a general feeling that the industrial bread system is  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:08):**  underpinned by a flawed logic. A logic that's damaging to people and planet.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:15):**  As we've heard, it's a logic of alienation. It relies on creating barriers between people  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:21):**  in the system, and between people and food. It's a logic of uniformity. It can't cope with diversity,  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:28):**  let alone strive to promote it. It's a logic that implicitly assumes that automation is  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:33):**  synonymous with progress, and that bigger necessarily equals better. At every stage,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:40):**  from soil to seed to flower to loaf, this logic is undermining the natural systems we depend on.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:47):**  Our health, both physical and mental, the fabric of our communities, and the value of people's work.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:01:55):**  But just as these crises are interconnected, so are the solutions to them.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:00):**  Here's Andrew Whitley from Scotland the Bread.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:03):**  Now, when you factor in the other sort of elephant in the room, which is climate change,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:08):**  climate crisis, and the impact, the carbon emitting impact of extended supply chains with  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:15):**  big industrial processes, which are very energy intensive, then you begin to see that there is  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:22):**  another route. There is another way out of this, which in fact involves, in the language of the  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:28):**  Real Bread campaign, more jobs per loaf, rather than the other way around. And that's an inversion  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:33):**  of the conventional thinking of capitalist efficiency.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:37):**  In this series, we've heard about a new grains movement that's based on this inversion of  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:43):**  conventional thinking. A movement with a different logic and a different set of aspirations.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:50):**  It aspires to diversity instead of uniformity, from the life in the soil to the life in our guts,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:02:56):**  from the genetics of our seeds to the backgrounds of the people baking our bread.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:01):**  Resilience as opposed to infinite expansion. Collaboration rather than competition.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:07):**  Working on a human scale, not an industrial scale. And at every stage, getting people back into the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:14):**  system, into the mills, onto the farms, into the bakeries and around the tables, encouraging  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:21):**  bakers and farmers and millers and breeders and consumers to talk to each other.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:27):**  It's a sharing exercise and it's accepting that you have a lot to gain from being part of that  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:34):**  feedback loop, from being part of that community, and that you also have a lot to offer.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:39):**  Kimberly Bell from Small Food Bakery in Nottingham.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:42):**  A problem that they have could potentially be resolved by a solution that you hold,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:48):**  and vice versa. And I think when marketplaces become depersonalised, when people become very  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:03:55):**  detached, those conversations don't happen. And so we end up with systems that are compensating  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:03):**  for problems that could have been very easily resolved. And the reason why this is important  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:07):**  is simply because I think to create a better food system we have to reconnect with nature  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:13):**  and we have to reconnect with natural values. We can't continue to extract more resources  
**[0:04:19-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:19):**  than are available. We are all needing to eat from the same field, in fact. So we might as  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:27):**  well work together to try and get the best out of that field.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:30):**  Kim is not talking about regressing to some quaint, harmonious vision of the past.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:35):**  This is about creating a more efficient bread system. A system that generates a lot less waste,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:42):**  and takes responsibility for any waste it does create. A system that operates as more of a closed  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:47):**  loop than a linear production line. A system that accounts for all of its impacts, including  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:53):**  everything from people's wages and their job satisfaction, to the carbon footprint of distribution  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:04:58):**  networks, to the health of our soils and the health of our bodies. And building this better,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:04):**  more efficient system first requires a shift in mindset.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:08):**  We all talk about the food system and I think it's really hard actually. We have perhaps  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:15):**  an inadequate language to be able to describe it, but we talk about it as if it's other,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:20):**  or as if it's something that's out there. And just by doing that we're actually taking  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:25):**  ourselves out of it. I think you can apply the same thing to the way that we're fumbling  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:30):**  around trying to understand our position in nature right now with climate change.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:34):**  I can't help but feel like these discussions are often flawed because we always remove  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:40):**  ourselves from the system before we start to imagine it or reimagine it. And I think we've  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:45):**  done that with food. We've completely removed ourselves from the system and then the system  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:50):**  starts to dictate how we interact with it rather than the other way around. I think  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:56):**  that's quite dangerous.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:05:58):**  We are the bread system. Even those of us who interact with it primarily as consumers.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:04):**  If you eat bread, you're part of it. But the current system tells us otherwise. It encourages  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:10):**  us to be passive consumers and it encourages farmers and millers and bakers to be passive  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:16):**  producers. So creating a better system is about moving from passivity to agency. In  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:23):**  other words, it's about reclaiming food sovereignty.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:26):**  Again, it does just fundamentally come back to removing the barriers and our own belief  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:31):**  systems are one of the barriers that we need to break down. And so if we can just move  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:35):**  towards a belief we are part of the food system, then that immediately offers loads of exciting  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:41):**  possibilities because I think everyone's voice should be in the mix. If we can just  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:45):**  take a kind of evolutionary metaphor for how we need to survive the coming years of climate  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:06:54):**  challenge and biodiversity loss, we need to behave like a kind of evolutionary species.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:00):**  And I think removing as many barriers to that as possible can only be helpful. I think empowerment  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:06):**  of everybody to enjoy their food culture and to take part in it is probably one of the  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:12):**  most important steps or a first step before we even bother about all of the detail.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:18):**  So how can we start to understand ourselves as part of the system?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:23):**  I don't think it's right to say that our food system is broken.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:27):**  Stephen Jacobs from Organic Farmers and Growers.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:30):**  I don't think ordinary people understand when you say that. Hang on, I've got food  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:37):**  on the shelf, I'm not starving. I think it's more useful to say the food system is dislocated  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:45):**  and what we need to do is to put the socket back in the joint. The idea is that in order  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:52):**  to effect that positive change both culturally and agriculturally, you need to understand  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:07:57):**  the economics as well as the ecology. Grassroots is going to be the one that will influence  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:03):**  the policy makers. So in order to effect positive change we need to get a miller and a baker  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:11):**  talk to the farmer and they're doing that while still running their usual business.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:17):**  We're not talking about some weird massive handbrake, we're talking about a slow but  
**[0:08:25-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:25):**  steady and transformative process. And that you must involve people. The people who come  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:35):**  to the bakeries, who go to the restaurants where the chefs are who are switched on to  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:39):**  this have to not just be served a plate of food, they have to be given the information  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:45):**  and they have to get excited about it.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:48):**  We want to have a story with our food, it just makes it all the more interesting.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:52):**  Ben McKinnon, founder of E5 Bakehouse in London.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:08:56):**  It's not a sort of romance, it has real impacts because we're creating more jobs, we're  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:02):**  training more people and we're creating more micro economies and micro supply chains that  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:07):**  I think will let us all feel more connected to the land and make us look after it better  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:12):**  ultimately.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:17):**  One of the most challenging and compelling things about making this series is that everything  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:22):**  is so interconnected.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:26):**  Pick at any thread, soil health, food poverty, climate change, job satisfaction, wheat intolerance,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:33):**  genetic diversity and you realise it's entangled conceptually and practically with every other  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:39):**  thread. That entanglement is the whole point and it's one of the things that makes this  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:46):**  New Grains movement so exciting. It means that an apparently localised event, a conversation,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:52):**  a connection, a purchase, a gathering, a shift in thinking, all of them can spark much wider  
**[0:09:58-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:09:58):**  change. So let's hear about some of the organisations and individuals creating those sparks.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:09):**  Anne Parry is the miller at Vellin Ganol Watermill in West Wales. Together with her husband Andy,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:15):**  she produces a range of stone ground flowers. By collaborating with farmers and demonstrating  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:21):**  that there is demand for locally grown milling wheat, Vellin Ganol is playing an important  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:26):**  role in reviving the area's grain economy. Anne's experience of setting up the mill led  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:32):**  her to establish the Welsh Grain Forum.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:35):**  All these conversations we've been having, it was obvious to me that we weren't alone  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:39):**  and I was really quite inspired by the things that were going on in the States with main  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:43):**  grains and the people who were working over in Washington state and reinvigorating their  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:50):**  grain economies really. And I thought, you know, we could do this in Wales. We've got  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:53):**  a lot of farmers who are keen to turn to regenerative agriculture and actually improve their income  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:10:59):**  streams by growing crops on a mixed farm and actually being able to do this kind of thing  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:03):**  again. We've got the universities with their research departments. There's a lot going  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:08):**  on really. We could actually market a local grain. And people were doing it in little  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:13):**  patches here and there. There's ourselves, there are another couple of mills. There were  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:17):**  farmers who were sort of trying, looking at on-farm mills or setting up peasant bakeries.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:22):**  And I felt we should all be talking together really, because otherwise we're all in danger  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:25):**  of reinventing the wheel. And all the infrastructure was gone. We were all very tiny and we needed  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:31):**  to get together to work that out. What it basically is, is a networking group really,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:36):**  so that people are actually talking to each other and hopefully, slowly but surely, we're  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:41):**  actually getting things off the ground.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:43):**  Yes, so Welsh Grain Forum is a collaboration between millers, bakers, farmers, brewers,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:51):**  molesters and anyone else involved in the grain economy in Wales.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:11:57):**  That's Rupert Dunn from Torthetir Peasant Bakery in South Wales.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:01):**  And it's trying to put all those actors back in touch with each other to reinvigorate the  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:06):**  grain economy. So farmers know how to talk to millers, millers know how to talk to bakers  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:12):**  and molsters. And on a basic level, it's meetings of people coming together to share ideas and  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:17):**  discuss what's happening. And it's a great little forum when you come together and meet  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:22):**  those people and gain support. Because if you're trying to do something different, I  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:25):**  think in Wales, sometimes you're on a farm down a lane, down a track somewhere, and you  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:29):**  want to grow some heritage wheat and well, hey, you want to talk to people about it.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:33):**  You want to compare notes or gain inspiration. It's really important that we come together  
**[0:12:37-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:37):**  to do those things. Yeah, so that's in a nutshell, I guess, what the Grain Forum does.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:48):**  Scotland the Bread is a social business working to grow better grain and bake better bread.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:54):**  Their many initiatives include reviving heritage wheat varieties and testing them in different  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:12:59):**  Scottish microclimates, engaging communities with cereal production through their Soil  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:03):**  to Slice citizen science project, supporting the establishment of community bakeries, and  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:09):**  milling organic heritage flour at the Balkasky Estate in Fife. Here's Andrew Whitley to explain  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:16):**  why Scotland the Bread are starting at the start with the soil and the seed. Sorry, by  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:22):**  the way, for the sawmill noise in the background of this clip. It's one of the many hazards  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:27):**  of recording on a farm. Scotland the Bread is an attempt to improve  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:32):**  grain and bread in Scotland, which has a particular problem in this regard because it's a country  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:38):**  which grows a million tons of very good wheat, which would be about five or six times as  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:44):**  much as it would need to feed the entire country with bread and bread products. But it doesn't  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:50):**  use any of that grain for that purpose or derisory quantities. So where does it go?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:13:55):**  What's it used for? Well, increasingly, unfortunately, the production of ethanol for biodiesel for  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:00):**  cars, feeding cars, not people, and even worse than that, arguably cheap alcohol, which not  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:07):**  only doesn't make a contribution to dealing with Scotland's serious problems of diet related  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:11):**  ill health, but actually appears as a serious social problem in terms of replacing food  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:16):**  to some extent and causing severe problems of alcoholism in certain communities, or facilitating  
**[0:14:22-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:22):**  it, shall we say. Now, some action is being taken on minimum alcohol pricing and sugar  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:30):**  taxes and that kind of thing. But nobody's really addressing this by joining up certain  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:35):**  obvious dots, which are if you could get better grains grown more locally, with a lower degree  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:42):**  of intensity in terms of agricultural inputs and all their polluting and carbon emitting  
**[0:14:48-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:48):**  consequences, then you might make a contribution simultaneously to biodiversity or landscape  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:14:57):**  health, to human health by making better bread and getting it closer to the end user, all  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:04):**  in one fell swoop. And that's what we're trying to do. So we've started on the ground saying,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:09):**  which varieties of grain, not just sort of super hybrid modern varieties that somebody's  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:14):**  bred which will break down in terms of their disease resistance in three or four years  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:19):**  or five years, whatever, but actually, are there grains which perhaps used to grow in  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:25):**  Scotland or in similar climates, which are inherently more diverse in terms of their  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:31):**  genetics and might therefore be more resilient to be grown without the use of chemical inputs  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:37):**  and plant protection products, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides and so on, and could  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:43):**  be made into bread, which was more digestible and more nutritious. So the proposition is  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:48):**  less impact on the ground, the landscape on the farming system on soils, and a requirement  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:15:55):**  for fewer slices for satisfaction, which deals with the extra potential cost it will grow  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:02):**  if we get off the treadmill of this essential commodity market situation.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:09):**  As well as networks like the Welsh Grain Forum and organizations like Scotland the Bread,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:15):**  companies also have an important role to play in getting us off that commodity treadmill  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:19):**  and helping farmers to become food producers. Hodma Dodds is one company working to do just  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:26):**  that. Hodma Dodds was founded off the back of the Great British Beans Trial, which aimed  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:31):**  to assess and stimulate demand for British grown pulses. The trial was a great success,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:37):**  and Hodma Dodds now works with farmers to source British grown pulses, seeds and grains. They're  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:43):**  challenging assumptions about what it's possible and economical to grow in the UK. So what's  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:49):**  the Hodma Dodds vision? Here's Josiah Meldrum, one of the co-founders.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:16:54):**  So we are really keen to facilitate, enable, allow to happen a kind of broader transition  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:01):**  to agroecological food systems. So a move away from monocultural commodity production  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:07):**  towards more localized, diverse food economies that are dependent on a much wider range of  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:13):**  crops that are in themselves making a positive contribution to the ecology of the farm systems  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:18):**  within which they're grown. That's kind of the bigger picture. And that that should be  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:22):**  equitable and fair and equal and healthy and all of those things that I think we'd all  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:26):**  strive for but that are not being delivered by the current food system.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:30):**  So how can a company like Hodma Dodds help to make that vision a reality?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:35):**  For a farmer that's producing grain on a large scale and in East Anglia where we're based  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:40):**  that might be a thousand or a two thousand acre farm which has cereals in a probably  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:45):**  quite straightforward rotation often just wheat, wheat, wheat, rape, maybe wheat, wheat,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:51):**  wheat. It's very, very difficult to break out of that. They are capitalized in terms  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:17:55):**  of their farm business and their machinery to produce wheat in a very particular way with  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:00):**  a very particular set of costs that allow them to sell into the commodity market either  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:03):**  for milling or more likely probably into the feed wheat market. For them to break out of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:09):**  that and to grow a more unusual cereal is a huge risk and a real challenge. For a start  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:15):**  they haven't got the machinery to handle those small quantities and then they also need to  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:20):**  find a market that will reflect the extra effort and risk that they've taken in growing  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:24):**  those crops. We see our role as an enabler, as a facilitator. We can work with a farmer  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:30):**  and help them to find a way to grow the crops on a smaller scale and also to find them a  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:36):**  market for those crops. In terms of the help that we might be able to offer the farmer  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:41):**  in growing it we can offer some very basic agronomy based on our experience and skills  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:45):**  with those crops. We can offer them help with finding seed and looking for varieties that  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:51):**  have the kind of traits that bakers and millers and home cooks are looking for whether that's  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:18:55):**  flavour or protein content or milling qualities. And so we can work in partnership with the  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:01):**  farmer to allow them to grow crops on a smaller scale that they know have an end market that  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:07):**  reflects the effort and the risk they've taken in growing them. And that sounds kind of fairly  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:10):**  obvious but it's actually extraordinarily difficult to make all those pieces come together  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:14):**  and happen. And what does it look like when it does happen? Here's Shropshire based organic  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:20):**  farmer Mark Lee. He came across Hodmer Dodds about six years ago. We were growing peas  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:25):**  at the time for feed and anything you grow for feed is a sort of commodity because no  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:32):**  human being is specifically interested in it. It's about what its protein level is and  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:36):**  what it costs. And we were growing peas for animal feed. Peas are really really hard to  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:40):**  grow and organically more so. And the value of those peas was in my view not fair and  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:48):**  it was set by imported prices because the feed industry works on a, certainly on a European  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:53):**  level if not a global level as far as pricing is concerned. So our peas were valued at the  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:19:57):**  cost of peas off a boat in Southampton. In desperation trawling through Sumer and other  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:03):**  whole food catalogues and outlets to see what we could grow. Could we grow chickpeas, could  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:07):**  we grow lentils for human consumption, could we find something. And then I found the very  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:13):**  young and shiny Hodmer Dodds were just starting out. They came over and we got on really well  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:18):**  and we've grown peas for them ever since. So that took us to a position where our crops  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:23):**  were then in packets, on shelves, being bought by real life customers that we didn't know.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:31):**  Social media of course getting going and those people were then tweeting about that saying  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:35):**  that they'd bought these peas and they really liked them. So I was able to interact with  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:39):**  those people which is just wonderful as a grower of something to be thanked not only  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:45):**  by the person that you've just sold 10 tonnes of it to but the person who's just bought  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:49):**  300 grams of it was a really nice feeling. So it all builds this feeling of appreciation  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:54):**  which then gives you the motivation to keep going. So getting closer to our market through  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:20:58):**  them has encouraged us again to look again at wheat and see whether we can do something  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:04):**  similar in the sense of style at least some of our wheat much more directly and shorten  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:09):**  the supply chain with the wheat and get the direct appreciation hopefully of customers  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:15):**  rather than indirect as we are at the moment.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:21):**  One of the things all these initiatives are doing is building connections. As we've heard  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:26):**  throughout the series bringing people together and especially people who usually work in  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:30):**  isolation from each other that can be a hugely powerful force for change. It was with that  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:36):**  in mind that Kimberly Bell, founder of Small Food Bakery in Nottingham, organised the first  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:41):**  Grain Lab, a gathering of farmers, millers, plant breeders, bakers, cooks, scientists  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:47):**  and academics. She was inspired to do so after attending Grain Gathering, an event organised  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:54):**  by the Bread Lab at Washington State University. Bread Lab is a project that breeds publicly  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:21:59):**  available grain varieties with the goal of improving people's access to affordable,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:04):**  nutritious food. And I realised when I went to that conference  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:08):**  for the first time how powerful it was when you bring people together who are passionate  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:12):**  and who all want to pull in the same direction. Just having this sort of combination of an  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:17):**  intense learning experience with a very convivial social atmosphere and eating loads of great  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:24):**  food. I know there was something so deeply moving about the whole experience and it really  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:30):**  set my intentions going forward. One of the keynote speakers there was Dawn Woodward.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:35):**  Dawn Woodward is the co-founder of Evelyn's Crackers, a Toronto-based food company working  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:41):**  to bring heritage grains to the public. And she spoke about sustainability, which  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:47):**  was a really broad topic that really spoke to me because I was thinking about how I wanted  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:52):**  to develop my business and the direction I wanted to go and what I was really trying  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:22:57):**  to do, like what was it all for. And I just always remember her saying, I think towards  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:02):**  the end of her speech, that we have to be more than just bakers. And it just stayed  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:07):**  with me the whole time and I just thought, you know, what does that mean? Like, how can  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:11):**  we be more than just bakers? One of the ways in which I wanted to contribute  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:18):**  was very much to bring that very emotional experience back to the UK. I thought we don't  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:23):**  have a gathering like that in the UK. And then also I'd met Martin and I'd learned  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:27):**  about the population wheat and people were starting to ring me and email me about what  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:33):**  we were doing and they'd come across the flour being grown somewhere else and they wanted  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:37):**  to use it in their bakeries and could we share formulas.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:40):**  Kim's talking about the YQ population, a genetically diverse population of wheat developed by Professor  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:46):**  Martin Wolf. Having met Martin and learned about the benefits of population wheat, Kim  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:52):**  was inspired to become a self-described ambassador for YQ.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:23:55):**  So it's a combination of the aspiration of wanting to replicate a fabulous experience  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:01):**  like grain gathering and also wanting to bring a group of people together around the population  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:08):**  wheat to understand and to learn a bit from Martin as I'd had the privilege to do. So  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:14):**  the first meeting was in 2017 and it was just 50 people who I invited and they were mainly  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:21):**  just people who had some kind of connection to Martin or connection to the population  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:25):**  wheat and they just wanted us to have a day workshopping out ideas and learning from each  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:28):**  other and talking about localised grain economies because that's really what the population  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:34):**  was for. It was a way of empowering people to take back control over their bread, their  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:40):**  flour, their grain, their seed. It was about sovereignty. And then everybody had such a  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:45):**  nice time, everyone was like, oh we're going to do that again. So that gave me permission  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:49):**  really to make it into a much bigger event in 2018 and then we ticketed it, we invited  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:54):**  people from around the world to come speak about their own experiences in forming alternative  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:24:59):**  grain economies. And I was very pleased to observe that most of the people who came had  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:04):**  a very similar experience as to what I'd had when I'd gone to America which was like deeply  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:09):**  inspiring and it really set my intentions. And now we are, I don't know, 10 months on  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:15):**  from the big event in 2018 and I'm already seeing all this kind of energy that was sparked  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:22):**  by the event and the connections that were made and people coming together in small communities  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:26):**  in the regions and building their grain economies. It's really fabulous. I just think intention  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:32):**  is such a powerful thing, just getting people to emotionally invest in a profession or a  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:38):**  craft or just a particular direction that they want to go in and then getting them to  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:42):**  come together and do it together. It's just, I don't know, it's amazing how quickly we  
**[0:25:48-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:48):**  can make change and how much we can achieve in the timeframe. I've been amazed, actually.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:25:59):**  Having itself been inspired by gatherings in the USA, GrainLab has already been the  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:03):**  catalyst for other events such as Common Grains which brought together Scotland-based bakers,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:09):**  growers, millers and activists in Fife in autumn 2019. And back in May 2019, I was lucky  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:16):**  enough to be part of Bread as a Commons. It was a chance to think about the future of  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:21):**  grain through the lens of the commons and the act of commoning. The event was instigated  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:26):**  by Tommaso Ferrando, a lawyer and academic and an expert in food as a commons-based as  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:32):**  opposed to a commodity-based system. And he really enjoyed being at GrainLab and he was  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:38):**  very moved by everyone's enthusiasm and energy levels and then pledged to put on a further  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:43):**  event that would serve a community specifically in the South West. And it just so happened  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:49):**  that looking at the delegate list from the GrainLab, there was a lot of people from the  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:54):**  South West who were very engaged in these issues. We were able to convene at Fred Price's  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:26:59):**  farm in Somerset, a group of 30 people who came together for a weekend just to talk about  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:05):**  what a commons-based grain system might look like, might feel like, how we might create  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:09):**  it. Tommaso guided our discussions with another academic, José Luis Fivero-Pol. They advocate  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:17):**  for an understanding of the commons that includes both material and immaterial resources as  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:22):**  well as practices. Material resources could be things like grain and immaterial resources  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:28):**  are things like recipes. Practices include the collective management of those resources  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:33):**  with the goal of ensuring that everyone has access to food. The practices are the doing  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:38):**  part, the commoning, and it's through commoning, through the practice of collective management  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:43):**  for the collective good, that resources become part of the commons. Here's Tommaso to explain  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:50):**  more. So food as commons is the recognition of the essential nature of food for the human  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:27:56):**  beings but also the inherent and intrinsic connection with planet and the ecological  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:03):**  balance of the planet. And so it means thinking about a food system that is capable of providing  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:07):**  for people and the planet and actually not only providing but also giving more than what  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:12):**  it is extracting. So it's a food that is socially and environmentally just and affordable and  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:18):**  is a system that recognises that sharing and cooperating are central and that competing  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:27):**  and extracting are detrimental. So it's a different way of looking at food not as an  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:33):**  item as an object of consumption but as a set of social and environmental relationship  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:37):**  and really like starting from that in order to think about what we have been doing wrong  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:41):**  in the last, well, hundreds of years if you take into consideration the extractivism of  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:48):**  the international food system but in particular in the last 40-50 years with the industrialised  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:52):**  and highly processed food system. The idea of the commons is fascinating and  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:28:57):**  complicated and contested. I think it could be a hugely powerful challenge to the assumptions  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:03):**  that underpin our current commodity-based food system. As well as provoking a lot of  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:08):**  thought and a lot of debate, the Bread as a Commons event had at least one very concrete  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:13):**  outcome. Somerset-based farmer Fred Price hosted the event.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:18):**  I left with a very clear idea that there were people in the room that wanted to bake with  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:24):**  grain that had a provenance and had someone behind it and that I needed people to bake  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:31):**  with my grain to put a face to it rather than put it on a lorry. And so since all those  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:37):**  people were in the room it seemed very sensible just to join up and get the ball rolling.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:42):**  And I'm really excited to hear back from the people who have now formed essentially a south-west  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:48):**  grains group and they're working towards localising their grain economy around Fred Price's farm  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:53):**  and his crops and I feel like they're going to be an inspiration to all of us really because  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:29:59):**  they're working together so successfully. This collective of bakers and millers have  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:03):**  come together with the farmer, Fred, as the South West Grain Network.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:08):**  The network for me means I can put a face to grain. To me, grain was something you put  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:14):**  on the lorry, grain was a commodity. I have no control over the price of that commodity,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:18):**  it's set on a global market. And that means that we have to work back from that point,  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:25):**  which inevitably means as a farmer you have to grow for yield because that's the only  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:29):**  intervention you can make that affects profitability. So with the network, now we put a face to  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:36):**  the product and we can start by saying, how do I as a farmer want to grow this product?  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:42):**  How do you as a baker want to use it? And then you work backwards from there and you  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:47):**  find out what price you need to set that works for both of you. And that's quite a different  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:51):**  approach. And I think that it's best summed up in a phrase of saying like, I'm now a food  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:30:57):**  producer, not a commodity producer. It's a great demonstration of the power of  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:02):**  gatherings, of coming together, of relationships to facilitate change.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:07):**  I get the impression as well that because the bakers have now got stronger relationship  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:11):**  with Fred and they've been on the farm and spent time with these, having these discussions,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:15):**  that actually their intentions are set quite clearly to support the economy for that localised  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:21):**  grain. Maybe much more than they would have done if they hadn't spent that time together  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:26):**  in that kind of convivial atmosphere. And I think what it's about, GrainLab and the  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:31):**  Grain as a Commons meeting, is spending time understanding other people's perspectives.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:36):**  And really for a baker to understand the farming perspective, for a farmer to understand the  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:40):**  baker's perspective, there's so much misunderstanding that can form barriers to actually moving  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:44):**  forward. And I think that's been one of the most positive outcomes of these meetings.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:49):**  I think as long as we keep them convivial, joyful, with great food and lots of wine and  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:31:56):**  fun, then people will always turn up and they will always have their intentions reset as  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:00):**  a result of it. And it pulls people together in the same direction.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:06):**  So what does Fred, once a self-confessed yield chasing commodity farmer, what does he now  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:12):**  hope the future holds? Well, lots of South West grain networks.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:16):**  Immediately in the short term, I think we need more growers and more growers across  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:21):**  the UK to spread the risk. Because local grain is different from, I think, what I'm describing,  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:28):**  which is like human scale grain networks. Because we have to acknowledge that when you  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:34):**  localise things in terms of an immediate vicinity, you increase the risk. And grain is seasonal  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:40):**  and weather dependent. So if we could increase the scope of these networks right through  
**[0:32:44-0:32:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:44):**  the UK, each of them buffers the next one in terms of quality and consistency of flour.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:52):**  When I look forward, the solution is not get bigger ever, and it's not competitive. So  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:32:59):**  my vision is to make sure that there's always a human scale to everything, and to make sure  
**[0:33:06-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:06):**  that we're always collaborative. And it's to increase our impact in terms of the UK  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:14):**  grain network by increasing the scope of our network. So to encourage people to set up  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:21):**  similar things all across the country, and to be as supportive and sharing and open as  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:27):**  possible.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:34):**  In all of these examples, as well as the many we haven't mentioned, what they show is that  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:39):**  change is happening. And it's change based on the principles we heard about at the start  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:45):**  of the episode. Diversity, resilience, collaboration, working on a human scale, and bringing people  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:33:53):**  back into the system. There's one more principle that I think unites all of these stories.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:00):**  Joy. In a time of climate emergency, health crises, and increasing economic inequality,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:08):**  it might seem frivolous and self-indulgent to invoke a word like that. But I don't think  
**[0:34:13-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:13):**  it is. I think it's crucial. What I mean by joy could also be referred to as contentment,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:20):**  or purpose, or equality of life, or simply good mental health. In any case, in my experience,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:27):**  and based on the conversations I've had, I think joy can spring from precisely the  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:32):**  things the New Grains movement is promoting. Things like direct relationships, food that  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:38):**  tastes good and is genuinely nourishing, feeling a sense of belonging and a sense of agency,  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:45):**  satisfying, meaningful work.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:47):**  I think in our current culture, although this is changing, luckily, there's very much a  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:53):**  narrative of you go to work and you pay your dues. You do your time, and then the rest  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:34:59):**  of your free time is when you get to be you, or you get to enjoy yourself. I suppose it's  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:05):**  one of the most amazing transformations for me, is that I don't see any distinction, really,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:11):**  between my work and who I am. I get to do something that I enjoy in a very tangible  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:18):**  way, but it also makes me feel like I'm part of something, or I'm just being me within  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:25):**  a system. I suppose it's convenient for industry to promote the other system because it creates  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:32):**  economic units out of us. We are going to spend a lot of money on those weekends to  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:38):**  try and compensate for the things that we feel we're owed, or the things we should  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:43):**  be enjoying. It keeps the wheels turning, the economic wheels turning, and the more  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:49):**  you look into it, the more ridiculous the whole thing seems. It's all about creating  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:35:56):**  kind of marginal gains for someone else at the end of the day. I suppose that probably  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:01):**  sounds a bit high-falutin for a conversation about bread and bakeries, but it really is  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:09):**  political, I think, even if you don't want it to be.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:13):**  An industrial bread system, an industrial food system, can't give us what we need.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:20):**  It can't have the capacity to respect baking as a craft and bakers as craft's people.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:25):**  It can't allow dough the time it needs to ferment properly. It can't enable us to  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:30):**  buy our bread directly from the people who bake it. It can't help farmers to have meaningful  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:35):**  connections with the people who buy their grain or mill it, let alone with the people  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:40):**  who eventually eat it. All this talk of diversity, of meaningful connections, of working on a  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:47):**  human scale and respecting people's work, I know it might all seem a bit naive, a bit  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:52):**  utopian, but I think there's a compelling argument in its favour. In short, there is  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:36:58):**  no alternative. In the face of climate change, the industrial  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:02):**  bread system cannot remain resilient. Any system that relies on alienation, on creating  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:09):**  physical and emotional distance between the actors within it, on a logic of ever greater  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:14):**  uniformity, on the belief that infinite growth is both possible and desirable, in an age  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:20):**  of climate crisis, any system based on those principles is increasingly vulnerable.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:27):**  And to come back to Joy for a moment, I also think it's crucial to counter the narrative  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:32):**  that mitigating and adapting to climate change can only mean hardship, sacrifice, grinning  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:38):**  and bearing it. It doesn't have to be like that, and it shouldn't be like that. In making  
**[0:37:44-0:37:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:44):**  this series, I've encountered so much joy. It's energising. So maybe the new grains  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:51):**  movement can lead the way for a wider change in our food system, and in other systems as  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:37:57):**  well. Not just in the UK, but around the world.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:01):**  One of the biggest things that we need is sharing of information.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:05):**  It's farmer, miller and mill designer Fintan Keenan.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:08):**  And that's going to have to come from the bottom up, it's not going to come from the  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:10):**  top down. So we're going to have to have these grassroots structures in order to be able  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:15):**  to re-establish local grain economies, which is really exciting. And especially, I believe,  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:22):**  with the new generation of farmers. You see people like Fred Price, you see Oscar here  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:26):**  at Duchess Farms, you see farmer George, and when you speak to them, that enthusiasm is  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:30):**  just like boom! You know, it's incredible. And if we can get so many people like that  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:34):**  fired up, who are interested in it, that's going to be contagious. And that's what's  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:38):**  going to help grow these local economies. It's not just here, it's not just regional.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:42):**  We have an amazing opportunity in terms of a global collaboration. I think the sharing  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:46):**  of information is something that is happening from Australia, to the States, to Argentina,  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:51):**  to here in Europe, you know, and it's incredible. And I think with the drive and enthusiasm  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:38:57):**  of that, this will happen. You know, it's not a question of how can we make it happen,  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:02):**  it's already started. The wheels are in motion. But we need to gear up. It needs to happen  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:08):**  a little bit faster. Some people think, ah, you know, you just chill out a little bit.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:13):**  I don't think we have the time to chill out. I think we need to get this rolling now as  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:18):**  fast as possible.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:23):**  This series does not claim to be a comprehensive record of everything that's happening in the  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:27):**  grain world at the moment. It can't be. And the point is, that's exciting. I've been  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:33):**  struck by just how much is going on and how much energy there is. There's a real sense  
**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:39):**  of possibility in the air of momentum and shared purpose. There are a lot of reasons  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:46):**  to feel pessimistic at the moment. But in this new grains movement, I've found optimism,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:51):**  clear-sightedness and generosity. So if anything you've heard in this series catches your interest,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:39:59):**  I'd urge you to follow it up, to reach out, to get involved. It might be as simple as  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:40:05):**  asking a question about the next loaf of bread you buy, how it was made or where the ingredients  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:40:10):**  come from. It might mean learning to bake your own bread and discovering the joy of  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:40:15):**  that process. It might mean asking your local school or your local care home to serve real

**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:40:32):**  All of these acts have knock-on effects. They have the potential to ripple outwards. Getting  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-6-grain-futures#t=0:40:38):**  involved could also start with spreading the word about good bread. And on that note, we're

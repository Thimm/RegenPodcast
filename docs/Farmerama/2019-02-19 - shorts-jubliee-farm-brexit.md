## Shorts: Jubliee Farm Brexit  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:00):**  So we're back at Jubilee Farm. We've just moved on site having raised Â£280,000 to buy  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:09):**  this wonderful farm. And it's an interesting time to be setting up a farm because there  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:14):**  are storm clouds on the horizon with Brexit and what it is going to mean for agriculture.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:20):**  And particularly here in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK that has a land border  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:24):**  with the EU. There are a lot of questions about what it's going to look like for agriculture  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:29):**  in the future and questions that we're asking as a small community farm setting up for the  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:36):**  first time.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:39):**  So to think about some of those questions and the challenges of Brexit for Northern  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:43):**  Irish agriculture and the small family farms that dominate our farming profession here.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:48):**  And joined this month by Conor McCauley who is the BBC's correspondent in Northern Ireland  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:54):**  for food and farming and the environment. So Conor thanks for joining us.  
**[0:00:59-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:59):**  You're welcome.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:00:59):**  What are the challenges that Brexit poses to farming here?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:03):**  Well that's a pretty big question. The main farm union we have here, the Uster Farmers  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:08):**  Union has been pretty categoric about the challenges. Not so much of Brexit but of a  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:13):**  no deal Brexit. They have said consistently all the way along they're not against Brexit  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:19):**  per se but it's the prospect of a no deal Brexit that really worries them. And they  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:24):**  have said in no uncertain terms in recent weeks in fact that the outworking of a no  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:30):**  deal Brexit for farms in Northern Ireland and as you say we have predominantly small  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:36):**  family farms, a lot of livestock based farming here would be catastrophic. And the reason  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:42):**  for that is essentially that the trading relationships in a no deal scenario which is what we appear  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:49):**  to be facing into at the moment as best we know anyway would mean that it would be very  
**[0:01:53-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:01:53):**  difficult for particularly sheep and dairy sectors here and beef of course as well, the  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:03):**  potential for restrictions on cross border movements because a lot of our supply chains  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:08):**  here in Northern Ireland are essentially all island based supply chains. So we send a lot  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:14):**  of meat to the south, live animals to the south to be slaughtered. We send a lot of  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:19):**  milk to the south to be processed. We bring a lot of pigs into Northern Ireland from the  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:23):**  Republic of Ireland for processing here. So there's a great deal of integration of the  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:27):**  supply chains in Northern Ireland and anything that's going to disrupt those is potentially  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:33):**  going to have as the Ulster Farmers Union has said catastrophic implications and is  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:39):**  really going to potentially hit farm incomes. And as we know farm incomes are not big incomes  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:45):**  by any manner of means and of course particularly here in Northern Ireland they are heavily  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:49):**  dependent on existing EU subsidies.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:52):**  Yeah and that's one of the things moving forward we've projected some subsidy income for a  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:02:57):**  couple of years but in terms of capital expenditure when we need to build a new barn we haven't  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:01):**  factored in any EU money and in the short term buying pig feed from the Republic, organic  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:06):**  pig feed, the currency fluctuations are playing havoc a bit in terms of budgeting and that  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:10):**  sort of thing. We were talking just beforehand about the problems Northern Ireland faces  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:14):**  at the moment not having a current executive in place. Why is that so important for post  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:21):**  Brexit agriculture in Northern Ireland in terms of having that functioning executive  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:24):**  there?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:25):**  Well it's critically important for farmers to have the executive back because essentially  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:28):**  agriculture is a devolved matter. Now we do have an agriculture bill going through Westminster  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:34):**  at the moment but that is essentially a bill for England essentially which we're kind of  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:41):**  tacking ourselves onto because we don't have a functioning executive here in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:45):**  So essentially what we're doing in terms of the agriculture bill that's going through  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:48):**  Westminster at the moment is that officials at the Department of Agriculture here in Northern  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:54):**  Ireland are ensuring that the law is set in such a way that essentially they can keep  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:03:59):**  the thing rolling forward without basically making any big changes to what happens in  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:04):**  the short term with a view to the restoration of the Northern Ireland executive, the appointment  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:10):**  of a locally devolved agriculture minister essentially and someone who can then set the  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:16):**  direction for agriculture policy in Northern Ireland because agriculture is a devolved  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:20):**  matter. We need our own policy. We need our own minister to set our own policy. Civil  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:25):**  servants say we can't set the direction of policy. Only a minister can do that. So and  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:31):**  there is the bones of a policy there. We had a big consultation document not that long  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:35):**  ago which set out the shape of a potential future policy for Northern Ireland but the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:40):**  reality is that has been consulted upon. The consultation responses are in the department  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:45):**  but the department cannot really do anything more with that in terms of setting a policy  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:50):**  until we get an agriculture minister back and that person then decides what way we're  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:04:56):**  going to go locally because the reality is what would work for England will not necessarily  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:00):**  work for us because the structures of farming are much different. The climate challenges  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:05):**  are much different. So to finish up from Jubilee Farm this month, Mark Twain famously said  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:12):**  buy land, they're not making it anymore and so we're hoping that whatever shade of Brexit  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:17):**  happens in the next few months we're betting the farmer here at Jubilee Farm in Northern  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:21):**  Ireland that for this farm and for all the others that we're going to have a productive  
**[0:05:26-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubliee-farm-brexit#t=0:05:26):**  and sustainable future in agriculture.

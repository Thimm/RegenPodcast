**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:00):**  Is the way we produce our food today sustainable?  No, it's not at all. At least the big part of the food we are eating is processed food.  And the thought between or the idea to have sustainable food has to include many more things than just the end product.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:27):**  It has to look at the way it has been produced, because that is important for the future.  If we talk of sustainability, it means is it lasting for long?  And if we look at our soil today, it's almost dead.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:41):**  You are producing more, we are producing in our industrial agriculture,  in a way that the soil is losing more and more its capacity of giving us the food we need.  Industrial agriculture, what has been like the top errors, the top mistakes that we have taken with the industrial food system in the last decades?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:06):**  I think the biggest error was that we nurture the plant and not the soil.  The principle of organic farming and of sustainable agriculture is that you nurture and defeat the soil, not the plant.  If you look at greenhouses in the Netherlands, all the tomatoes are produced in the liquid, which is a chemical solution.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:28):**  And you cannot expect a tomato to be tasty if you are feeding it with chemicals.  So we have to have a very close look to the soil.  In many parts of Europe and in the world, it has been treated like a machine.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:44):**  And soil is a living creature. Soil has a lot of different lives in it.  And we have to invest there. We have to do science and research much more about how the soil is nurturing the plant.  Also how plants are communicating with each other.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:02):**  The idea of industrial farming has been brutal.  It has taken the idea that we just have to produce a chemical and from that chemical we produce our food.  This is unhealthy. This is not sustainable.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:21):**  It's very dangerous because if we want to feed 9 billion people, we will not be able to do that in the next decades.  But a lot is being said about the role of consumer and the role of cities.  Cities from one side are the places where the future happens.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:42):**  So if it's a good future or a bad future, this is where citizens can influence processes.  Do you observe a trend or a new wave of understanding around those issues in cities?  Do you have experience in policy over the last couple of decades?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:03):**  Have you seen an evolution of people's awareness?  Do you see the current times where you have new models of decision making, new technological opportunities and tools?  Do you see a window of opportunity to reverse these destructive trends and eroding trends?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:25):**  Do we have time? Is there still a chance? What role and for whom?  Well, if you look at the problems you might get a bit depressive about the future.  But I think that's not the way. We have to look at all the possibilities that are now coming up and emerging.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:43):**  I think one very encouraging development is that you have groups of consumers that see themselves as co-producers.  As those who are aware that what they demand from farmers will change farmers' habits.  I think that's a very encouraging approach and that emerges everywhere.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:05):**  The other thing is that you need a kind of approach or approaching between rural and urban areas.  I think we need the rural to come closer to the cities and the cities coming closer to the rural.  The dependence of both from each other is very important.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:31):**  So we should look at all the initiatives that exist in urban gardening.  So all the people and all the cities that have understood that the city needs to have this element of experience of food production.  And we need more the critical views of people from the cities in the rural areas.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:53):**  They should really go out and talk to the farmers.  And we should create a space where this communication can take place.  And if I say we should, it's not just a wish, it's organizing it.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:09):**  We have to organize it. When farmers organize open days, we should mobilize for it.  And we should create a language of understanding between farmers and consumers.  I think many environmental organizations have made a great error in just saying, accusing farmers of being the polluters.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:29):**  You stop a thinking process if you attack.  You should offer, or we should offer as consumers, a way of I'm ready to support you, farmer,  in your difficult situation. I'm ready to overcome your loneliness on the tractor.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:49):**  I'm ready to take your products on a longer period.  And I think the movements that offer farmers for a longer period to take their products to a fair price  are encouraging many farmers to think differently and to practice differently.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:15):**  And they get out of the stress situation of having to produce ever more in order to get a fair price.  So this is the beginning of a new system, I think.  And does this new system, those new urban-rural connections, do you think it can provide a positive narrative for European citizens today?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:34):**  We experience big parts of the population feeling neglected, which is sometimes reflected in getting organized  in very reactive and even violent narratives.  We see the rise of populism. We see the rise of extremism around Europe.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:52):**  Do you think that this new connection of humans with the land, but also of rural with urban population,  can provide a new hopeful narrative which we can construct, you know, messages of unity rather than separation?  It is not just hopeful, it's absolutely necessary.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:11):**  I think we should be aware that not only in the United States, but also here in Europe,  the rural population is extremely frustrated and has shown it through the elections and following populists.  You cannot accuse them for that. It's a warning sign for us that we have to, as mainly urban population,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:37):**  we have to go out back to the countryside and understand what's happening there.  And I think it's very important that we propose things like excursions for children to rural areas,  excursions of people working in administrations to see what is happening in the countryside  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:54):**  and to show farmers that it matters what farmers are doing.  So it's not just the consumer that should be targeted, it should be the people who can learn from what is happening in rural areas.  So the focus should be let's reconnect urban and rural people, people, not just structures, people,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:08:23):**  and reinvent markets, reinvent the way we are producing and valuing food, which we all need.

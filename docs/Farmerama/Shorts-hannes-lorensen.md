**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:00):**  Is the way we produce our food today sustainable?  
**[0:00:07-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:07):**  No, it's not at all. At least the big part of the food we are eating is processed food.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:14):**  And the thought between or the idea to have sustainable food has to include many more things than just the end product.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:27):**  It has to look at the way it has been produced, because that is important for the future.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:33):**  If we talk of sustainability, it means is it lasting for long?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:37):**  And if we look at our soil today, it's almost dead.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:41):**  You are producing more, we are producing in our industrial agriculture,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:45):**  in a way that the soil is losing more and more its capacity of giving us the food we need.  
**[0:00:53-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:00:53):**  Industrial agriculture, what has been like the top errors, the top mistakes that we have taken with the industrial food system in the last decades?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:06):**  I think the biggest error was that we nurture the plant and not the soil.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:12):**  The principle of organic farming and of sustainable agriculture is that you nurture and defeat the soil, not the plant.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:19):**  If you look at greenhouses in the Netherlands, all the tomatoes are produced in the liquid, which is a chemical solution.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:28):**  And you cannot expect a tomato to be tasty if you are feeding it with chemicals.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:34):**  So we have to have a very close look to the soil.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:39):**  In many parts of Europe and in the world, it has been treated like a machine.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:44):**  And soil is a living creature. Soil has a lot of different lives in it.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:49):**  And we have to invest there. We have to do science and research much more about how the soil is nurturing the plant.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:01:58):**  Also how plants are communicating with each other.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:02):**  The idea of industrial farming has been brutal.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:06):**  It has taken the idea that we just have to produce a chemical and from that chemical we produce our food.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:17):**  This is unhealthy. This is not sustainable.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:21):**  It's very dangerous because if we want to feed 9 billion people, we will not be able to do that in the next decades.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:31):**  But a lot is being said about the role of consumer and the role of cities.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:38):**  Cities from one side are the places where the future happens.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:42):**  So if it's a good future or a bad future, this is where citizens can influence processes.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:49):**  Do you observe a trend or a new wave of understanding around those issues in cities?  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:02:56):**  Do you have experience in policy over the last couple of decades?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:03):**  Have you seen an evolution of people's awareness?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:06):**  Do you see the current times where you have new models of decision making, new technological opportunities and tools?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:18):**  Do you see a window of opportunity to reverse these destructive trends and eroding trends?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:25):**  Do we have time? Is there still a chance? What role and for whom?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:31):**  Well, if you look at the problems you might get a bit depressive about the future.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:37):**  But I think that's not the way. We have to look at all the possibilities that are now coming up and emerging.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:43):**  I think one very encouraging development is that you have groups of consumers that see themselves as co-producers.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:03:53):**  As those who are aware that what they demand from farmers will change farmers' habits.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:00):**  I think that's a very encouraging approach and that emerges everywhere.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:05):**  The other thing is that you need a kind of approach or approaching between rural and urban areas.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:17):**  I think we need the rural to come closer to the cities and the cities coming closer to the rural.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:25):**  The dependence of both from each other is very important.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:31):**  So we should look at all the initiatives that exist in urban gardening.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:37):**  So all the people and all the cities that have understood that the city needs to have this element of experience of food production.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:46):**  And we need more the critical views of people from the cities in the rural areas.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:53):**  They should really go out and talk to the farmers.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:04:56):**  And we should create a space where this communication can take place.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:01):**  And if I say we should, it's not just a wish, it's organizing it.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:09):**  We have to organize it. When farmers organize open days, we should mobilize for it.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:15):**  And we should create a language of understanding between farmers and consumers.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:22):**  I think many environmental organizations have made a great error in just saying, accusing farmers of being the polluters.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:29):**  You stop a thinking process if you attack.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:33):**  You should offer, or we should offer as consumers, a way of I'm ready to support you, farmer,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:44):**  in your difficult situation. I'm ready to overcome your loneliness on the tractor.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:49):**  I'm ready to take your products on a longer period.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:05:54):**  And I think the movements that offer farmers for a longer period to take their products to a fair price  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:08):**  are encouraging many farmers to think differently and to practice differently.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:15):**  And they get out of the stress situation of having to produce ever more in order to get a fair price.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:22):**  So this is the beginning of a new system, I think.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:26):**  And does this new system, those new urban-rural connections, do you think it can provide a positive narrative for European citizens today?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:34):**  We experience big parts of the population feeling neglected, which is sometimes reflected in getting organized  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:42):**  in very reactive and even violent narratives.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:47):**  We see the rise of populism. We see the rise of extremism around Europe.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:52):**  Do you think that this new connection of humans with the land, but also of rural with urban population,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:06:59):**  can provide a new hopeful narrative which we can construct, you know, messages of unity rather than separation?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:08):**  It is not just hopeful, it's absolutely necessary.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:11):**  I think we should be aware that not only in the United States, but also here in Europe,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:17):**  the rural population is extremely frustrated and has shown it through the elections and following populists.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:24):**  You cannot accuse them for that. It's a warning sign for us that we have to, as mainly urban population,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:37):**  we have to go out back to the countryside and understand what's happening there.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:42):**  And I think it's very important that we propose things like excursions for children to rural areas,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:49):**  excursions of people working in administrations to see what is happening in the countryside  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:07:54):**  and to show farmers that it matters what farmers are doing.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:08:00):**  So it's not just the consumer that should be targeted, it should be the people who can learn from what is happening in rural areas.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:08:14):**  So the focus should be let's reconnect urban and rural people, people, not just structures, people,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/grow-janes-lorensen#t=0:08:23):**  and reinvent markets, reinvent the way we are producing and valuing food, which we all need.

### Farmerama  (Sat, 25 Mar 2017 17:57:05)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to FarmerArmor. This week we start with a trip to Abraham Organics,  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:08):**  a specialist halal and ta'ev meat supplier in London. We learn about the work of the  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:12):**  Open Food Network from Lynn Davis and Mark Harrison. Then we're visiting two old friends  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:17):**  of the show, first Ed Hamer with some practical vegetable growing advice, and we'll end the  
**[0:00:22-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:22):**  show with Ben Raskin from the Soil Association. He's taken a visit to Plotgate CSA in Dorset  
**[0:00:29-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:29):**  as part of the CSA Network's mentoring programme.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:40):**  Abby is sat next to me. Hello. And a surprise for you, look who's back. It's me, hello.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:48):**  That's Nigel for new listeners to the show. Nigel where have you been? I don't think we've  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:55):**  heard from you since late last year. Well ever since pretty much the beginning of this  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:00):**  year I've been very focused on the farm. My parents have had a trip planned to go and  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:06):**  visit some relatives in New Zealand and Australia. So basically I've been in charge of the farm  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:12):**  for the last two months. So it's been pretty full on. I've not really had much time for  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:17):**  doing any extra curricular activities. So mainly farming and yeah, so basically stockwork.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:25):**  My days have consisted of looking after the cattle, looking after the sheep, feeding,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:30):**  bedding down, just the sort of day to day routine of farm life in the winter. Yeah,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:37):**  I think it went pretty well and you know, mum and dad are back and they seem pleased  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:44):**  that, you know, that their animals are still there and they have a farm. So yeah. I just  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:51):**  like to say there is a helicopter circling above us at the moment. It's been here for  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:56):**  the last two hours. We were hoping it was going to go away. So we apologise this month  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:02):**  if this interferes with your listening experience, but we have made 19 episodes which have all  
**[0:02:10-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:10):**  come out on time and we're not about to let that slip.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:34):**  Abraham Organics are a specialist halal and Thai meat supplier based on the outskirts  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:38):**  of South East London in Keystone, Kent. They pride themselves on working closely with suppliers  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:44):**  and producers to make sure everyone gets a fair deal, including farmers, wholesalers  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:49):**  and even the cows. We chat to one of its partners, Masin Hassanin, to find out more.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:55):**  It started quite a few years ago now, if I'm correct, it's probably nine years ago now  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:59):**  and it was under an instructor of one of our spiritual teachers who said, you know, the  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:05):**  meat quality is very bad. This would be a good business. Go out and enquire and make  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:09):**  this happen. And then eventually it was taken over by my current business partner, Zeki  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:13):**  and his wife. They were running it for about four years without us. And then we've now  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:18):**  come on board, me and another partner have come on board to promote it and move it forward  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:24):**  because we believe that, you know, it's actually an ethical obligation for Muslims to eat meat  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:30):**  that is halal but also something called ta'ib, which means wholesome. You can go anywhere  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:36):**  in the country and see halal signs. You can go to any place and find halal meat, but the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:41):**  ta'ib, which is also always attached to halal in the Quran or the injunction, the religious  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:46):**  injunction is not there. And the wholesome element, how the animals are raised, how they're  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:51):**  treated, what they're fed, all these questions that the scholars previously would actually  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:57):**  wouldn't even eat animals that had been traded by somebody who was a fortune teller, for  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:02):**  example, or somebody who had a negative quality, you know, and it was that scrupulous. I don't  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:10):**  want to be associated with something that is harmful to the environment, to people,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:17):**  and ultimately myself. I do take that very seriously. And then I've also become a smallholder  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:23):**  and I want to create food. If we're thinking about putting weight on animals, if we're  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:27):**  thinking about how much I get a market, if we're thinking about all these things, how  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:30):**  do I maintain my business, when do I not get bankrupt, debt, etc., etc., it's the incorrect  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:34):**  paradigm. It's going to take a revolutionary shift, but Brexit, Trump, you know, these  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:40):**  things are big revolutionary things that I think are moving towards. And the halal market  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:44):**  commands so much money in the world. We have to get this right. And I think a lot of compromise  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:49):**  has happened in the halal market that shouldn't be there. And the Muslim community and the  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:54):**  way that we've got used to cheap meat because of being an immigrant culture to the West  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:57):**  and having no money, you know, my parents came here with nothing. My mum wasn't even  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:01):**  Muslim, she became Muslim in London. But my dad came here literally, you know, he was  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:05):**  working in a car park, he had nothing. And they had to make do. There was one halal shop  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:10):**  and it cost this much and that was it. You were happy to get meat that wasn't pork or,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:15):**  you know, so and that's become a culture. But now we're wising up. We've got a middle  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:19):**  class, a growing middle class Muslim community. A lot of our customers, doctors, lawyers,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:24):**  judges, you know, Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London. It's a prominent part of London  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:30):**  life, a prominent part of the UK life to be British and Muslim, have a countryside farmer  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:36):**  who's Muslim, smallholders that are Muslim, it's growing. So I think I'm part of the  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:39):**  beginning of the halal, part of the halal farming movement and control of the process  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:45):**  of slaughter. And another big thing actually I have to mention is slaughter is not talked  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:50):**  about at all. And people have so many misconceptions about halal slaughter. It's like, oh, we don't  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:54):**  do halal slaughter. I only do the same slaughter as what the slaughterman that would be doing  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:58):**  your meat would be doing anyway. The only difference is that I'm slightly more brown  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:03):**  than that slaughterman and I prescribe to another religion. I don't do anything different.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:07):**  You make it purely, properly halal as how the prophet himself talked about it and prophet  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:12):**  Abraham is actually where we get slaughtered from. So we actually kind of copied the Jews  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:15):**  and the Christians. The reality is I know every slaughterhouse has got what we call  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:20):**  a end of line Muslim because end of line slaughterman because then they can market that meat as  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:25):**  halal if they want to and they can market that meat as non-halal if they want to. Whereas  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:29):**  a ritual slaughter is slightly different. That's when the animal's not stunned. And  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:32):**  I don't agree with that. I agree with stunning and I agree with non-stunning, but in different  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:36):**  circumstances. So we have our organic halal chicken and organic halal lamb has been certified  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:42):**  by the Saw Association, which means it must be stunned prior to killing. We use organic  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:47):**  certified abattoirs and organic certified suppliers, et cetera, et cetera. PFLAs supply  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:51):**  us and we, organic PFLAs, certified suppliers come through us and we then slaughter with  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:58):**  a stun. We also do unstunned slaughter for beef, but we also do stunned slaughter for  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:02):**  beef. But we just, if we can manage it, we work with what we can manage. And the simple  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:08):**  fact is that there's not a lot of Muslims demand, there's not a big demand for beef,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:12):**  but we've got a lot of demand for mince. So we've had to opt for a trim option, which  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:16):**  is basically buying inventory based beef that's HMC certified, sorry, unstunned beef. That's  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:23):**  stunning according to all the vets and what, you know, this slaughterhouse exists in a  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:27):**  very, you know, above board and people are very happy with the process. But that's just  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:33):**  a bone of contention for us because we don't actually like that way. My most preferred  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:38):**  option would be the Australian method, which is an electrical stun to the head and then  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:42):**  a throat slit rather than a captive bolt stun. But what abattoir is going to take that on  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:46):**  board when the electric stun probably going to be like, you know, a hundred grand for  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:49):**  the machine or something. Maybe we can get investors or do something and just work with  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:53):**  it. That would be my preferred option. And then we can have organic certified stunned  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:57):**  cattle. The way people believe or think about religion is in a dogmatic understanding of  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:04):**  this top down controlling people. And I disagree with that type of religion. And that is a  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:08):**  problem in society. I'm not going to dismiss that, but that leads to Zighaylin the same  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:13):**  way as it leads to we kill for the sake of Allah and kill somebody because they're a  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:18):**  different religion. It's the same sickness in a human being. Whereas the traditional  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:24):**  understanding is that an animal or human being is sacred. And the fact that it's a sacrifice,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:30):**  this is the bit that's missing completely. It should be a sacrifice. What sacrifice is  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:33):**  it for people to eat meat now? They don't have any connection to that sacrifice whatsoever.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:37):**  Now I personally have a theory that if you're not prepared to kill it, you shouldn't eat  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:42):**  it. And that has informed my life now because I've said, well, if I'm eating all this,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:47):**  I've got to be prepared to kill it. And I became a slaughterman because of it. So I'm  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:50):**  not telling everybody to be as proactive. And you don't need millions of slaughtermen.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:54):**  What you need is millions of people that are willing to engage with the topic without emotion  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:59):**  and start saying, you know what? There are lots of people on this earth and we have to  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:04):**  get along. We're not going to just say liberalism and secularism is the way. There's so many  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:09):**  beauties out of liberalism and secularism. But there's so many misconceptions about  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:13):**  what religion and what that dictates. And that is a big part of the whole halal organic  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:18):**  movement. We work with a school that's catering at the moment. They were featured on BBC the  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:21):**  other day. And she's a complete pioneer. She's actually aware of Alan's Savory. She's aware  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:27):**  of all this sort of sustainable food. And she's a chef pushing whole food, whole animal  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:33):**  cooking in her Hackney School in London, Mandeville Primary School. And we supplied them. But  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:41):**  our condition was that we give her the whole bird. We can't give her inventory. Struggle  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:45):**  at first, worked out with us and got a price that she's happy with. She said, actually,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:49):**  it's not that much different to what I was paying before. She was being ripped off, to  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:52):**  be honest. And it was unfair, actually. And we're able to supply them. And to watch kids  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:58):**  that are low income families would never be eating free range animal or even because we  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:03):**  wanted to push organic, but it was a bit too much. Free range, birds that have been raised  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:08):**  outdoors had a good life, good dispatch, and they're being fed into an inner city school.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:11):**  I think big things are coming for that. To bridge the gap, I think, again, is the cooking,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:16):**  but it's also to its education. The Muslim community are 100% certain that they're not  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:21):**  happy with the non-organic side of it because we have the biggest incidences in the Pakistani  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:27):**  community. From the Pakistani community, I'm not in Pakistani community, but from their  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:30):**  own words, huge amount of disease in their community. A lot of associating factors, but  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:35):**  they have a really strong belief that it's the food they're eating. Refined flour, refined  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:40):**  sugar, refined oils. When they make a change to organic or free range animals, they're  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:46):**  avoiding antibiotics, generally. They're avoiding high amounts of soy processed feed. And they  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:53):**  believe strongly that that's a massive part of why they're sick. So I personally believe  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:57):**  that's our leverage point. Eczema, asthma, all these problems that we've got with kids  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:02):**  to really push that. We've got the schools on board. We can do something like that, promote  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:06):**  it amongst the community. And I think you have to catch the parents by the kids. Maybe  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:13):**  processed rubbish chicken and rubbish meat is okay and your kids will be fine. Maybe  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:18):**  they won't. And I do have that same feeling. It's a bubble. It's a permaculture bubble.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:22):**  You've got the permaculture bubble. You've got the grass fed bubble. You've got the PFLA  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:25):**  bubble. It's not going to go mainstream until that data comes in and then people start applying  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:31):**  a practical knowledge comes in and we can convince the movers and shakers. That's the  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:36):**  only way it's going to happen. And I think this is it. This is the time. Brexit, insecure,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:41):**  not knowing what's going on, make something happen.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:43):**  Mussin Hassanin speaking to Abby there. You can check out their website, organic-halal-meat.com.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:49):**  What do you make of that, Nigel? Halal meat. What's your take on it? Is it something that  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:56):**  you know about as a farmer, as a meat lover?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, in terms of being a farmer, it's really key. It's a huge  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:04):**  market and a growing market. And I just know from selling our sheep in market, you know,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:09):**  in the local livestock market in Hailsham, that if it wasn't for the rising demand for  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:13):**  halal meats, that sheep prices would be a lot worse. Certainly for the sort of our cold  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:18):**  ewes and some of our larger stock, larger lambs and hoggets, they wouldn't fetch near  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:23):**  the price that they do. So, yeah, I think it's a really positive thing. And you read  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:28):**  a lot of the industry magazines and they talk about halal actually offsetting some of the  
**[0:12:33-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:33):**  challenges of maybe not supplying as much meat overseas. So really positive.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:04):**  Open Food Network UK CEO, Lynne Davies, was one of the founding members of Dean Forest  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:27):**  Food Hub. She has a background in computing. And as they moved to selling online, she realised  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:34):**  that local food projects would always struggle to fund their software platforms. She discovered  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:39):**  Australian open source platform, the Open Food Network, OFN, and has teamed up with  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:46):**  other food hubs to bring it to the UK. Open Food Network provides tools for farmers markets  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:51):**  to allow their producers to sell online, as well as allowing farmers and farm shops to  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:56):**  sell direct. We hear some of the ins and outs of using the Open Food Network software from  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:03):**  Lynne and also farmer Mark Harrison, based at Stroud Community Agriculture, which was  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:10):**  one of the first producers to start using this system to help them sell online.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:15):**  My name is Lynne Davies and I'm part of the Open Food Network in the UK. So the Open Food  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:22):**  Network is essentially a bunch of web tools that are designed to help producers or communities  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:29):**  to create their own food distribution systems. Part of that is the front end side of having  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:35):**  sales, having an online platform so that you can offer sales on the internet to customers,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:41):**  take payments, things like that. The other side of that is the backend functionality  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:46):**  that gives you reporting, predictions of, you know, sales in the future based on sales  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:50):**  in the past, different kinds of administration so that you can manage your customers and  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:55):**  the contact details so you can contact them if you want to.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:58):**  At the moment, the main users have switched over from other software. So they've been  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:02):**  running food hubs where they've maybe had 60 or 80 different producers that they're  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:07):**  combining under one platform so that food eaters can go in there and order from a big  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:11):**  list of producers at once. It's been really positive. Tamar Valley Food Hubs have found  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:17):**  when they switched over, actually doubled the sales through their food hub because the  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:21):**  platform is much easier to use than what they were using before. Also, small producers that  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:25):**  have wanted to explore doing direct sales themselves and then finding that through the  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:29):**  Open Food Network, not only can they sell to their own customers, but then they can  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:33):**  access other food hubs or food distribution enterprises nearby. They can expand their  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:37):**  market without having to do that another uploading of products, managing the stock, blah, blah,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:43):**  blah. It's all managed centrally in one place. And the beauty of the Open Food Network is  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:47):**  that we actually have the capacity to scale this right up. So we could have a small producer  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:51):**  who's selling to food hub and that food hub actually distributes to a few different community  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:56):**  groups locally, or we could join together different food hubs that want to import, say,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:02):**  maybe citrus from Spain. Maybe an individual food hub isn't big enough to warrant getting  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:07):**  a pallet every week, but a few food hubs together. Another side of that is the flexibility of  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:12):**  the platform. So we don't make any demands as to what your business model should be.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:17):**  Have food control, whether you are a farmer's market that wants to add 10%, or maybe you're  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:21):**  a buying group where everybody's volunteering their time so you don't add any markup. Or  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:26):**  maybe you're actually a retail shop and you need to add a 30% markup, but you also want  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:31):**  to be able to facilitate people buying online so you can do deliveries. You know, maybe  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:36):**  people come and pick up and then you charge no delivery fee. Maybe you have home delivery  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:40):**  and you charge a delivery fee for that. So all of the fee structures mean that you can  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:44):**  create a business model that really works for your community or your enterprise. You're  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:50):**  not locked into anything else. You know, there's some rise of platforms out there like Airbnb  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:57):**  and Uber, and in some ways they're really good. They provide a service. In other ways,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:01):**  they're really concentrating power so that the owners of that software come very wealthy  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:07):**  from everybody else using it. You know, that concentration of power, like everyone else  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:12):**  in our food system, is something that we don't want to see happen. So we're running it as  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:16):**  a platform cooperative. People who are users can make decisions on how it works, including,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:21):**  you know, who gets paid what and what functionality we should be implementing next. Writing software  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:26):**  is a huge expense. If you want bespoke features, then you put a fork out quite a lot. What  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:31):**  we've done, we've recognised as the Open Food Network that actually these features are needed  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:37):**  by food producers and communities all over the world. And so the software is written  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:41):**  in a collaborative open source way, and we have groups in Australia, in Germany, in France,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:47):**  in Norway, in Sweden, in the States, in Canada, in South Africa, in Brazil, in India, you  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:51):**  know. Actually, there's people all over the world now who are contributing to the open  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:55):**  source community and helping to build new features. It's been specifically designed  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:59):**  for food. You know, there's a lot of e-commerce stuff out there, but a lot of it won't handle  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:04):**  some of the nuances when you're actually trying to sell food. So you know that you can do  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:08):**  maybe 10 bags of salad a week, or you know that in the freezer you've got, you know,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:13):**  four lambs left, and that's your stock levels. So you can limit that stock to what you actually  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:19):**  have. Say you're selling cheese or cuts of meat, but you want people to be able to order  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:24):**  in advance. Real classic problem that you don't, you know, you have different weights  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:29):**  and different cuts, and you can't actually predict in advance what they're going to be.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:34):**  So the platform allows you to have that flexibility. You can say, around about this much, and then  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:38):**  charge actually a bit more or a bit less when you have the weights in. If you wanted to  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:42):**  do group buying, so supporting things like meat shares, if you know that you get to a  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:48):**  certain order and you can send so many of your animals off to slaughter, and then, but  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:52):**  if you get a bigger order, you can send even more, you can kind of set tiers of stock levels.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:58):**  So we try to really work with giving the flexibility to what works for producers, rather than demanding  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:04):**  that producers work to the consumer. As a small scale food producer, it is really hard  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:10):**  to make a living. We all know that. Finding extra money to try out online sales is not  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:15):**  really something that people want to find the budget for. So it is based on a pay what  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:20):**  you can model. You can try it out, see if it works for you, and what we're asking is  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:24):**  that if people do find that it adds value to their business, then think about if some  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:30):**  of that value could be contributed back to the platform so that other people can use  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:33):**  it as well. In the UK at the moment, we've actually been supported by Esme Furman to  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:39):**  launch and we have funding to support food producers that want to come on board, so we're  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:44):**  able to help people get started and provide the hand holding and things like that. So  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:48):**  now is a really good time to get in touch if you want to try it out. My name is Mark  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:55):**  Harrison. I'm a grower from Stratt Community Agriculture, which is a CSA based in Gloucestershire.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:02):**  We farm 50 acres in total, but we have 7 acres of vegetables, mixed and beef and pigs and  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:09):**  sheep. The bulk of the business is through the CSA, which means that we have a very regular  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:15):**  market that we supply, but we do have surpluses in the summer, so using the OFN we've really  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:22):**  been able to sell most of our surpluses then to the local community. The CSA bit is just  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:30):**  the veg, so again we can sell the meat through the open food network and it gives us a wider  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:37):**  market within the local community. It's just once a week. It takes us an hour maybe to  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:43):**  pack it up, because the project is all there anyway. It takes another hour to drive it  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:48):**  up and drop it off. That's all it takes is two hours. It's all done for us. The people  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:52):**  pre-ordered it. We know exactly what they want the day before. We can make it up. We  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:57):**  can deliver it the night before. It's just very efficient from our point of view. Give  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:02):**  it a go.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:05):**  I is for the interest on our overdraft. J is for a jigsaw with which we go down. K is  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:12):**  for Clifton and fire. Okay, who remembers this? The wonderful voice of Ed Hamer. That's  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:19):**  right. Nigel, do you remember? Where did we hear him? We heard him at the Oxford Real  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:23):**  Farming Conference last year. It's nice to learn the back. That was from episode seven.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:33):**  Wow, do you really know that? Yeah, it's like six months since we started, because it's  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:40):**  been a long time. We've had him on the show before to talk about his policy work for the  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:43):**  Land Workers Alliance, and we've got him here again. This time he's got some tips for growing  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:47):**  courgettes in tyres and also raised green manure beds.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:53):**  We're quite unique. Chag Feud Community Market Garden in the sense that we're farming at  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:56):**  650 feet above sea level in the southwest of England. That has a significant effect  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:02):**  on the growing conditions and the length of our growing season. One of the things we noticed  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:05):**  in the first two or three years we were growing was that we would plant the courgettes and  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:10):**  squash out in the beginning of May, and we'd quite consistently have a strong north-easterly  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:14):**  wind, cold wind, that would come and buffet the young seedlings. It would often burn the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:22):**  leaves because it was a cold wind. We picked up a very useful tip from a friend, Martin  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:27):**  Godfrey, a local grower, of laying out tyres, old used tyres from garages, just out onto  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:34):**  mypex. That helps to prevent some of the leaching of the rubber into the soil. It creates a  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:40):**  windbreak around the plant, but importantly it also creates a microclimate. That tyre,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:45):**  because it's black, it heats up in the sun and it creates a warm air pocket that the  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:51):**  seedling then grows up into. It's only ready when it's big enough that it's ready to put  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:55):**  its leaves over the top of the tyre. By that stage it's resilient to the wind that we have.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:01):**  Usually by the beginning of June that wind has swung around to the southwest anyway.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:04):**  Also, it's worth pointing out that using this system, if you are going to get a late frost,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:09):**  we sometimes get a frost in June. If that was the case and we were going to get a late  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:12):**  frost, having the tyres over the squash plants means we can pull a length of fleece over  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:16):**  the whole section of the cucurbits without damaging any of the plants because they're  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:21):**  all safely protected by their own individual tyre. For us and anyone growing on an exposed  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:27):**  site or anyone at high altitude, that system works incredibly well in terms of mitigating  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:34):**  the effects of a shortened season. Again, driven by the fact that we're on a marginal  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:40):**  growing site, we need to do everything we can to be able to get onto the ground earlier  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:44):**  in the spring in order to get the early crops, the potatoes and onions, into the ground and  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:48):**  get that ground cultivated. We've discovered almost by accident over the past three or  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:52):**  four years that if we ridge up the ground in any spare ground that we're going to put  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:58):**  a winter green manure on in the autumn, so in September, October, we ridge up that area  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:04):**  and then broadcast a green manure onto ridges. You can do it either using a potato plough,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:08):**  we've done it with a horse-drawn implement. You're then overwintering on ridges and what  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:13):**  it means is that by the spring, those ridges actually drain the soil much better than you  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:18):**  would on the flat soil. It also means because the ground is ridged, it has a bigger surface  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:23):**  area, a larger surface area than flat ground and those ridges actually warm up a lot quicker  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:28):**  in the early spring sunshine. As a result, we think typically we're able to get on the  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:32):**  ground a couple of weeks earlier and we simply drive over those ridges with a disc harrow  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:36):**  and open them up and you're basically incorporating the green manure as you go but you've got  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:41):**  a really nice fluffy tilth inside those ridges that's dry, it's warm and it can be a matter  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:46):**  of two or three passes with the disc harrows over those overwintered ridges and then you've  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:50):**  got a good enough tilth to go straight in and put the potatoes. So we think by doing  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:54):**  that it's probably saved us a couple of weeks at the start of the season for the last couple  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:58):**  of years.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:59):**  Now for another friend of the show, Ben Raskin of the Soil Association. He visited Plotgate  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:25):**  CSA, part of the CSA network. The voices you hear, other than Ben's, belong to Amy, Dan  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:31):**  and Jane at Plotgate.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:34):**  So tell us what's going on here.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:35):**  We're about a year old. We set the CSR say up last spring. We are growing vegetables  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:41):**  in a field in Somerset.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:45):**  We had a walk around this morning and one of the things that struck me was the way you've  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:49):**  designed the growing system. So you've got raised beds but also running on contours.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:55):**  So talk me through the process of that decision process.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:59):**  One of the ideas is to try and minimise mechanisation. So we're trying to work out a way to grow  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:05):**  without tractors and we're trying to retain as much of the moisture, the rainfall and  
**[0:26:11-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:11):**  the fertility to try and work towards what we think is a truly sustainable food system  
**[0:26:21-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:21):**  that is both low input and accessible to most people to be able to participate in the process  
**[0:26:31-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:31):**  of growing with the mind to create a community driven food system as opposed to an industrial  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:39):**  food system.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:40):**  And at the moment you're growing on about an acre and a half, is that right?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:45):**  About an acre and a half.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:47):**  And you're  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:48):**  About two and a half.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah. So how are you getting from pasture to raised bed without mechanisation?  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:55):**  Firstly we've got some pigs. They're very sweet little creatures that are digging over  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:01):**  the pasture, rooting out all the perennial weeds, particularly the dandelions which is  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:07):**  one of our biggest problems and the thistles. They're on there for about a year and we  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:13):**  will then move them onto another patch which we'll be doing next year and that leaves the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:17):**  ground really nice and clean for then sculpting the raised beds of which we're developing  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:25):**  hand powered tools which facilitate the process of moving the soil.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:30):**  Yeah, so all the beds are four foot wide and five foot centre to centre on the paths either  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:36):**  side so the tool that we're developing is basically a two person push tool that allows  
**[0:27:43-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:43):**  you to cultivate and to use different tooling attachments in order to run up and down the  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:51):**  beds as two people pushing in an upright position which obviously is much better in terms of  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:57):**  the ergonomics of growing than bending over a hoe and allows you to make the most of those  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:04):**  kind of weather windows when the conditions are right for hoeing and to get round a lot  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:10):**  more of the garden much more quickly.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:13):**  So what drove you to set up as a CSA rather than a commercial, more traditional vegetable  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:21):**  growing operation?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:22):**  Well I've certainly come to horticulture through a CSA and just really, really loved the way  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:32):**  that CSAs try to connect people with the places where their food's grown, with how their food's  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:37):**  grown, the opportunities that it offers people to understand more about that process, to  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:43):**  be involved with that process without having to take on the full responsibility of growing  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:48):**  stuff for themselves.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:49):**  It's more fun doing it with other people, I can't imagine that I would want to grow  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:53):**  if I was by myself in a field and also it's about education, it's about trying to engage  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:00):**  people with the food debate, so yeah for us a CSA was the obvious choice and it's also  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:07):**  about short supply chains and being able to sell direct to people, yeah it's been really  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:12):**  important.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:13):**  And it's about building resilience as well, if you have just the right level of connection  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:19):**  between various things within a system then that builds the local resilience and ultimately  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:24):**  the resilience of the food system from an economic, ecological and the social aspects,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:30):**  these are all very important to build up this day and age if I may put it that way and this  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:36):**  model seemed to me from having observed various others, this one was a shining example of  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:41):**  resilience in action, so it's the sort of thing that makes you very much want to be  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:45):**  part of that and I hope that other people will also want to be part of that and come  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:51):**  and join in in some way locally and that's really what we're all about is encouraging  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:57):**  that participation in the process of doing our shares of veg every week in the pub and  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:03):**  by delivery.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:05):**  Thank you for that Ben, the Plotgate visit was part of the CSA Network Mentoring Programme  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:10):**  which is a really great scheme offered by the CSA Network in the UK and they still have  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:14):**  funding left for more mentoring days in England so do get in touch.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:20):**  And we also wanted to let you know that Ben has two new books out, the first is the Community  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:24):**  Gardening Handbook which does pretty much what it says on the tin and he's got another

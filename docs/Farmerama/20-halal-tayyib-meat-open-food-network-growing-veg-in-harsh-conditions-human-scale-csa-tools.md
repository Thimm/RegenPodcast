**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to FarmerArmor. This week we start with a trip to Abraham Organics,  a specialist halal and ta'ev meat supplier in London. We learn about the work of the  Open Food Network from Lynn Davis and Mark Harrison. Then we're visiting two old friends  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:17):**  of the show, first Ed Hamer with some practical vegetable growing advice, and we'll end the  show with Ben Raskin from the Soil Association. He's taken a visit to Plotgate CSA in Dorset  as part of the CSA Network's mentoring programme.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:00:40):**  Abby is sat next to me. Hello. And a surprise for you, look who's back. It's me, hello.  That's Nigel for new listeners to the show. Nigel where have you been? I don't think we've  heard from you since late last year. Well ever since pretty much the beginning of this  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:00):**  year I've been very focused on the farm. My parents have had a trip planned to go and  visit some relatives in New Zealand and Australia. So basically I've been in charge of the farm  for the last two months. So it's been pretty full on. I've not really had much time for  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:17):**  doing any extra curricular activities. So mainly farming and yeah, so basically stockwork.  My days have consisted of looking after the cattle, looking after the sheep, feeding,  bedding down, just the sort of day to day routine of farm life in the winter. Yeah,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:37):**  I think it went pretty well and you know, mum and dad are back and they seem pleased  that, you know, that their animals are still there and they have a farm. So yeah. I just  like to say there is a helicopter circling above us at the moment. It's been here for  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:01:56):**  the last two hours. We were hoping it was going to go away. So we apologise this month  if this interferes with your listening experience, but we have made 19 episodes which have all  come out on time and we're not about to let that slip.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:34):**  Abraham Organics are a specialist halal and Thai meat supplier based on the outskirts  of South East London in Keystone, Kent. They pride themselves on working closely with suppliers  and producers to make sure everyone gets a fair deal, including farmers, wholesalers  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:02:49):**  and even the cows. We chat to one of its partners, Masin Hassanin, to find out more.  It started quite a few years ago now, if I'm correct, it's probably nine years ago now  and it was under an instructor of one of our spiritual teachers who said, you know, the  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:05):**  meat quality is very bad. This would be a good business. Go out and enquire and make  this happen. And then eventually it was taken over by my current business partner, Zeki  and his wife. They were running it for about four years without us. And then we've now  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:18):**  come on board, me and another partner have come on board to promote it and move it forward  because we believe that, you know, it's actually an ethical obligation for Muslims to eat meat  that is halal but also something called ta'ib, which means wholesome. You can go anywhere  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:36):**  in the country and see halal signs. You can go to any place and find halal meat, but the  ta'ib, which is also always attached to halal in the Quran or the injunction, the religious  injunction is not there. And the wholesome element, how the animals are raised, how they're  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:03:51):**  treated, what they're fed, all these questions that the scholars previously would actually  wouldn't even eat animals that had been traded by somebody who was a fortune teller, for  example, or somebody who had a negative quality, you know, and it was that scrupulous. I don't  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:10):**  want to be associated with something that is harmful to the environment, to people,  and ultimately myself. I do take that very seriously. And then I've also become a smallholder  and I want to create food. If we're thinking about putting weight on animals, if we're  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:27):**  thinking about how much I get a market, if we're thinking about all these things, how  do I maintain my business, when do I not get bankrupt, debt, etc., etc., it's the incorrect  paradigm. It's going to take a revolutionary shift, but Brexit, Trump, you know, these  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:40):**  things are big revolutionary things that I think are moving towards. And the halal market  commands so much money in the world. We have to get this right. And I think a lot of compromise  has happened in the halal market that shouldn't be there. And the Muslim community and the  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:04:54):**  way that we've got used to cheap meat because of being an immigrant culture to the West  and having no money, you know, my parents came here with nothing. My mum wasn't even  Muslim, she became Muslim in London. But my dad came here literally, you know, he was  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:05):**  working in a car park, he had nothing. And they had to make do. There was one halal shop  and it cost this much and that was it. You were happy to get meat that wasn't pork or,  you know, so and that's become a culture. But now we're wising up. We've got a middle  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:19):**  class, a growing middle class Muslim community. A lot of our customers, doctors, lawyers,  judges, you know, Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London. It's a prominent part of London  life, a prominent part of the UK life to be British and Muslim, have a countryside farmer  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:36):**  who's Muslim, smallholders that are Muslim, it's growing. So I think I'm part of the  beginning of the halal, part of the halal farming movement and control of the process  of slaughter. And another big thing actually I have to mention is slaughter is not talked  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:05:50):**  about at all. And people have so many misconceptions about halal slaughter. It's like, oh, we don't  do halal slaughter. I only do the same slaughter as what the slaughterman that would be doing  your meat would be doing anyway. The only difference is that I'm slightly more brown  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:03):**  than that slaughterman and I prescribe to another religion. I don't do anything different.  You make it purely, properly halal as how the prophet himself talked about it and prophet  Abraham is actually where we get slaughtered from. So we actually kind of copied the Jews  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:15):**  and the Christians. The reality is I know every slaughterhouse has got what we call  a end of line Muslim because end of line slaughterman because then they can market that meat as  halal if they want to and they can market that meat as non-halal if they want to. Whereas  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:29):**  a ritual slaughter is slightly different. That's when the animal's not stunned. And  I don't agree with that. I agree with stunning and I agree with non-stunning, but in different  circumstances. So we have our organic halal chicken and organic halal lamb has been certified  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:42):**  by the Saw Association, which means it must be stunned prior to killing. We use organic  certified abattoirs and organic certified suppliers, et cetera, et cetera. PFLAs supply  us and we, organic PFLAs, certified suppliers come through us and we then slaughter with  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:06:58):**  a stun. We also do unstunned slaughter for beef, but we also do stunned slaughter for  beef. But we just, if we can manage it, we work with what we can manage. And the simple  fact is that there's not a lot of Muslims demand, there's not a big demand for beef,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:12):**  but we've got a lot of demand for mince. So we've had to opt for a trim option, which  is basically buying inventory based beef that's HMC certified, sorry, unstunned beef. That's  stunning according to all the vets and what, you know, this slaughterhouse exists in a  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:27):**  very, you know, above board and people are very happy with the process. But that's just  a bone of contention for us because we don't actually like that way. My most preferred  option would be the Australian method, which is an electrical stun to the head and then  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:42):**  a throat slit rather than a captive bolt stun. But what abattoir is going to take that on  board when the electric stun probably going to be like, you know, a hundred grand for  the machine or something. Maybe we can get investors or do something and just work with  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:07:53):**  it. That would be my preferred option. And then we can have organic certified stunned  cattle. The way people believe or think about religion is in a dogmatic understanding of  this top down controlling people. And I disagree with that type of religion. And that is a  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:08):**  problem in society. I'm not going to dismiss that, but that leads to Zighaylin the same  way as it leads to we kill for the sake of Allah and kill somebody because they're a  different religion. It's the same sickness in a human being. Whereas the traditional  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:24):**  understanding is that an animal or human being is sacred. And the fact that it's a sacrifice,  this is the bit that's missing completely. It should be a sacrifice. What sacrifice is  it for people to eat meat now? They don't have any connection to that sacrifice whatsoever.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:37):**  Now I personally have a theory that if you're not prepared to kill it, you shouldn't eat  it. And that has informed my life now because I've said, well, if I'm eating all this,  I've got to be prepared to kill it. And I became a slaughterman because of it. So I'm  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:08:50):**  not telling everybody to be as proactive. And you don't need millions of slaughtermen.  What you need is millions of people that are willing to engage with the topic without emotion  and start saying, you know what? There are lots of people on this earth and we have to  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:04):**  get along. We're not going to just say liberalism and secularism is the way. There's so many  beauties out of liberalism and secularism. But there's so many misconceptions about  what religion and what that dictates. And that is a big part of the whole halal organic  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:18):**  movement. We work with a school that's catering at the moment. They were featured on BBC the  other day. And she's a complete pioneer. She's actually aware of Alan's Savory. She's aware  of all this sort of sustainable food. And she's a chef pushing whole food, whole animal  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:33):**  cooking in her Hackney School in London, Mandeville Primary School. And we supplied them. But  our condition was that we give her the whole bird. We can't give her inventory. Struggle  at first, worked out with us and got a price that she's happy with. She said, actually,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:09:49):**  it's not that much different to what I was paying before. She was being ripped off, to  be honest. And it was unfair, actually. And we're able to supply them. And to watch kids  that are low income families would never be eating free range animal or even because we  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:03):**  wanted to push organic, but it was a bit too much. Free range, birds that have been raised  outdoors had a good life, good dispatch, and they're being fed into an inner city school.  I think big things are coming for that. To bridge the gap, I think, again, is the cooking,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:16):**  but it's also to its education. The Muslim community are 100% certain that they're not  happy with the non-organic side of it because we have the biggest incidences in the Pakistani  community. From the Pakistani community, I'm not in Pakistani community, but from their  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:30):**  own words, huge amount of disease in their community. A lot of associating factors, but  they have a really strong belief that it's the food they're eating. Refined flour, refined  sugar, refined oils. When they make a change to organic or free range animals, they're  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:10:46):**  avoiding antibiotics, generally. They're avoiding high amounts of soy processed feed. And they  believe strongly that that's a massive part of why they're sick. So I personally believe  that's our leverage point. Eczema, asthma, all these problems that we've got with kids  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:02):**  to really push that. We've got the schools on board. We can do something like that, promote  it amongst the community. And I think you have to catch the parents by the kids. Maybe  processed rubbish chicken and rubbish meat is okay and your kids will be fine. Maybe  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:18):**  they won't. And I do have that same feeling. It's a bubble. It's a permaculture bubble.  You've got the permaculture bubble. You've got the grass fed bubble. You've got the PFLA  bubble. It's not going to go mainstream until that data comes in and then people start applying  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:31):**  a practical knowledge comes in and we can convince the movers and shakers. That's the  only way it's going to happen. And I think this is it. This is the time. Brexit, insecure,  not knowing what's going on, make something happen.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:43):**  Mussin Hassanin speaking to Abby there. You can check out their website, organic-halal-meat.com.  What do you make of that, Nigel? Halal meat. What's your take on it? Is it something that  you know about as a farmer, as a meat lover?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, in terms of being a farmer, it's really key. It's a huge  market and a growing market. And I just know from selling our sheep in market, you know,  in the local livestock market in Hailsham, that if it wasn't for the rising demand for  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:13):**  halal meats, that sheep prices would be a lot worse. Certainly for the sort of our cold  ewes and some of our larger stock, larger lambs and hoggets, they wouldn't fetch near  the price that they do. So, yeah, I think it's a really positive thing. And you read  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:12:28):**  a lot of the industry magazines and they talk about halal actually offsetting some of the  challenges of maybe not supplying as much meat overseas. So really positive.  Open Food Network UK CEO, Lynne Davies, was one of the founding members of Dean Forest  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:27):**  Food Hub. She has a background in computing. And as they moved to selling online, she realised  that local food projects would always struggle to fund their software platforms. She discovered  Australian open source platform, the Open Food Network, OFN, and has teamed up with  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:13:46):**  other food hubs to bring it to the UK. Open Food Network provides tools for farmers markets  to allow their producers to sell online, as well as allowing farmers and farm shops to  sell direct. We hear some of the ins and outs of using the Open Food Network software from  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:03):**  Lynne and also farmer Mark Harrison, based at Stroud Community Agriculture, which was  one of the first producers to start using this system to help them sell online.  My name is Lynne Davies and I'm part of the Open Food Network in the UK. So the Open Food  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:22):**  Network is essentially a bunch of web tools that are designed to help producers or communities  to create their own food distribution systems. Part of that is the front end side of having  sales, having an online platform so that you can offer sales on the internet to customers,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:41):**  take payments, things like that. The other side of that is the backend functionality  that gives you reporting, predictions of, you know, sales in the future based on sales  in the past, different kinds of administration so that you can manage your customers and  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:14:55):**  the contact details so you can contact them if you want to.  At the moment, the main users have switched over from other software. So they've been  running food hubs where they've maybe had 60 or 80 different producers that they're  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:07):**  combining under one platform so that food eaters can go in there and order from a big  list of producers at once. It's been really positive. Tamar Valley Food Hubs have found  when they switched over, actually doubled the sales through their food hub because the  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:21):**  platform is much easier to use than what they were using before. Also, small producers that  have wanted to explore doing direct sales themselves and then finding that through the  Open Food Network, not only can they sell to their own customers, but then they can  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:33):**  access other food hubs or food distribution enterprises nearby. They can expand their  market without having to do that another uploading of products, managing the stock, blah, blah,  blah. It's all managed centrally in one place. And the beauty of the Open Food Network is  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:15:47):**  that we actually have the capacity to scale this right up. So we could have a small producer  who's selling to food hub and that food hub actually distributes to a few different community  groups locally, or we could join together different food hubs that want to import, say,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:02):**  maybe citrus from Spain. Maybe an individual food hub isn't big enough to warrant getting  a pallet every week, but a few food hubs together. Another side of that is the flexibility of  the platform. So we don't make any demands as to what your business model should be.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:17):**  Have food control, whether you are a farmer's market that wants to add 10%, or maybe you're  a buying group where everybody's volunteering their time so you don't add any markup. Or  maybe you're actually a retail shop and you need to add a 30% markup, but you also want  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:31):**  to be able to facilitate people buying online so you can do deliveries. You know, maybe  people come and pick up and then you charge no delivery fee. Maybe you have home delivery  and you charge a delivery fee for that. So all of the fee structures mean that you can  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:16:44):**  create a business model that really works for your community or your enterprise. You're  not locked into anything else. You know, there's some rise of platforms out there like Airbnb  and Uber, and in some ways they're really good. They provide a service. In other ways,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:01):**  they're really concentrating power so that the owners of that software come very wealthy  from everybody else using it. You know, that concentration of power, like everyone else  in our food system, is something that we don't want to see happen. So we're running it as  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:16):**  a platform cooperative. People who are users can make decisions on how it works, including,  you know, who gets paid what and what functionality we should be implementing next. Writing software  is a huge expense. If you want bespoke features, then you put a fork out quite a lot. What  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:31):**  we've done, we've recognised as the Open Food Network that actually these features are needed  by food producers and communities all over the world. And so the software is written  in a collaborative open source way, and we have groups in Australia, in Germany, in France,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:47):**  in Norway, in Sweden, in the States, in Canada, in South Africa, in Brazil, in India, you  know. Actually, there's people all over the world now who are contributing to the open  source community and helping to build new features. It's been specifically designed  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:17:59):**  for food. You know, there's a lot of e-commerce stuff out there, but a lot of it won't handle  some of the nuances when you're actually trying to sell food. So you know that you can do  maybe 10 bags of salad a week, or you know that in the freezer you've got, you know,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:13):**  four lambs left, and that's your stock levels. So you can limit that stock to what you actually  have. Say you're selling cheese or cuts of meat, but you want people to be able to order  in advance. Real classic problem that you don't, you know, you have different weights  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:29):**  and different cuts, and you can't actually predict in advance what they're going to be.  So the platform allows you to have that flexibility. You can say, around about this much, and then  charge actually a bit more or a bit less when you have the weights in. If you wanted to  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:42):**  do group buying, so supporting things like meat shares, if you know that you get to a  certain order and you can send so many of your animals off to slaughter, and then, but  if you get a bigger order, you can send even more, you can kind of set tiers of stock levels.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:18:58):**  So we try to really work with giving the flexibility to what works for producers, rather than demanding  that producers work to the consumer. As a small scale food producer, it is really hard  to make a living. We all know that. Finding extra money to try out online sales is not  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:15):**  really something that people want to find the budget for. So it is based on a pay what  you can model. You can try it out, see if it works for you, and what we're asking is  that if people do find that it adds value to their business, then think about if some  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:30):**  of that value could be contributed back to the platform so that other people can use  it as well. In the UK at the moment, we've actually been supported by Esme Furman to  launch and we have funding to support food producers that want to come on board, so we're  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:19:44):**  able to help people get started and provide the hand holding and things like that. So  now is a really good time to get in touch if you want to try it out. My name is Mark  Harrison. I'm a grower from Stratt Community Agriculture, which is a CSA based in Gloucestershire.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:02):**  We farm 50 acres in total, but we have 7 acres of vegetables, mixed and beef and pigs and  sheep. The bulk of the business is through the CSA, which means that we have a very regular  market that we supply, but we do have surpluses in the summer, so using the OFN we've really  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:22):**  been able to sell most of our surpluses then to the local community. The CSA bit is just  the veg, so again we can sell the meat through the open food network and it gives us a wider  market within the local community. It's just once a week. It takes us an hour maybe to  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:43):**  pack it up, because the project is all there anyway. It takes another hour to drive it  up and drop it off. That's all it takes is two hours. It's all done for us. The people  pre-ordered it. We know exactly what they want the day before. We can make it up. We  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:20:57):**  can deliver it the night before. It's just very efficient from our point of view. Give  it a go.  I is for the interest on our overdraft. J is for a jigsaw with which we go down. K is  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:12):**  for Clifton and fire. Okay, who remembers this? The wonderful voice of Ed Hamer. That's  right. Nigel, do you remember? Where did we hear him? We heard him at the Oxford Real  Farming Conference last year. It's nice to learn the back. That was from episode seven.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:33):**  Wow, do you really know that? Yeah, it's like six months since we started, because it's  been a long time. We've had him on the show before to talk about his policy work for the  Land Workers Alliance, and we've got him here again. This time he's got some tips for growing  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:21:47):**  courgettes in tyres and also raised green manure beds.  We're quite unique. Chag Feud Community Market Garden in the sense that we're farming at  650 feet above sea level in the southwest of England. That has a significant effect  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:02):**  on the growing conditions and the length of our growing season. One of the things we noticed  in the first two or three years we were growing was that we would plant the courgettes and  squash out in the beginning of May, and we'd quite consistently have a strong north-easterly  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:14):**  wind, cold wind, that would come and buffet the young seedlings. It would often burn the  leaves because it was a cold wind. We picked up a very useful tip from a friend, Martin  Godfrey, a local grower, of laying out tyres, old used tyres from garages, just out onto  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:34):**  mypex. That helps to prevent some of the leaching of the rubber into the soil. It creates a  windbreak around the plant, but importantly it also creates a microclimate. That tyre,  because it's black, it heats up in the sun and it creates a warm air pocket that the  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:22:51):**  seedling then grows up into. It's only ready when it's big enough that it's ready to put  its leaves over the top of the tyre. By that stage it's resilient to the wind that we have.  Usually by the beginning of June that wind has swung around to the southwest anyway.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:04):**  Also, it's worth pointing out that using this system, if you are going to get a late frost,  we sometimes get a frost in June. If that was the case and we were going to get a late  frost, having the tyres over the squash plants means we can pull a length of fleece over  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:16):**  the whole section of the cucurbits without damaging any of the plants because they're  all safely protected by their own individual tyre. For us and anyone growing on an exposed  site or anyone at high altitude, that system works incredibly well in terms of mitigating  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:34):**  the effects of a shortened season. Again, driven by the fact that we're on a marginal  growing site, we need to do everything we can to be able to get onto the ground earlier  in the spring in order to get the early crops, the potatoes and onions, into the ground and  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:23:48):**  get that ground cultivated. We've discovered almost by accident over the past three or  four years that if we ridge up the ground in any spare ground that we're going to put  a winter green manure on in the autumn, so in September, October, we ridge up that area  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:04):**  and then broadcast a green manure onto ridges. You can do it either using a potato plough,  we've done it with a horse-drawn implement. You're then overwintering on ridges and what  it means is that by the spring, those ridges actually drain the soil much better than you  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:18):**  would on the flat soil. It also means because the ground is ridged, it has a bigger surface  area, a larger surface area than flat ground and those ridges actually warm up a lot quicker  in the early spring sunshine. As a result, we think typically we're able to get on the  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:32):**  ground a couple of weeks earlier and we simply drive over those ridges with a disc harrow  and open them up and you're basically incorporating the green manure as you go but you've got  a really nice fluffy tilth inside those ridges that's dry, it's warm and it can be a matter  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:46):**  of two or three passes with the disc harrows over those overwintered ridges and then you've  got a good enough tilth to go straight in and put the potatoes. So we think by doing  that it's probably saved us a couple of weeks at the start of the season for the last couple  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:24:58):**  of years.  Now for another friend of the show, Ben Raskin of the Soil Association. He visited Plotgate  CSA, part of the CSA network. The voices you hear, other than Ben's, belong to Amy, Dan  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:31):**  and Jane at Plotgate.  So tell us what's going on here.  We're about a year old. We set the CSR say up last spring. We are growing vegetables  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:41):**  in a field in Somerset.  We had a walk around this morning and one of the things that struck me was the way you've  designed the growing system. So you've got raised beds but also running on contours.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:25:55):**  So talk me through the process of that decision process.  One of the ideas is to try and minimise mechanisation. So we're trying to work out a way to grow  without tractors and we're trying to retain as much of the moisture, the rainfall and  
**[0:26:11-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:11):**  the fertility to try and work towards what we think is a truly sustainable food system  that is both low input and accessible to most people to be able to participate in the process  of growing with the mind to create a community driven food system as opposed to an industrial  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:39):**  food system.  And at the moment you're growing on about an acre and a half, is that right?  About an acre and a half.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah.  And you're  About two and a half.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah. So how are you getting from pasture to raised bed without mechanisation?  Firstly we've got some pigs. They're very sweet little creatures that are digging over  the pasture, rooting out all the perennial weeds, particularly the dandelions which is  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:07):**  one of our biggest problems and the thistles. They're on there for about a year and we  will then move them onto another patch which we'll be doing next year and that leaves the  ground really nice and clean for then sculpting the raised beds of which we're developing  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:25):**  hand powered tools which facilitate the process of moving the soil.  Yeah, so all the beds are four foot wide and five foot centre to centre on the paths either  side so the tool that we're developing is basically a two person push tool that allows  
**[0:27:43-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:27:43):**  you to cultivate and to use different tooling attachments in order to run up and down the  beds as two people pushing in an upright position which obviously is much better in terms of  the ergonomics of growing than bending over a hoe and allows you to make the most of those  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:04):**  kind of weather windows when the conditions are right for hoeing and to get round a lot  more of the garden much more quickly.  So what drove you to set up as a CSA rather than a commercial, more traditional vegetable  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:21):**  growing operation?  Well I've certainly come to horticulture through a CSA and just really, really loved the way  that CSAs try to connect people with the places where their food's grown, with how their food's  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:37):**  grown, the opportunities that it offers people to understand more about that process, to  be involved with that process without having to take on the full responsibility of growing  stuff for themselves.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:28:49):**  It's more fun doing it with other people, I can't imagine that I would want to grow  if I was by myself in a field and also it's about education, it's about trying to engage  people with the food debate, so yeah for us a CSA was the obvious choice and it's also  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:07):**  about short supply chains and being able to sell direct to people, yeah it's been really  important.  And it's about building resilience as well, if you have just the right level of connection  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:19):**  between various things within a system then that builds the local resilience and ultimately  the resilience of the food system from an economic, ecological and the social aspects,  these are all very important to build up this day and age if I may put it that way and this  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:36):**  model seemed to me from having observed various others, this one was a shining example of  resilience in action, so it's the sort of thing that makes you very much want to be  part of that and I hope that other people will also want to be part of that and come  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:29:51):**  and join in in some way locally and that's really what we're all about is encouraging  that participation in the process of doing our shares of veg every week in the pub and  by delivery.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:05):**  Thank you for that Ben, the Plotgate visit was part of the CSA Network Mentoring Programme  which is a really great scheme offered by the CSA Network in the UK and they still have  funding left for more mentoring days in England so do get in touch.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:20):**  And we also wanted to let you know that Ben has two new books out, the first is the Community  Gardening Handbook which does pretty much what it says on the tin and he's got another  one for helping to inspire a younger generation which is called Grow and it's a family guide  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:36):**  to growing fruits.  And Nigel can you fill us in on the BOOM Awards?  The BOOM Awards is the best of organic market awards and it's a really great opportunity  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:30:50):**  for you to go out and nominate your favourite organic farmer, producer or rising star so  you've basically got until the end of the month to go onto the website and nominate  someone.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:31:03):**  And Nigel you're really hiding under a bushel there which is not like you.  Oh yeah and so I've been asked to judge the awards as well so yeah I'm really looking  forward to judging the awards sometime early May and I think there's an award ceremony  
**[0:31:20-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:31:20):**  in July as well so hopefully see some of you there.  Okay so before we go we've got a little bit of an announcement, Farmarama is now advert  free.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:31:38):**  Woohoo!  Womp womp!  Because we take the feedback that it's been a little bit annoying.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:31:46):**  You don't need to change anything if you listen to the show on our website or if you download  it through iTunes or actually wherever you download it.  For the technical listener out there who will understand the RSS feed it's not going to  
**[0:32:00-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:32:00):**  change but you can now find us on Soundcloud.  We look forward to sharing more stories from the smaller scale farming community next month.  So goodbye from me.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:32:19):**  Toodle-oo.  Goodbye from me.  And Nigel are you going to promise to come back and join us again next month?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:32:25):**  I'll definitely be back next month for sure, Joe.  We'll hold you to that.  Thank you.  
**[0:32:30-0:33:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20#t=0:32:30):**  Thanks.

## 53: Storytelling, Nutrient Density, Fashion and Community Farms  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:04):**  This month we bring you the first of three special episodes focusing for the most part  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:14):**  on stories from the Oxford Real Farming Conference or ORFC which took place in January.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:20):**  This year we were delighted to be the ORFC's official media partner.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:25):**  So fresh from the conference we hear about the role of myth making and storytelling in  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:30):**  building the regenerative farming movement and we learn about a new initiative to put  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:35):**  nutrient density at the heart of good food and farming.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:40):**  Then we hear from a young fashion designer about her innovative accessory collections  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:45):**  reawakening our connections between fashion and farming.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:50):**  And we have an urgent call for councils across the UK to recognise the value of real farming.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:00:57):**  In a few days time, Trekkadugan Farm in Pembrokeshire will be put up for auction and we'll be hearing  
**[0:01:02-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:02):**  from Gerald Miles about efforts to protect it as a community resource.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:15):**  As part of this year's ORFC, writer and storyteller Georgia Wingfield-Hayes shared a piece called  
**[0:01:21-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:21):**  The Herdsman.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:23):**  It tells the true story of Charles Ellett.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:25):**  He's now a happy herdsman at the ethical dairy but he previously worked at an intensive dairy  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:31):**  farm with 1500 cows where his mental health crashed.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:36):**  Through Charles' story we learn what cheap food is doing to the land, the animals and  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:41):**  the people involved in its production.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:45):**  We'll be releasing the full story as a short.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:47):**  First though, let's hear from Georgia about why storytelling and myth making are crucial  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:52):**  to the regenerative farming movement and why they're so central to what ORFC is all about.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:01:59):**  We can tell the big picture story which we can't do with fact.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:08):**  Fact we have to zone in on specifics.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:12):**  And then there's the depth.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:13):**  So if we're disseminating facts we're rarely really touching any emotional notes or you  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:18):**  know the deeper sense senses of who we are as humans whereas with story we can really  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:25):**  speak to those deeper parts.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:27):**  We have responses in our heart, in our emotion, in our gut.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:32):**  And I think that's incredibly powerful and it's why storytelling has been the means of  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:38):**  disseminating information through the entirety of human history.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:44):**  We've sat around fires and told stories.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:46):**  So it's now like a foreign language that we have to relearn because at conferences like  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:51):**  this we get lots of people standing up and disseminating facts which is wonderful because  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:55):**  we learn loads.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:02:59):**  But storytelling it's broader and deeper because the storytelling that's used to sell neocatalyst  
**[0:03:07-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:07):**  ideas and what we might call old wives tales and you know things that you shouldn't go  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:17):**  to bed with wet hair because you'll get pneumonia or do you know what I mean like silly stories  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:22):**  like that that we've believed potentially as a culture and science has disproved.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:30):**  With that we've thrown the baby out with the bathwater in that we've thrown away this  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:38):**  much deeper relationship through our senses with the world.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:46):**  We're living in this post-truth age where we've no idea actually when we go on the internet  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:51):**  whether we're reading fact or fiction.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:03:55):**  It's becoming more and more difficult and this you know this is a nightmare but it's  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:01):**  actually potentially very exciting because I think it might help cultivate an age where  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:08):**  people are like well actually the only way I really know what's true is if I come back  
**[0:04:11-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:11):**  if I reclaim my autonomy over my senses and over how I interact with the world that there's  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:23):**  a deeper inner knowing.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:26):**  If we again if we can learn that language that then we can override all of the of everything  
**[0:04:34-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:34):**  that we're being fed you know we were so conditioned to give autonomy to fact to external authority  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:44):**  but a society that does that is infantilizing its people.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:52):**  I would say that the kind of crux of it all is trust.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:04:57):**  It's very very challenging for us to trust ourselves and our inner knowing because everything  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:04):**  in our culture tells us we shouldn't.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:07):**  And so don't beat yourself up.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:11):**  It's a journey but experiment with trusting.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:15):**  Experiment when you have the opportunity when it's like your head says something and your  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:18):**  heart says something else and it's safe to trust your heart.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:22):**  Trust your heart and see what happens because it's like that is the way that we step by  
**[0:05:28-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:28):**  step bring that autonomy back within ourselves and find our way to a much deeper sense of  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:39):**  who we are which is so much more exciting than the way that culture has us living.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:47):**  People at a conference like this really are other people at the forefront of understanding  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:05:58):**  that and rekindling that and rebirthing it if you like.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:04):**  And it's so important this is so vital this deeper relationship with with the earth with  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:10):**  other beings cultivating humility to realize that we don't have all the answers we can't  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:16):**  possibly have all the answers living systems are incredibly complex.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:22):**  Science can't understand the totality of that complexity and therefore we have to find other  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:29):**  ways to approach these systems.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:34):**  We are we are these amazing complex sensory beings who can can read the world on on many  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:42):**  different levels if we if we allow ourselves to and if we if we allow ourselves to relearn  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:49):**  that language.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:50):**  So for me storytelling a myth really that's where I really get excited about it because  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:06:56):**  we get down and dirty if you like with who we are who we actually are and who we have  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:02):**  the potential to become which is which is a far greater more exciting being than neo  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:08):**  capitalism would have us believe we are.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:13):**  I'm a big advocate of beauty as a key part of a positive farming future.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:19):**  Beauty in the deepest sense of the word.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:22):**  The Greek root of the word beauty is related to the word for calling.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:26):**  So beauty in this in this case being something that moves you and calls you into being alive.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:34):**  When you listen to Charles's story it really brings to life the value of beauty on a farm.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:39):**  Without it farms may house living creatures but they have no vitality.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:47):**  Matt Adams is a deep ecologist and Elizabeth Westaway is a public health and nutrition  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:51):**  specialist.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:52):**  They recently launched an initiative called Growing Real Food for Nutrition or GRIFFIN  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:58):**  for short.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:07:59):**  GRIFFIN promotes the importance of growing eating and measuring the quality of nutrient  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:04):**  dense food.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:05):**  Matt and Elizabeth are officially bringing to the UK the work of Dan Kittredge and the  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:10):**  Bionutrient Food Association who are helping to develop a Bionutrient Meter.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:16):**  At ORFC they invited growers to bring in their vegetables and do a BRICS test to get a crude  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:22):**  idea of nutrient density in their crops.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:25):**  We are right at the beginning stages, we need support and we need to find funding to make  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:30):**  it happen.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:31):**  So the intention behind it is to ask the question what is nutrition because I think it's a deep  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:37):**  deep question and for me as a deep ecologist I'm interested in the world view, a world  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:43):**  view that suggests that actually we're a part of nature but we are living in a world that's  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:47):**  dominated by the view where we try and control nature.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:51):**  So I am interested in promoting anything that can question our current world view, so we're  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:08:59):**  questioning this assumption.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:00):**  So control it seems to me is leading to a decline in the nutritional quality of our  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:05):**  food which is affecting both the health of the planet and human health as well and we  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:10):**  can feel and see that all around.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:12):**  So growing food for nutrition is about thinking of a different way of our relationship with  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:18):**  the world and with nature and that we are realizing we are a part of nature.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:23):**  So when you begin measuring food for its nutrient quality you begin to think about what's going  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:28):**  on, you begin to ask that deeper question of what is nutrition and with the BRICS test  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:33):**  it's such a simple simple test that you can, everybody can just squash an apple and with  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:39):**  a few drops look into a refractometer and find out roughly whether that's a poorly grown  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:45):**  apple or a really excellent grown apple.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:48):**  And from field observation which is growers in the field actually watching what happens  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:54):**  in these situations, if you've got a carrot for example that's in the excellent category  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:09:59):**  it not only tastes really really brilliant, you get an increased yield, it grows really  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:05):**  well and there's even this claim that there's an absence of pest and disease and the plant  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:12):**  is able, what's happening is that plant is able to communicate with the life in the soil  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:17):**  and it's feeding that life in the soil with these exudates, the carbohydrate that it produces,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:23):**  it gives up to half of that down to the exudates down to feed the soil microbes.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:29):**  And in return the microbes are increasing in number so as an organic life form they  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:36):**  are sequestering carbon in order to grow in population in number and with an abundance  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:42):**  of microbes in the ground they're the ones sourcing all the mineral elements that the  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:46):**  plant requires and there's communication going on there so it's a fabulous story.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:52):**  So the plant is saying to the microbes look you guys wake up and here's some food to help  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:10:56):**  wake you up, I need a little bit more selenium or molybdenum or some phosphorus and these  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:03):**  microbes are working in harmony with the plants to do that, it's a beautiful symbiotic relationship  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:08):**  and when we allow the plant and the microbes to work together what the result of that is  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:14):**  is nutrient dense food, it's a plant that's well grown and so the BRICS test is a way  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:20):**  of assessing that, it's a crude assessment measuring carbohydrate which relates to photosynthesis  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:27):**  and then moving that on to take it to the next level is the development of the bio-nutrient  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:32):**  meter so it's a scanner that uses spectroscopy that means light reflectance and in order  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:39):**  to calibrate this tool we need to do the laboratory analysis to find out what the nutrients are  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:46):**  for example in a carrot and then relate that to the reflected signal we get back from the  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:53):**  scanner so that when you build out a database with lots and lots of samples you begin to  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:11:59):**  expose the nutrient density of the food that we're growing and that is revealing already  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:08):**  some interesting results where spinach for example has got 14 times more iron in the  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:15):**  best grown samples than the worst grown samples and that's significant and in carrots they  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:22):**  found 200 times more polyphenols than the worst grown carrot and polyphenols as you  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:30):**  probably know relate to secondary nutrients and secondary nutrients I think is the big  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:35):**  buzz story that's going to come up for nutrition because it relates to the plant's ability  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:41):**  to look after itself in an outdoor setting and so it's this communication constantly  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:48):**  with the microbes on an hourly, two hourly basis whatever asking for certain chemistries  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:12:56):**  for certain minerals to build it compounds and as we're now knowing what the compounds  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:02):**  the secondary metabolites there are thousands of them just in one carrot alone so it represents  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:10):**  you know an amazing chemical laboratory that's stimulated by life there's two things together  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:17):**  so measuring nutrient density and developing the scanner which would make it easy to do  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:22):**  that will expose the information of what's going on in our food but it'll also become  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:28):**  like a quality standard you can set the bar and say well if we can produce food of this  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:34):**  quality then we know that in order to do that you have to look after the soil and so we're  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:41):**  making healthy soil and also we know that that food is going to make us healthy because  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:46):**  it's now packed full of nutrients grown by nature and I think the real big as I said  
**[0:13:52-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:13:52):**  the real big thing around secondary nutrients is this range and diversity of secondary metabolites  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:01):**  where I think the key is going to come so we could get potential cheating to show that  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:08):**  hey we've got loads of sugar in this tomato and but we can also then ask the question  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:15):**  with the meter do we have lots of secondary nutrients as well because you can grow your  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:21):**  tomato in a hydroponic environment and it won't it won't need to fend for itself it's  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:29):**  mollycoddled so it's not going to produce all these secondary nutrients so hopefully  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:34):**  the scanner will begin to pick up on these subtle nuances that make all the difference  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:39):**  and and also the the ultimate test will then be to taste it and decide for yourself is  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:47):**  this good or not and there's an irony here I'm going to shoot myself in the foot we don't  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:51):**  need a scanner because we should have the innate ability to taste that food for ourselves  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:14:56):**  and understand whether it's good or not but we've lost that ability so the benefit I feel  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:04):**  the benefit of the small farmer is that here is a way of testing the quality of food that  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:11):**  would create the level playing field and it's not about certification it's about setting  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:18):**  a quality standard it's about setting a bar and saying this is the quality we'd like and  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:23):**  if you can produce that then we'd like to pay you respectively for that and I have this  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:28):**  little vision now of the future where when the grower is elevated in society and respected  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:35):**  then I know that we'll have we'll have hit a nutrient dense regenerative state there's  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:41):**  been a hundred bio nutrient meters made they've been you know handmade and I have I believe  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:48):**  the one and only bio nutrient meter in the UK so that's why we want to do something good  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:15:55):**  with it and our intention we need to find a laboratory which we are in negotiation with  
**[0:16:01-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:01):**  that can do the testing and yeah let's go from there.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:11):**  We've been wanting to share the work of fashion designer Alice Robinson for a few months.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:15):**  Her pieces beautifully bring farming into the limelight.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:19):**  Alice grew up in a rural community and so went back to her roots to create two collections  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:24):**  each made solely from one animal using all parts of the animal for the collection not  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:30):**  a scrap wasted.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:32):**  Alice told us all about it.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:37):**  I was faced with a challenge when I was doing my masters at the Royal College of Art to  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:42):**  create a collection and leather was sort of thrust upon me as if this was the material  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:47):**  in which you made pieces with which from that point of view I could understand because leather  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:53):**  is an incredible material to withstand many conditions and last a really long time it's  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:16:59):**  incredibly durable and great natural material to work with.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:02):**  However being a part of the conversation of what we're choosing to what systems we're  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:08):**  choosing to be a part of food wise I then found that quite difficult to understand what  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:12):**  this material I was being given and where this had came from and what food system it  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:16):**  had been a part of.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:18):**  For me I was brought up in Shropshire as part of a very farming family.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:23):**  My father was a vet and was brought up in that rural system of understanding my farmer,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:30):**  the butchers, the systems in which the animals being bred and the husbandry.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:37):**  My father was a large animal vet so that was sort of something I just always been aware  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:44):**  of and respectful of.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:45):**  I've now created two collections both of which are the tag numbers of those animals.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:50):**  So I have 11458 which is a sheep, New Zealand Texel ram crushed with a Welsh mule and Bullock  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:17:56):**  374 which is a Longhorn limousine cross.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:00):**  Both are from my home county and farmers which I have known and visited and understand their  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:11):**  practices.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:12):**  The sheep collection I created 11458 I spun the wool and tanned the hide and so the whole  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:23):**  collection sits within one box.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:25):**  So the size of that box is indicative of the animal which has created the collection.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:32):**  So there is a jumper, a pair of gloves, a bag, a pair of shoes, a little card wallet,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:37):**  all of the hardware, other bones sort of dipped in silver and engraved and then a perfume  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:45):**  which is based on the trees and plants and time of year in which the animal came from  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:49):**  that field.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:51):**  As a designer only working with what I've been left with, basically trying to have design  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:18:56):**  which is mindful and not wasteful working with what is there rather than creating more  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:01):**  problems.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:02):**  I then served 350 burgers of sheep 11458 at the launch of the collection.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:08):**  So for me it was sort of trying to then have that connection back, have that conversation  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:15):**  that there is, it's not too far apart from what you're holding to what you're putting  
**[0:19:19-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:19):**  in your mouth and that the fashion industry has a huge role to play in educating people  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:28):**  and to widening the conversation from not just going oh this isn't an animal product  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:34):**  therefore it's eco because it's not come from a food industry.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:40):**  So following on from that collection we're curating an exhibition called Food Bigger  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:43):**  Than the Plate which was on at the Victoria and Albert Museum and they asked if they could  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:47):**  exhibit it but I had already been speaking to my local farmer who's a guy called Malcolm  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:52):**  Adams and has the most beautiful farm called Charity Farm.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:19:56):**  And so the connection to working with that farmer and that land and that community was  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:03):**  something that was really important to me.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:07):**  I then took Bullock 374 through the entire process, went to the abattoir, took the hideaway,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:14):**  tanned the hide, both hair on and hair off and then had the split.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:19):**  So the split is when you slice through the thickness of leather and that drop you then  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:23):**  buff up and that's why you have suede.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:25):**  So it was important for me to be able to have the hair on in this collection which really  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:30):**  showed what breed the animal was.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:33):**  So long horned limousine cross meant he was like brindled and it was incredibly beautiful  
**[0:20:39-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:39):**  and also really emotive which I think is also key to creating the work is that the preciousness  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:50):**  of these items and this throwaway culture if you're able to sort of engage someone that  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:20:56):**  isn't just the spring, summer 16 that there is something that to be cherished.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:05):**  I then used the horns of Bullock 374 to make the buttons and the bones to make buttons  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:12):**  and the closures and then worked with a perfume maker in Cornwall to create a perfume which  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:19):**  was based on the field in which Bullock 374 came from.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:23):**  I through working this way had the opportunity to know which tannery I was working with to  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:28):**  understand how the water filtration systems worked, where was every single element of  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:33):**  waste from this one animal going and documenting it throughout because as a designer as well  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:39):**  it's a huge lesson to learn and you know you can then make certain design choices or  
**[0:21:47-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:47):**  just system choices that you know it's so useful to be able to design out problems.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:21:57):**  There's a statistic that two thirds of a hide is wasted in the production of one accessory  
**[0:22:02-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:02):**  because leather is an animal byproduct so there are bits that are stretchy or the tummy  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:12):**  is you know not the best place to cut from but it's all relevant for different items  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:17):**  so for me I was I decided that I would design and make the entire collection at the same  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:21):**  time so that I could problem solve and repurpose all of these this design to fit the purpose  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:29):**  of each item.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:31):**  So everything is designed as long and as wide and and specifically to fit fit the hide that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:42):**  then means that when the collection all sits together it has this image of exactly what  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:47):**  has gone into creating this item.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:52):**  I then spent nine and a half hours with a butcher which was such an experience who knew  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:22:57):**  it took nine and a half hours to butcher an entire bullock.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:02):**  Well it does and it's really cold and it was great it was such an informative day.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:10):**  I worked with my local butcher who was absolutely brilliant I had spreadsheets and and all this  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:21):**  labeling to make sure that every cut I chose to make was for a different purpose so I sold  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:26):**  the meat locally to like the local community as much as how Malcolm Adams the farmer would  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:32):**  have.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:34):**  I then also did dinners that were sort of centered around the whole conversation of  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:43):**  of the project so for the closing of the exhibition at the Victoria Albert Museum I did a dinner  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:49):**  for 70 people and it was three courses of Bullock 374.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:54):**  I had the leather collection present and it was just really trying to bring back this  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:23:59):**  connection between food and what we're wearing and how the two industries have just this  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:07):**  huge overlap.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:09):**  I then also got to do the same style of dinner but up north with the guys from the abattoir  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:15):**  and the butcher and the local farmer and our community and we had big chuck pies and pints  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:23):**  and it was just brilliant but it was just amazing how far apart those two sort of worlds  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:27):**  were so yeah that was that was really great.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:32):**  There's a growing Fibre Shed movement here in the UK linking farmers, processors and  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:37):**  fashion designers.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:39):**  We're helping to get Fibre Shed UK started so if you're interested in being involved

**[0:24:49-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:49):**  and we'll be keeping you in the loop.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:24:58):**  Finally we wanted to share the story of Trega Dugan Farm in Pembrokeshire, South West Wales.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:05):**  Its history goes back to the 11th century and it's been a council farm for nearly a  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:09):**  hundred years.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:10):**  Now though the council has decided to sell it off.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:14):**  A group from the local community including farmer Gerald Miles is fighting to buy Trega  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:19):**  Dugan and turn it into a community farm but their attempts have so far been thwarted despite  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:25):**  the fact that they've met all of the council's demands.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:29):**  The council says it's following due process and it's announced that the farm will be put  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:33):**  back up for auction on the 4th of March.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:38):**  Sam Ruddock is one of the backers of the Save Trega Dugan Farm campaign.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:43):**  She told us the community are appealing to other potential buyers to step back and allow  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:49):**  the community to fulfill the dreams for themselves and all who live there.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:53):**  Sam also highlighted that this is part of a larger concern as more and more county farms  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:25:58):**  come up for sale.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:00):**  As she put it, how can we repurpose them and get them to be part of the movement for social  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:06):**  justice, food justice and land justice in the UK.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:11):**  Here's Gerald to tell us more about the fight for Trega Dugan Farm.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:18):**  We have over 40 council farms being sold all over Wales and the one locally to us which  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:25):**  is near the village of Soliver is now going to be sold.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:31):**  It was my cousin's husband's farm and he farmed it all his life over 60 years.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:41):**  The council are selling this off to get more money to invest into the social care and what  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:48):**  they actually are responsible for.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:52):**  These farms are more than an asset in monetary terms.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:26:58):**  It's the opportunity for young people to start farming.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:02):**  These were bought after the First World War as an opportunity for young people that came  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:08):**  from the war to start farming and this is what it should be kept at.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:14):**  At the moment now with the council selling it, they're denying us the opportunity of  
**[0:27:22-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:22):**  turning it into a community farm which would be a place for the community to enjoy it,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:31):**  to be rewarded in being there, in learning how to grow vegetables.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:37):**  It can be such a gem to the well-being of the community and it would empower the community  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:46):**  because it would be their farm, a place they could care for, it could be shared in so many  
**[0:27:52-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:27:52):**  ways, creating small enterprises like making cheese, preserves, having a small butchery  
**[0:28:03-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:03):**  there, different crafts, having children there to see how vegetables are grown, employing  
**[0:28:11-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:11):**  young people on the place and making it a vibrant local enterprise involving the people  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:20):**  and the farm together.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:23):**  The point is it's a community farm, it's our farm anyway.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:28):**  The council should by right give it to us because we're going to do a job they should  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:35):**  be doing.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:36):**  When we approached the council about this in the first place, we invited them to be  
**[0:28:42-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:42):**  part of it but at the present we're getting no support from the council.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:51):**  In the first place they thought we were dreaming in our approach of creating a community farm  
**[0:28:59-0:29:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:28:59):**  that would benefit the community and benefiting young people and elderly people and children  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:06):**  in the area.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:08):**  They thought we were imagining all this, they wanted us to give a 50,000 deposit within  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:16):**  seven days.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:18):**  They put that as a challenge to us but we raised it and when we brought the money to  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:24):**  the council office they didn't know what to do, they said we don't need it.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:32):**  Then they took it off auction but still had bids in.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:37):**  We had a funder to support us and we were the highest bidder and we bought it.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:43):**  The funder at the time withdrew because the council wanted to put place an overage on  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:51):**  the farm.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:29:52):**  An overage is a legislation, a sort of tax, whatever you invest into this and improve  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:01):**  the buildings on this farm.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:04):**  It ranges over 25 years.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:08):**  The increase in value, we will have to pay 30% of that increase of value to the council.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:16):**  At that time we bought it we were disputing this.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:19):**  They wouldn't manoeuvre at all or be helpful about this so our funders pulled out of it.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:27):**  Then we sent an email to the council requesting a meeting.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:32):**  The next email we had in return, the council stated that it's going back on auction and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:39):**  if we wanted to place a bid in we had four days to do it.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:44):**  We did that and we managed to actually accomplish to win the bid on the second round and we  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:52):**  had a funder to cover this.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:30:56):**  At this moment in time now we are faced with a decision because the council have just told  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:02):**  us that they're guzzompting us.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:05):**  They've got another higher bidder to come in for the farm because of a report in the  
**[0:31:12-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:12):**  local paper that stated the price that was paid for the farm.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:20):**  But that report was of the previous, the first time bidding round.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:27):**  So this is what we're faced with.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:30):**  We're faced with a council that are employed by us.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:35):**  They're supposed to work for us and help us.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:40):**  Their role should be to help us create a community farm.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:46):**  Not to really try to manipulate to get the best price out of it.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:52):**  This is a lovely farm.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:54):**  It was built back in the 14th century.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:31:57):**  Two families lived there and farmed there.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:01):**  Instead it's going to be sold as an asset and it's going to be turned into another holiday  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:07):**  complex.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:09):**  People will stay there and not really care for the buildings, for what they are and what  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:15):**  they were meant to be.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:17):**  They've taken 70 acres away from the farm so it isn't holding as it was anymore.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:23):**  They've rented that to another bigger farm.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:27):**  They've left this holding farm with only 11 acres.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:31):**  It's left to be developed and turned into a sort of housing holiday complex.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:40):**  We're in the situation now where we're going to get as much media coverage to get media  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:47):**  pressure as well.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:49):**  We're going to try to get political support from the Welsh Assembly because it's more  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:57):**  than our local farm.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:32:59):**  It's all council farms in Wales.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:02):**  It's all council farms all over the UK.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:06):**  And if you're talking about climate change and you're concerned about food security and  
**[0:33:12-0:33:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:12):**  you're concerned about community, it's common sense that we should invest in the community.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:23):**  There was a young friend of mine who I was talking to last night and their farm where  
**[0:33:30-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:30):**  he's working is for sale and his nine-year-old son works with him growing the vegetables.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:39):**  They were talking about this and the son had heard them and this nine-year-old boy said,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:46):**  what right have we got to own the soil when we're living here?  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:52):**  We don't cherish it.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:33:55):**  It's an asset instead of without it we won't have food.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms#t=0:34:07):**  Farmarama is made by Jo Barrett, Abby Rose and me, Katie Revel.

### Farmerama  (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 18:45:43)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama. After last month's words from farmers around the world,  
**[0:00:15-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:15):**  we are now back on British soil. We have stories from Perthshire to Devon and we stop off in  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:22):**  a few places in between. A few of us headed to the first Scottish farm hack to share and  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:27):**  learn from many other farmers, smallholders and food makers. We'll be sharing the highlights  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:32):**  later in the show. We also catch up with Patrick Holden from the Sustainable Food Trust about  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:38):**  fair trade, transparent pricing and how he makes the most of the byproducts from his  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:43):**  dairy farm. We have a great little trick for soil testing on the cheap, a great British  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:47):**  test, the TBI, any guesses what it stands for? And then we are in Shropshire to find  
**[0:00:53-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:00:53):**  out about some of the ups and downs of woofing.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:06):**  You may remember Patrick Holden as a guest on this show. He's the man behind the Sustainable  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:11):**  Food Trust. He's also a farmer and has been making cheese for 43 years on one of the first  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:16):**  certified organic dairy farms in Wales. He recently chatted to us about the importance  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:21):**  of farmers receiving a fair price that reflects the cost of production. But first he shares  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:27):**  a story of how a conversation with a neighbour led to a new outlet for one of his waste products.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:32):**  Well I had a conversation at the Slow Food Terra Madre youth event in Milan with a man  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:39):**  who actually lives down the road from me but who I'd never met last year. He's called  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:46):**  Ilted or Ilted as people who are not Welsh speakers tend to call him. And his wife Liesel,  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:01:53):**  they set up a charcuterie business near Carmarthen and he happened to know that I was a dairy  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:02):**  farmer and obviously because of that we were producing a lot of calves. And he said what  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:09):**  do you do with your male calves? And I had to be honest and I told him, I said well sometimes  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:15):**  we literally slaughter them at birth because there's no market for them otherwise we just  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:20):**  sold them off to whoever would take them at a reasonable price. And he said to me well  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:27):**  I'd like to buy your calves. And I said to him how much will you pay? Because I knew  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:32):**  straight away that if he was paying a price below the cost of keeping them then there  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:39):**  would be no advantage to us and we were already losing money on our farm. So he said, and  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:44):**  this is what really shocked me, he said I will pay you the cost of production plus a  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:48):**  margin. And I said okay then. And that was 15 months or so ago. Now as we speak we are  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:02:57):**  selling one veal calf, whey fed and of course silage fed, rose veal really, per month to  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:04):**  Ilthid and he is processing them into a whole range of meats including steaks which are  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:14):**  absolutely delicious but also wonderful charcuterie products including a veal pork sausage type  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:21):**  product which is really delicious. The story of a dairy farm is the story of male calves.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:27):**  Unless you are using sexed semen, 50% of your dairy calves will be male. And really part  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:35):**  of the story of the farm ought to be to find a market for those calves where the meat will  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:40):**  be appreciated. And for me that's the very special thing. And this meat is already finding  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:46):**  its way into some fancy places like Fortnum and Mason's. That sounds very high end but  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:52):**  actually I think in the long run the meat ought to be sold in Wales by appreciative  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:03:58):**  citizens who want to be connected with a good story of sustainable dairy farming. And I  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:04):**  believe that this idea of transparent food pricing is a big idea and transferable. I  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:12):**  can't see why that could not be the basis of all future food pricing. So if when you  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:18):**  buy a product, whatever it is, you knew how much of the percentage of the price that you  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:24):**  were paying for the product went to the farmer, that's the essence of transparency. And it  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:30):**  would really transform the marketplace and re-empower both farmers and citizens to establish  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:38):**  a better and more equitable relationship with their food. I had a conversation, some might  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:44):**  call it an argument, with the fair trade movement back in the 90s when I was at the Soil Association  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:52):**  and some of our licensees including Greenland Blacks Chocolate and other licensees came  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:04:55):**  to us and said we're being certified by you the Soil Association and also the Fair Trade  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:00):**  Foundation. And it strikes us that there's no sense in that. Surely fair trade, in other  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:06):**  words the farmer getting a fair price ought to be part of the organic story. So why don't  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:10):**  you launch a fair trade and organic label combined in one with one inspection? So we  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:16):**  went to the Fair Trade Foundation and we said what about this is a good idea and they said  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:20):**  to us no, fair trade is about tea, coffee and bananas from peasant farmers in developing  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:27):**  countries. It's not about feather bedded European country farmers because they are cap subsidised  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:34):**  and actually very well off, thank you very much. So I said I don't think, first of all  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:38):**  I don't think that's right and secondly surely to coin a phrase, fair trade should start  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:43):**  at home. But the Fair Trade Foundation at that time were adamant that this wasn't something  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:51):**  they wanted to pursue. So we were left at the Soil Association in a dilemma and really  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:05:57):**  there was a split of opinion. I thought we should have taken the Fair Trade Foundation  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:01):**  on and said no you're wrong. But other people whose counsel prevailed in the end said no  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:06):**  it would be political and it would be a bit messy and best not to do that. So there we  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:11):**  are 20 years later maybe fair trade, the principle of fair trade is coming round again and it's  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:19):**  people, young entrepreneurs like Efted who are developing that.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:28):**  Thanks Patrick. He covered two things that are constant questions on Farmerama. What  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:32):**  does a future where farmers get paid a fair price for their produce look like? What waste  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:38):**  products from your farm are useful products for someone else?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:41):**  I think in particular that first question is something that, well we talked a little  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:47):**  bit further with Patrick about it and it really is an unknown, it's like what does a world  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:53):**  where farmers actually get paid, you know the cost of production and then some for what  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:06:58):**  they're making, how does that happen?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:02):**  It's like such a huge unravelling that needs to happen first, it's kind of very hard to  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:09):**  sort of see where you start that process and how you can make little steps towards it because  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:17):**  there needs to be such a huge sea change for us to get to a better place.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:22):**  I think that is the key isn't it, we need to start thinking about what are those little  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:25):**  steps and then the other thing we talked about was that being true at the other end of the  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:32):**  system so consumers really understanding what the farmer was taking away from what they  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:39):**  were paying for food and how much of an impact that would have on the whole system as well.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:49):**  We featured a few things about soil science over the last few months and we understand  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:53):**  the importance of knowing what is going on in the hidden depths beneath our feet.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:07:59):**  Today we're going to share an idea which is most definitely low tech and also making use  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:05):**  of a waste product, this time a tea bag.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:08):**  Here's Abby with Tom who she met whilst part of the field of wheat project.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:13):**  I'm Tom Powell, I work mostly on the global environmental implications of food systems  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:19):**  and land use. As part of field of wheat I ended up doing some much more local and specific  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:24):**  research on the variability of soil across an individual field and its implications for  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:30):**  the growth of crop plants.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:32):**  Being part of an artistic project we had absolutely no budget so I've had to find very cheap methods  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:38):**  of doing soil science which has been a really interesting process in itself.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:43):**  One technique I particularly like that I found in the methods section of a paper in Nature  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:49):**  where it was referred to mysteriously as the TBI and I had to dig into the references to  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:56):**  find out what that actually meant.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:08:59):**  The TBI is a method for measuring rates of soil decomposition of organic matter in the  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:05):**  soil. It stands for the tea bag index.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:10):**  It's developed by a Dutch research group who use Lipton's tea bags and they bury one Roybosh  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:16):**  tea bag and one green tea bag next to one another, leave them for 90 days and when you  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:22):**  dig them up the differential rate with which they've decomposed tells you about not only  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:27):**  how quickly organic matter decomposes in the soil but also how much of that, the carbon  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:33):**  within that organic matter ends up being respired back to the atmosphere and how much ends up  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:39):**  being stored in organic matter in the soil.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:41):**  So it's actually an incredibly neat tool for doing quite complex science but a very very  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:46):**  cheap and very available and they're trying to use it as a citizen science project to  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:50):**  calibrate global earth system models and climate models to get worldwide soil respiration data  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:09:57):**  so they have a very good website which you can find by googling tea bag index where they  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:02):**  have all of the methodology and the equation that you have to put your tea bag weights  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:06):**  into to get results and you can share your results with them.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:10):**  Amazing and if you want to learn more about Field of Weeds we first featured them in episode  
**[0:10:15-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:15):**  six there will be definitely more from that project again soon.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:40):**  So Nigel tell us what woofing is.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:42):**  The acronym stands for willing workers on organic farms and actually no no hang on hang  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:51):**  on it's world wide opportunities on organic farms but it used to be I think it started  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:10:58):**  out as weekend workers and then it was willing workers but they basically took the work out  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:03):**  of it because it's like it's a voluntary thing.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:08):**  So essentially they've it's evolved over 45 years so they actually had their 45th birthday  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:15):**  recently I think it was held in Cumbria which is pretty impressive for an organisation and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:20):**  it really you know it started from very humble beginnings in a small farm a table hearse  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:27):**  farm in Forest Row so actually not very far from our farm in East Sussex and from very  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:32):**  small seed it's grown into this huge like global organisation it's used by thousands  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:39):**  hundreds of thousands of people and it's a great way of farmers hosting people interested  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:45):**  in learning about food and doing some work on a farm.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:50):**  So Carolyn from the Food Assembly spoke to Barbara from Babins Wood Farm in Trupshire  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:54):**  for us to hear all about their woofing experiences.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah I think the woofing idea is a really good idea we've been a woof host for four  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:05):**  years now we get people from all over the world they all seem to enjoy coming to our  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:12):**  place some have some experience of growing or working with animals and others have absolutely  
**[0:12:18-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:18):**  no experience a lot of people come because they want to learn the language which is fine  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:26):**  but what our aim with having woofers is to educate in environmental issues we try to  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:34):**  show them films as well in the evenings to encourage them to look at things to teach  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:39):**  them about the importance of organic farming not using pesticides and chemicals and also  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:45):**  not to waste as well and we find actually most people have a really good time they work  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:51):**  very hard overall it's been a really good experience the slight downside of it is if  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:12:56):**  you only get people for a very short time by the time they've got into the routine then  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:02):**  it's you know they're off again but if they can come for at least a month then that's  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:06):**  not an issue they soon get into things the other issue is it does mean that you have  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:12):**  people in your house all the time which works well for me but other members of the family  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:16):**  aren't always that happy about it so that's something we we need to work around the other  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:24):**  thing I was going to say was one of the things when I was first introduced to the idea some  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:28):**  maybe six seven years ago I said I haven't got time to look after people but as it turns  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:33):**  out we have fairly big groups of woofers and basically they run a rota and they cook for  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:39):**  themselves or and cook for me as well so that's all part of the experience and I think that  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:45):**  encourages and we have a we make a rota up and that actually encourages them to work  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:49):**  with each other and not necessarily with a person they've come with so they all meet  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:54):**  people from other countries and other cultures as well but all the time we're reinforcing  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:13:58):**  the the organic the environmental the sustainability of it and as far I would much prefer to use  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:05):**  human power than oil so for me it's a brilliant scheme personally I think the garden does  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:13):**  rely on the voluntary help because there's not a lot of money in growing vegetables but  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:19):**  if somebody can have an experience and in return give their labour then it's a win-win  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:26):**  situation I don't feel that we exploit them because they seem to enjoy what they do that  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:34):**  is an accusation that sometimes levels but it's not been the feedback we get really good  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:39):**  feedback from them they will fill in a book when they leave and write nice messages to  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:44):**  us and and quite a few have come back as well I've come back for a second or even third  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:48):**  time if you want to find out more about woofing there's lots of info online it really is a  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:53):**  great way to explore the countryside and fields we're often so far removed from as well as  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:14:58):**  learning about farming and growing in different lands I've always wanted to do some woofing  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:03):**  abroad and I have kind of worked on different organic farms at different times and you it's  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:08):**  a whole new experience and a way of meeting people from that culture to me it's almost  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:13):**  identical to internships so I would say that almost every company in the world you know  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:19):**  they seem to have internships and there you're only in the UK legally having to get paid  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:23):**  150 pounds a week whereas with a woofing you're getting room and board and food yeah so I  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:30):**  mean it is a it's a pretty good deal I think it's a great deal and I don't think people  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:33):**  should feel bad about it although I do agree that we should have agriculture where we can  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:39):**  pay for the labor just through the produce itself that would be the ideal it's kind of  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:45):**  coming back to our point earlier where we were talking about you know farmers receiving  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:49):**  a fair price for their produce and you know again it's like woofing with I don't know  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:54):**  if it highlights this but there is a problem especially with vegetable production and horticulture  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:15:59):**  it's this culture of you know trying to I know almost produce it at below the cost of  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:06):**  production and it's just not it's not sustainable.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:15):**  Now we've got a special report from Farm Hack recorded by regular contributors Abby and  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:20):**  Keisha. It's really great to see Keisha and Abby working together on this. Neither of  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:25):**  them had met before the event and a year ago had not recorded any audio in their lives  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:30):**  so it's lovely to see what Farmorama has become especially since the first UK Farm Hack was  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:35):**  where we had the idea for making a podcast in the first place.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:39):**  Heya it's Abby Aspin here from Future Farm Lab reporting from the Scottish Highlands  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:43):**  of Farm Hack Scotland. This weekend sees a series of workshops discussions and debates  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:49):**  about the hurdles within our system from how to acquire land to fixing tools.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:16:54):**  The word hack you might think in common parlance nowadays has got negative connotations to  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:00):**  it but in actual fact the introduction to us at Farm Hack talked about where the word  
**[0:17:06-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:06):**  comes from and hack originally referred to hackney ponies which were ponies that rather  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:14):**  than having specific specialist uses so for racing or ploughing etc they were used for  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:21):**  a variety of things and that's kind of what us as farmers or small holders do we do bits  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:29):**  and pieces of everything.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:31):**  My name is Laura.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:33):**  My name is Andrew.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:35):**  We're here because we've been interested in creating a small holding or finding a  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:41):**  croft for a number of years now and we just had an offer accepted on a designation of  
**[0:17:46-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:46):**  a croft on the Isle of Lewis and so we wanted to meet other people who are involved in doing  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:17:55):**  similar things, hear some other people's ideas and experiences and learn some of the  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:00):**  techniques that we'd like to use and in particular some old techniques the skills that have been  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:06):**  lost through a mechanisation of farming.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:11):**  So we learnt how to use a scythe today which is very interesting and useful in fact we're  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:18):**  going to buy a scythe before we go today.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:20):**  What kind of scythe are you going to buy?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:23):**  We're going to buy a Norwegian scythe from this man here Charlie and a hand scythe for  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:30):**  the steep hill and cutting the heather.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:33):**  And we now have a new rake as well.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah you made a rake.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:38):**  Yes we do.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:40):**  We built a rake with woodworking techniques, all hand tools, splitting fibres.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:49):**  Neil Donaldson, I live in Kintyre which is on the west coast of Scotland and we have  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:18:56):**  a two acre wild garden over there about half a mile from the beach.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:04):**  I was saying earlier on that I think one of the things I really enjoyed was the blacksmithing.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:14):**  I like the idea which is a kind of thing that's being lost in rural areas now is this kind  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:21):**  of make do and mend aspect.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:25):**  This way the past generations of farmers and rural people used to work but those people  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:34):**  have kind of died out so it doesn't happen so much.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:37):**  So it's quite nice to see somebody making things from scrap and repairing things which  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:45):**  I think in today's life whether you're in a, even if you're in a city, you know, we  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:51):**  can't afford to keep on using resources the way we are.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:19:54):**  My name is Ruth Hancock and I run a small organic vegetable farm in Devon where I operate  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:01):**  vegetable box scheme to market vegetables alongside free range chickens that we tractor  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:09):**  in amongst the vegetables.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:12):**  I'm involved in and we're looking at initially is agroecology, agroecological farming a good  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:22):**  thing and the conclusion has generally been yes.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:25):**  Now we're looking at very practical real world solutions or little tweaks that maybe we can  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:31):**  make in the system to make it possible for more of that to happen.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:36):**  Cool.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:37):**  And what have you thought of the workshops?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:39):**  Did you know if you learned something new with those?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:42):**  I've learned lots of new things.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:43):**  I was very excited and inspired by the Mac Lab people with their bespoke recreation of  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:53):**  maybe old parts for machinery but new applications and one offs rather than having to buy something  
**[0:20:59-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:20:59):**  where you have a 200,000 round of production and just have something that fits your system.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:08):**  I'm Richard Clifford and we've got Alan Rockhead and we're both from Mac Lab which is a network  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:14):**  of makers spaces across Scotland focused on the empowerment of people through making.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:19):**  I know nothing about the processes, about the science behind it but hugely fascinated  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:26):**  how we can use sort of citizen led making and prototyping to change those systems.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:34):**  So I thought when I came in that you guys were predominantly 3D printing but you're  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:37):**  so much more than that so what was the range of things that you look at?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:42):**  We don't like to limit ourselves.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:44):**  We pretty much say we can work with any material, any process or we'll at least give it a tent  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:49):**  at it.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:50):**  So things like the smaller scale like 3D printing through to textiles up to large scale industrial  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:21:58):**  processes like CNC routing, plasma cutting, even welding and traditional, some traditional  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:04):**  things like that.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:07):**  A lot of the time our focus is on the individual and what they want to achieve in a purely  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:13):**  practical sense where they are just to facilitate them making something.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:18):**  So that can be a product designer who wants to create a new product to take to market  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:23):**  but our social purpose is more to look at how we use making as a means of empowering  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:28):**  people that can revolutionise and change their own situation, their own life, their own sort  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:34):**  of skill set.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:35):**  So that can be working with people who perhaps have a disability and want to create a device  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:41):**  that will change their life or it can be working with somebody in industry and to come up with  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:46):**  a new product, a new process that allows them to transform the way that things have been  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:51):**  done or tackle the way things could maybe be done in the future.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:56):**  Has anyone come up to you with any problems today?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah, we've had some, we've had some architecture, we've had some domestic, we've had some livestock  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:05):**  related, all sorts of different things.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:09):**  Some of the interesting ones we're just about to go into a sort of plenary session to get  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:14):**  everyone together, pin those ideas onto a washing line and then everyone sort of co-ops  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:21):**  the problems and shares the problems.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:23):**  So we've had people looking at how they might repair devices or equipment, how they might  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:30):**  change the design of something because it doesn't quite work properly.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:35):**  One in particular being a gentleman who has a very efficient rake that no modern rake  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:42):**  will do the same task, it won't grade the soil in the same way.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:47):**  So we're going to 3D scan that to allow us to then work with a digital model and try  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:52):**  and understand the difference between what might the characteristics of his 70s rake  
**[0:23:58-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:23:58):**  be versus the modern Chinese model that's not doing the same job.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:14):**  So what did I take away from Farmhack?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:17):**  Well we all crave community, whether we'd be living in central London or out in the  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:21):**  Scottish Highlands and that's what Farmhack's all about.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:24):**  Brainstorming, connecting with the land, presenting problems and investigating solutions, sharing  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:29):**  ideas, learning, inspiration and well fun.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:33):**  Not only was it about work but we sang, danced, cooked, laughed, swam, yep in the icy lot  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:39):**  and had a bloody good time.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:42):**  I think that we often make the mistake of talking about our food and farming system  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:45):**  with these big umbrella terms like the meat industry or crop production and actually forget  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:51):**  the people and small communities often involved in actually making our food.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:24:55):**  It was amazing seeing people sharing old school practices, combining them with new ones and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:00):**  evolving.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:01):**  I think we're very quick to condemn older practices as inefficient or pre-modern when  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:06):**  sometimes they're actually more modern than our current conventional practices.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:10):**  Some may see this as an idealistic view but the more I delve into the spectrum of small  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:14):**  scale to industrial agriculture, I can't believe that economically, socially, environmentally  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:20):**  and politically that industrial farming is the way forward.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:24):**  As all these aspects plus more need to be considered in food and farming.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:28):**  But mostly what I took away from Farmhack is that farming can be rather solitary and  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:33):**  to entice more people in and support the people already working in the sector, more of these  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:37):**  events will be appreciated to promote the feeling you're just not alone.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:43):**  Thank you to Abby and Keisha for that report.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:45):**  We'll no doubt be hearing from both of them in the future and many more of the projects  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:49):**  which have come out of Farmhack.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:54):**  We tend not to have themed episodes because we like that each week it's a bit of a mixed  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:25:58):**  bag but sometimes things just seem to come together.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:01):**  This week there's been a bit of an unconscious focus on things making use of waste products  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:06):**  or mending things or finding new uses for things such as Patrick's cuffs.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:11):**  Or the soil sands squeezed out from your morning cup of tea.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:15):**  Or also tinkering away in a field in Scotland.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:18):**  In these stretch times this is something which is always going to be relevant for farmers  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:22):**  and it's a recurring theme in Farmerama generally.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:25):**  Do you have any ideas for how to make the best of this?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:30):**  We'd love to hear from you either at farmeramaradio.com or by joining the community on Facebook or

**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:48):**  exploration of this though not limited to agriculture.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:52):**  And a second podcast recommendation for you is the Female Farmer Project who released  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:56):**  their first episode last week.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15#t=0:26:59):**  We've been fans of their photo project for some time.

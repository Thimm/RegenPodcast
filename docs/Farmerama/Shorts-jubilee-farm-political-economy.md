**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:00):**  We're between episodes, but bringing you something a little extra this month. A short with our  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:08):**  friend Jonny Hanson from Jubilee Farm in Northern Ireland, with an introduction to political  
**[0:00:13-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:13):**  economy in relation to food and farming.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:22):**  In the sustainable food movement we often spend a lot of time thinking about what food  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:26):**  systems are based on. Are they based on soil or oil? Are they based on uniformity or diversity?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:33):**  But the other axis on which food sustainability turns is how food systems are controlled.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:40):**  Who wins? Who loses? Who benefits? Who has a seat at the table when decisions are made?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:46):**  And in food sustainability we tend to call that concept food sovereignty. But food sovereignty  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:51):**  is part of a bigger body of knowledge and thinking and research called political economy.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:00:57):**  And to delve into what political economy is I'm joined this month by Jon Barry who is  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:02):**  Professor of Green Political Economy at Queen's University Belfast.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:10):**  So Jon, what is political economy and how does it relate to food and farming?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:16):**  Political economy very simply is the issues of power of control over assets and resources.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:23):**  And in particular it's bringing home to us that the economy is created politically, whether  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:29):**  it's a market-based economy or a centrally planned one, that we cannot separate out economics  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:35):**  from the political system. And therefore issues of how the government and its regulations  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:41):**  can favour or impinge corporations and so on are absolutely central to the understanding  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:48):**  of the conjoining of politics and economics. And that's what political economy is.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:55):**  In relation to food and farming in particular?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:01:57):**  Well obviously in relation to food and farming and our food system, political economy would  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:02):**  look at the structure of the global market in food, in particular commodities, the way  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:08):**  in which we have an increasing corporatisation at both ends of our food system in terms of  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:14):**  both production, in terms of large companies controlling fertilisers, our industrialised  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:20):**  model of farming is also a marketised and corporatised form of farming. But also then  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:26):**  at the retail end, how for example in the UK there are five major multiples in terms  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:33):**  of Tesco's and Sainsbury's who actually control our food system. And this has knock-on effects  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:39):**  in terms of the price these companies and corporations can pay to farmers, but also  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:45):**  the types of farming and the types of food we as consumers and citizens get is as a structure  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:51):**  of the way the political economy of food and agriculture is organised.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:02:55):**  At Jubilee Farm our share offer which is raising just over Â£300,000 to set up Northern Ireland's  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:01):**  first community farm is an exercise in political economy because for the first time we're involving  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:07):**  people not only in the ownership of a farm here in Northern Ireland, but also through  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:12):**  our CSA scheme in the production and consumption of food, sharing the risks and the rewards  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:18):**  between people who eat food and people who produce food.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:22):**  So John, based on your research and interests as an academic, can you give us any examples  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:28):**  of political economy and food and farming in action?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:33):**  Well one I can give you, it's more of a movement which has had various impacts globally, is  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:37):**  La Via Campesina, a global movement of peasant based small farmers often in the global south  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:44):**  but also in the global north that is part of the food sovereignty movement and they  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:51):**  are certainly fighting against this corporatisation and privatisation of our food system.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:03:58):**  And indeed you can look at many examples similar to what you're doing in Jubilee of going  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:04):**  outside simply the state and the market and seeing that the community is also a source  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:09):**  of power and obviously of interest in terms of ways in which we can reconfigure the ownership  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:16):**  of land, the use of land in terms of growing food, distributing food and so on.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:23):**  And indeed to put it more romantically perhaps, the issue of a community based initiative  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:28):**  around food and agriculture is where the head, the hand and the heart actually come together  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:34):**  in a nice synergy.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:36):**  And I think there are many such examples of community supported agriculture across Europe  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:42):**  and the world but for me one of the most inspiring ones is La Via Campesina.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:47):**  Another less positive example of political economy in action recently in Northern Ireland  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:52):**  is a recent scandal over a renewable energy scheme and its abuse by various vested interests  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:04:59):**  including the factory chicken industry.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:02):**  And the poultry company from Northern Ireland that had various awkward questions to answer  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:08):**  about that, its then Brazilian owner at the time was also facing awkward questions at  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:14):**  the same time about bribing the Brazilian presidents.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:16):**  So in a globalised economy issues of political economy happen in Northern Ireland and right  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:22):**  across the world.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:23):**  Which is why as the Good Book reminds us, the love of money is the root of all kinds  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:28):**  of evil.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:29):**  Which is why at Jubilee our political economy is very simple and very profound and it's  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-jubilee-farm-political-economy#t=0:05:35):**  this that markets and states should serve people and places and not the other way round.

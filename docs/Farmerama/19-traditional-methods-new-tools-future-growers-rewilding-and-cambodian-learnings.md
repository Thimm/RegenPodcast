### Farmerama  (2017-03-11)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmerama, bringing you stories about smaller scale sustainable farming from  around the world. This month we bring you Joel Salatin talking traditional methods and  modern tools. We have our first foray into the rewilding debate with Steve Carver of  
**[0:00:24-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:24):**  the Wildland Research Institute, dispatches from the Soil Association's Future Growers  Apprenticeship and agricultural learnings in far off lands from the Green Shoots Foundation.  Abby welcome back to the country. Regular listeners will know that you've been spending  
**[0:00:46-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:46):**  some time at your family's farm in Chile. So in the last episode we had a report from  you as you were basically watching the wildfires that have been in the country just sort of  approach your farm. I know that everybody will be really keen to hear just how has the  
**[0:01:05-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:05):**  last month been for you? What happened? Yeah it was all a bit crazy and the day that Farmerama  was released last month was the day or the night that the fire actually came through  our farm and burnt almost everything. The firefighters saved the houses and most of  
**[0:01:22-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  the farm buildings but all of the olives and grapes were black when we came back the next  morning. We lost all our water systems and electricity and everything. But farming is  a risky business and you have to be resilient. Just you know we talk about resilient plants  
**[0:01:40-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:40):**  well we have to be resilient too so immediately we got back to rebuilding our water system  and then as soon as we could we gave the plants some water. Like how do you go about rebuilding?  How is that going to affect you? How much have you lost? Well we've lost two years of  
**[0:01:57-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:57):**  harvest for sure. All the trees that were planted in the last two years they totally  burned most of them and they won't grow back but anything else will. When I was leaving  the farm yesterday we went round and had a look and many of the trees had signs of new  
**[0:02:15-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  growth which is amazing. Just two weeks after the fire passed through they're starting again  and the vines as well so we'll just have to see how the recovery goes. I know lots of  people were thinking of you we got lots of really supportive messages and I'm certainly  
**[0:02:33-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  going to look forward to hearing how you're getting on with rebuilding everything you've  spent so long making. Thanks. On Farmerama we want to highlight great farming and technology  that supports farming. Often there can be some tension in our community between traditional  
**[0:03:01-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:01):**  farming methods and what people think of as technology. Here Virginia-based animal farmer  Joel Salatin who we've had on the show before talks us through a few examples which I think  perfectly illustrate the applications of technology that we're excited about on Farmerama. Well  
**[0:03:21-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:21):**  I guess one good context for it was it really struck me when I was asked by the Thomas Jefferson  Foundation at Monticello to deliver a talk at their heritage festival and so I went through  Thomas Jefferson's farm book as his wonderful big all his farm book notes and I pulled out  
**[0:03:45-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  all the places where he was frustrated and of course for you Britishers Thomas Jefferson  was the author of the Declaration of Independence and called King George a lot of bad names.  So I teased out all of these and what was really neat was the epiphany for me was wow  
**[0:04:08-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  all these frustrations we now have technological answers for. So for example he was frustrated  about his first frustration was how to control all these animals and it took all these at  that time slaves slave kids to keep the animals out of the garden out of the orchard out of  
**[0:04:25-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  the barley fields you know and so he had all these kids slave children employed all the  time protecting you know vulnerable stuff because fencing was too expensive. I mean  they didn't have wire yet really and wooden fencing was I mean they didn't have you know  
**[0:04:48-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:48):**  chainsaws anyway it was very arduous or laborious to build a fence and so today we've got electric  fence which is just cheap it's cheap cheap and extremely portable so you know we have  control. Another one was shelter how do you how do you provide shelter and of course the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:07):**  whole thing so what the problem was you have all these campsites around your farm under  the few shade trees right and so you're moving fertility from one spot to another one place  is gradually depleting in fertility another place is building up not only too much fertility  
**[0:05:25-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  but an incubator for pathogens because there's always stuff there. So now we have we have  the ability to mill tinker toys okay I mean in that day with you know the pit sawmill  where a guy up top and a guy down the bottom you know you couldn't you couldn't afford to  
**[0:05:45-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:45):**  make small dimension lumber it was too laborious to cut. Today with little bandsaw mills with  a tenth of an inch kerf we can now make tinker toys so we can have real lightweight ambulatory  shelters to move the fertility around in the fields wherever we want to move it around  
**[0:06:03-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  and the third one I would just say third one was of course water how do you get water any  place without pipes without pumps there was no way to actually you know send water any  place. Today we have black plastic pipe you know polyethylene pipe or PVC and we can very  
**[0:06:24-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:24):**  cheaply and very and simple wonderful pumps and we can now send water uphill so that we  can deliver it strategically exactly where it needs to be to be fully leveraged. This  list goes on and on but it's really when I look at this I'm just struck by how yes we  
**[0:06:47-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:47):**  are looking back at multi-speciation animal movement pasture-based perennial based these  wonderful historic overall ideas but we can now participate with them in in 2020 hindsight  of 21st century infrastructure and it really really changes the actual cost and outworking  
**[0:07:17-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  of the system. Clearly rotational grazing is not new but what is new are the electric  mesh fences and polyethylene pipe that allow Joel to quickly and easily move the animals  around 400 acres ensuring they're safe from predators and have ample water supply without  
**[0:07:36-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:36):**  any expensive infrastructure. Joel calls this new fashioned farming where systems such as  cow feed lots and high chemical input systems are now old-fashioned. Their costs to the  land and ecosystems have demonstrated the perceived efficiencies for short term. The  
**[0:07:53-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:53):**  mix of traditional methods with simple modern tools and tech offers a longer-term possibility  for feeding the world. For the cynical farmers out there saying oh yeah of course Joel Salatin  says that but he's a celebrity farmer. Well we have an example from much closer to home.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  Andrew Brewster and his brother have cattle on 900 acres up in Angus Scotland. He tells  us about the low-tech tools and setup that they put together to get their rotational  grazing off the ground. We started rotational grazing after reading a book by Andre Voson  
**[0:08:27-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:27):**  and to start off with we were moving the cows every three days which isn't so labor intensive.  Now we're moving cows usually two times a day but in extreme weather we'll use them  four times a day and this is to avoid poaching in the rain or snow or whatever. When we move  
**[0:08:45-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:45):**  the cows we have a ladder system so we have steel wire lanes, a high tensile wire of 100  meters in width so we'll cross these lanes almost like a ladder, like the rungs of a  ladder with temporary fences. We peel back the fence every day, allow the cows forward  
**[0:09:04-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:04):**  to the next grass, forward for the grass and then we move the water trough which is a bathtub  on wheels with a ball cock and that's fed with a portable water pipe, almost like an  umbilical system so we move that. Then we move the mineral feeder which is an old feeder  
**[0:09:26-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:26):**  used for feeding grain to cattle but it's got wheels and it's got a waterproof flap  so the cows, the minerals don't get wet and then we also have this pipe and winding kit  which is a trailer of a drum, a big wooden drum that's used by the electrical companies  
**[0:09:46-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  for laying cable and we use that to wind up the pipe, manually wind up the water pipe  so we can move them onto the new field or we can lay more pipe when needed. And the  system only works because we can supply water to every part of the farm, even the very tops  
**[0:10:05-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  of the hills and this is done by using a hydraulic ram pump which is a 18th century French technology,  a series of valves that uses the force of water to pump water up a hill and that is  the most fascinating thing to watch. We found out about this by watching videos on YouTube  
**[0:10:22-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:22):**  and then we built one ourselves, it's just incredible.  Now to something that has caused much debate and upset amongst farmers, conservationists  and wildlife fans alike, rewilding. It's easy to see the excitement that beavers and  
**[0:10:56-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:56):**  wolves in the wilderness can generate. This is something that appeals to many people conceptually  but it's controversial. How is it relevant to the everyday smaller scale farmer?  At last month's Oxford Real Farming Conference, Joy Rose met Steve Carver, Director of the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:12):**  Wildland Research Institute, a community with an international membership who are based  out of the University of Leeds in the UK. He chatted to Joy about how small scale farmers  can continue to produce good food whilst still improving the wild aspects of the land.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:27):**  There's a very broad spectrum of approaches and levels which may be constituted rewilding  but in essence in a farming context it very much depends on the level at which the individual  farmer is willing to go down that route of becoming I suppose less intense in terms of  
**[0:11:56-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:56):**  the level of farm management and the production on the land is one way so it's that sort of  land, it comes down to land sharing or land sparing I suppose. If you're into intensive  arable agriculture with very large fields, highly mechanised then you know that is not  
**[0:12:13-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:13):**  that kind of a landscape, that farming landscape is not really appropriate for rewilding. If  you're a small farm with maybe a few sheep and some cattle and some forestry on there,  some agroforestry on there then there are lots of opportunities and it might be an element  
**[0:12:33-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:33):**  as I say of either land sharing in that you're reducing the intensity of farming across your  land to make more space for nature and natural processes or that land sparing in the case  of putting aside a bit of that land for woodland or riparian woodland or creating wetlands  
**[0:12:56-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:56):**  or whatever that may be and as I say it will be very context specific. So I'm a geographer,  I'm very interested in the spatial context, landscape context of land use and rewilding  is an element of that. Going through all of the continuum of landscape uses through extensive  
**[0:13:18-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:18):**  farming, grazing land, whatever, through to intensive arable and then to industrial and  urban at one end of the spatial spectrum through on the other end of the spectrum to pristine  wilderness. I know we don't have pristine wilderness in Britain but we do have some  
**[0:13:33-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:33):**  wild spaces and some wild places. Now rewilding then sits somewhere in the middle of that  in between extensive farming and wilderness. That's rewilding is attempting to move in  one direction along that landscape continuum. Now in a spatial setting you might be thinking  
**[0:13:54-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  about core areas of wild land. There may be sites of special scientific interest, there  may be whole catchment landscape scale, core areas which we may be looking at in the future  but then how they connect across the landscape is the key in that currently protected areas  
**[0:14:18-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:18):**  in conservation management tend to be islands. They're green islands in a sea of urban and  agriculture and other land uses. We tend to set them aside, put a ring around them and  say that's for nature. Now the problem is with that is if we're talking about things  
**[0:14:35-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:35):**  like issues like climate change and migration of species and reintroductions of formerly  native species is that if you put those, if you place them in that island context they've  got nowhere to go. They're isolated. So if we can create with landowner buy-in we can  
**[0:14:56-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  create corridors, they're green corridors or blue corridors if you're thinking about  riparian corridors or coastal corridors which allow species to migrate north south up the  mountain, down the mountain in response to climate change and other drivers then that's  
**[0:15:13-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:13):**  really where current conservation thinking is going. It's about connecting up and creating  space for wildlife within our existing land use matrix, matrices which our abilities and  grazing and other types of farming are part of. So these corridors can be different types.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  They can be green corridors, riparian corridors, they can be stepping stones of smaller areas  of wilder land which species can jump from. They can be permeable corridors with more  extensive or less intensive land use, that sort of thing.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  And what did you think about the comment about agroforestry being sort of interchangeable  almost with the word rewilding?  Yeah, I mean, to be honest I really don't know too much about agroforestry but I understand  
**[0:16:09-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:09):**  the basic principle. But as I say, rewilding is a continuum and if you're moving from let's  say grazing land to agroforestry land, that's moving you further towards the wild end of  the spectrum. So it's, and certain species and natural processes will benefit. There's  
**[0:16:28-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:28):**  been a lot of talk about how reforesting certain parts of the landscape, particularly let's  say gill sides or riparian woodlands, can help reduce flood peaks, attenuate flood peaks  and reduce the downstream flooding problem. So agroforestry in that context may have a  
**[0:16:48-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  benefit. But I think, and if you insert an extant species like beaver into that landscape,  you've got a conflict. Agroforestry is about producing, let's say it might be wood fuel,  it might be wood for construction, whatever. And if you've got beaver in that landscape  
**[0:17:06-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:06):**  then you're going to, a certain amount of loss is going to be implied. But then the  benefits of the beaver will accrue to one of the other primary roles of agroforestry  in terms of reducing flood peaks. So it's a juggling act in terms of establishing what  
**[0:17:23-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:23):**  exactly you're doing the agroforestry for. Is it purely for timber production? Is it  wood fuel? Is it for its biodiversity benefits? Is it for its flood reduction benefits, in  which case the beaver fits in with that? Or is it for something else? Is it aesthetics?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:40):**  Is it a wood forest product?  Joy Rose for Farmerama speaking to Steve Carver. If you're looking to further understand  the broad scope of projects that fall under the banner of rewilding, the Rewilding Britain  
**[0:17:53-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:53):**  website is a great place to start.  The aspect of this debate that we find most worrying is that farming is pitted against  rewilding often. Like the two can't work together. I'm glad to hear Steve saying that  
**[0:18:08-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:08):**  this is not the case, that there are many different degrees of rewilding, and agroforestry  is one example. I guess where the sticking point comes is how much of your crop, be that  trees or berries or whatever, is it plausible to leave for the wild animals? So for example  
**[0:18:25-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:25):**  with beavers, you could lose some trees to their gnawing, but on the plus side, they  build dams that prevent flooding for many years to come. So it's finding that balance.  This is something that we don't know too much about, and we'd really like to hear more  
**[0:18:39-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  farmers' opinions and thoughts on it. So please write us a quick comment on the Farmerama  radio Facebook page, or tweet us at Farmerama underscore underscore.  It was also clear that rewilding projects have the most impact if conceived as part  
**[0:18:55-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:55):**  of a collaboration across the landscape, between farmers in the valley and on the mountains,  in the south and to the north, as wilderness habitats need to be semi-continuous so animals  can migrate around. Are you working in collaboration with any fellow farmers, or know of any projects  
**[0:19:13-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:13):**  like this? We really would love to hear more.  Last summer we happened to be in Chagford on the same day as the Soil Association Future  Growers' apprentices on one of their Discovery Weekends. As part of the programme, these  
**[0:19:45-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  apprentices do a paid internship at a nominated farm. They also have a series of weekend trips  as a whole group to share their learnings and see other inspiring growing projects around  the UK. It was clear everyone was working hard and learning a lot as they go.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:03):**  Hello, my name's Laura. I am currently working at a farm in East Sussex called Terry Gardens  Farm and I started there in February. My first time on a farm was actually picking grapes  in France, I just wanted to know how to make wine and through that I heard about woofing  
**[0:20:17-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  and I woofed for a few years while I was initially applying for jobs in the NHS and I quickly  realised that the farm work was a lot more fun than anything I would be doing in the  NHS. And one of the woof farms that I worked for offered me a job just with a little stipend  
**[0:20:32-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:32):**  and I stayed there for six months working after maybe six months of woofing. And then  I heard about the Future Growers Scheme through a chance meeting with Rachel Harries who coordinates  it and I applied for a six month traineeship on a farm in Dorset called Gold Hill which  
**[0:20:47-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  practices no dig, grows vegetables on a no dig system. And I was there for six months  and I had a very interesting time supplying wholesale, I ran the market, we had a farm  shop and we also supplied a box scheme so it was really varied although very small scale.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:04):**  Well I definitely from today's visit to Chag Food I really liked how Ed was growing his  courgettes and his, well his kukubits through mypex and then at the end of the season leaving  the mypex down to help to clear the weeds ready for the carrots and parsnips the following  
**[0:21:22-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:22):**  year. That just seemed so elegant and simple and I'd like to use that one day in the future.  Hi I'm Saskia, I am currently an apprentice at Dalesford Organic. Jez, head grow there  asked me to go in as the seasonal picker with the strawberries so I moved in to the market  
**[0:21:43-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:43):**  garden 15 months ago to pick the strawberries and then stayed on after the picking had ended,  stayed on through the winter and then this year wanted to further my knowledge and find  out more about other farms and how to actually grow things and why we're doing the practices  
**[0:22:07-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:07):**  that we're doing so understanding why or as a picker I'm there picking strawberries but  how did the strawberries get there I didn't know, I hadn't done the decrowning, the weeding,  removing of runners, the kind of winter work that was yeah necessary to get the strawberries  
**[0:22:26-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:26):**  so for me it's kind of opened my eyes to a lot of asking a lot of questions I didn't  kind of know where you know existed or just seeing things through.  So I'm Rachel and I work for the Soil Association and I run the Future Growers Scheme and one  
**[0:22:43-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:43):**  of the things that we have is a Google group for people who are within the scheme and we've  got about 50 people, 50 members of that Google group and it's a really good place because  it's quite a safe space for people to ask questions of other people who are learning  
**[0:22:58-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:58):**  at the same time so people might be kind of less afraid of asking questions if they were  in a more experienced group so you get people asking questions about kind of you know what  sort of wellies are the best wellies to use, which are the wellies that are going to last  
**[0:23:11-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  a whole season or you know people sharing resources like websites or books or podcasts  that they like or things about you know where do you get your plastic bags for packing your  salad packs so kind of all these different questions, all sorts of different questions  
**[0:23:28-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:28):**  come up on it.  If this has sparked your interest find out more from the Soil Association online.  Before we end we're going to hear a project run by some listeners in Cambodia.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:40):**  Green Shoots is an NGO which supports the promotion of organic farming practices through  education programmes.  Operations Director Manizie Jaffrey prepared this report about the work the organisation  
**[0:23:51-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:51):**  has done over the last six years.  Hi my name is Manizie Jaffrey, I'm the operations manager of Green Shoots Foundation, a small  NGO based in London which was set up in 2010 by our founder John-Mark Debrecon.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:06):**  Our aim was to work in microfinance projects but very quickly we realised that to make  long-term impact we needed to work by investing in skills of people and giving them the ability  to go forward themselves.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:23):**  So in 2012 we started a pilot project in Cambodia relating to agriculture skills.  Our aim is to work with local partners, build their capacity and help them to fight poverty  and migration in this part of Cambodia.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:38):**  It's very close to the Thai border and young people will normally drop out of high school  and want to work in very high risk jobs.  But what we wanted to do was to demonstrate to youth that a rural economy can be thriving  
**[0:24:51-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:51):**  and help provide for their families.  So in 2014 this pilot project was scaled up to become the agriculture skills and public  school project.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:00):**  The aim here is to set up vegetable gardens in 42 public schools, train 47 teachers and  about 8,000 to 12,000 students.  We've dug new water ponds, improved water ponds where needed to help make these vegetable  
**[0:25:17-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:17):**  gardens thriving and now our local partner will talk more about activities on the ground.  My name is Ratna Un.  I'm 31 years old from Samrong, Odaminche province, northwest Cambodia.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:31):**  This region was the last province where the fighting with the Khmer Rouge and Polpo stopped  around 1997, 10 years after the rest of the country.  A lot of people who study at the university don't come back to this area as it's so poor.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:51):**  But I want to come back and help the future of our next generation, the children.  The project that I work for called ESPAS, Agriculture Skills and Public Schools in partnership  with Greenshoot Foundation, the UK charity.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:15):**  We are working with 43 schools in the area and over 70% of the teachers in this region  are also farmers.  Also most of schools start at 7 o'clock in the morning and finish around 11am so that  
**[0:26:36-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:36):**  the teacher can go off to the farms.  A lot of the children then have to go and help their parents too as they are also farmers.  Teachers will train about how to make compost, organic pesticide, set up the vegetable garden,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:59):**  especially about water irrigation because this area does not have much rain.  Right, and now I'm passing over to one of the teachers who got trained by ESPAS project.  He will then express about his organic vegetable garden.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:16):**  Chum Reap Sua, hi, my name is Jay Sua Luan.  I'm 31 years old.  I'm a teacher in Danish Primary School located in Adom-en-Che province, northwest Cambodia.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:31):**  About a month after my training, we chose a plot of land in the school for the vegetable  garden.  The teacher, students, and local community involved in digging, raising beds, building  
**[0:27:50-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  fence, preparing compost, pesticide, and setting up the water irrigation.  This is now our third cycle of growing vegetables.  The previous two harvests were pretty good and improved.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:10):**  The first crop were morning glory and lettuce.  Second crop were cucumber, yardlong beans, morning glory and lettuce.  Now growing in the vegetable garden, we have eggplant, tomatoes, lettuce, and morning glory.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:37):**  We share these harvests with children and sell some vegetables for seed for the next  cycle.  I expect that through this project, children, parents, and teachers are all interested and  
**[0:28:54-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:54):**  involved in the vegetable garden.  Some parents and children have started their own vegetable garden at home.  With all of their help, it has made the vegetable garden a big success.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:10):**  Thanks, Maneezy and Co.  It's always inspiring for us to hear from people on the ground in different countries.  It's the time of year when we are again believing that the sun is coming back and we're starting  
**[0:29:29-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:29):**  to think about all the ways the land is going to spring into life.  Thanks for joining us this month and we'll see you next time on Farmer Rama.

### Farmerama  (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 09:32:25)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmerama, bringing you stories about smaller scale sustainable farming from  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:13):**  around the world. This month we bring you Joel Salatin talking traditional methods and  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  modern tools. We have our first foray into the rewilding debate with Steve Carver of  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:24):**  the Wildland Research Institute, dispatches from the Soil Association's Future Growers  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:30):**  Apprenticeship and agricultural learnings in far off lands from the Green Shoots Foundation.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:42):**  Abby welcome back to the country. Regular listeners will know that you've been spending  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:46):**  some time at your family's farm in Chile. So in the last episode we had a report from  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:00:52):**  you as you were basically watching the wildfires that have been in the country just sort of  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:00):**  approach your farm. I know that everybody will be really keen to hear just how has the  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:05):**  last month been for you? What happened? Yeah it was all a bit crazy and the day that Farmerama  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:11):**  was released last month was the day or the night that the fire actually came through  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:16):**  our farm and burnt almost everything. The firefighters saved the houses and most of  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  the farm buildings but all of the olives and grapes were black when we came back the next  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:29):**  morning. We lost all our water systems and electricity and everything. But farming is  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:35):**  a risky business and you have to be resilient. Just you know we talk about resilient plants  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:40):**  well we have to be resilient too so immediately we got back to rebuilding our water system  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:46):**  and then as soon as we could we gave the plants some water. Like how do you go about rebuilding?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  How is that going to affect you? How much have you lost? Well we've lost two years of  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:01:57):**  harvest for sure. All the trees that were planted in the last two years they totally  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:03):**  burned most of them and they won't grow back but anything else will. When I was leaving  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:10):**  the farm yesterday we went round and had a look and many of the trees had signs of new  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  growth which is amazing. Just two weeks after the fire passed through they're starting again  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:22):**  and the vines as well so we'll just have to see how the recovery goes. I know lots of  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:27):**  people were thinking of you we got lots of really supportive messages and I'm certainly  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  going to look forward to hearing how you're getting on with rebuilding everything you've  
**[0:02:39-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:39):**  spent so long making. Thanks. On Farmerama we want to highlight great farming and technology  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:02:56):**  that supports farming. Often there can be some tension in our community between traditional  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:01):**  farming methods and what people think of as technology. Here Virginia-based animal farmer  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  Joel Salatin who we've had on the show before talks us through a few examples which I think  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:14):**  perfectly illustrate the applications of technology that we're excited about on Farmerama. Well  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:21):**  I guess one good context for it was it really struck me when I was asked by the Thomas Jefferson  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  Foundation at Monticello to deliver a talk at their heritage festival and so I went through  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:35):**  Thomas Jefferson's farm book as his wonderful big all his farm book notes and I pulled out  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  all the places where he was frustrated and of course for you Britishers Thomas Jefferson  
**[0:03:51-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  was the author of the Declaration of Independence and called King George a lot of bad names.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  So I teased out all of these and what was really neat was the epiphany for me was wow  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  all these frustrations we now have technological answers for. So for example he was frustrated  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:14):**  about his first frustration was how to control all these animals and it took all these at  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:21):**  that time slaves slave kids to keep the animals out of the garden out of the orchard out of  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  the barley fields you know and so he had all these kids slave children employed all the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:32):**  time protecting you know vulnerable stuff because fencing was too expensive. I mean  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:41):**  they didn't have wire yet really and wooden fencing was I mean they didn't have you know  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:48):**  chainsaws anyway it was very arduous or laborious to build a fence and so today we've got electric  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:04:55):**  fence which is just cheap it's cheap cheap and extremely portable so you know we have  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  control. Another one was shelter how do you how do you provide shelter and of course the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:07):**  whole thing so what the problem was you have all these campsites around your farm under  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:13):**  the few shade trees right and so you're moving fertility from one spot to another one place  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:19):**  is gradually depleting in fertility another place is building up not only too much fertility  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  but an incubator for pathogens because there's always stuff there. So now we have we have  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:32):**  the ability to mill tinker toys okay I mean in that day with you know the pit sawmill  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:40):**  where a guy up top and a guy down the bottom you know you couldn't you couldn't afford to  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:45):**  make small dimension lumber it was too laborious to cut. Today with little bandsaw mills with  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:51):**  a tenth of an inch kerf we can now make tinker toys so we can have real lightweight ambulatory  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:05:57):**  shelters to move the fertility around in the fields wherever we want to move it around  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  and the third one I would just say third one was of course water how do you get water any  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:08):**  place without pipes without pumps there was no way to actually you know send water any  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:16):**  place. Today we have black plastic pipe you know polyethylene pipe or PVC and we can very  
**[0:06:24-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:24):**  cheaply and very and simple wonderful pumps and we can now send water uphill so that we  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  can deliver it strategically exactly where it needs to be to be fully leveraged. This  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  list goes on and on but it's really when I look at this I'm just struck by how yes we  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:47):**  are looking back at multi-speciation animal movement pasture-based perennial based these  
**[0:06:53-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:06:53):**  wonderful historic overall ideas but we can now participate with them in in 2020 hindsight  
**[0:07:06-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:06):**  of 21st century infrastructure and it really really changes the actual cost and outworking  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  of the system. Clearly rotational grazing is not new but what is new are the electric  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  mesh fences and polyethylene pipe that allow Joel to quickly and easily move the animals  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:29):**  around 400 acres ensuring they're safe from predators and have ample water supply without  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:36):**  any expensive infrastructure. Joel calls this new fashioned farming where systems such as  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  cow feed lots and high chemical input systems are now old-fashioned. Their costs to the  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:47):**  land and ecosystems have demonstrated the perceived efficiencies for short term. The  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:53):**  mix of traditional methods with simple modern tools and tech offers a longer-term possibility  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:07:58):**  for feeding the world. For the cynical farmers out there saying oh yeah of course Joel Salatin  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  says that but he's a celebrity farmer. Well we have an example from much closer to home.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  Andrew Brewster and his brother have cattle on 900 acres up in Angus Scotland. He tells  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:16):**  us about the low-tech tools and setup that they put together to get their rotational  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  grazing off the ground. We started rotational grazing after reading a book by Andre Voson  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:27):**  and to start off with we were moving the cows every three days which isn't so labor intensive.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  Now we're moving cows usually two times a day but in extreme weather we'll use them  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:39):**  four times a day and this is to avoid poaching in the rain or snow or whatever. When we move  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:45):**  the cows we have a ladder system so we have steel wire lanes, a high tensile wire of 100  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:51):**  meters in width so we'll cross these lanes almost like a ladder, like the rungs of a  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:08:58):**  ladder with temporary fences. We peel back the fence every day, allow the cows forward  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:04):**  to the next grass, forward for the grass and then we move the water trough which is a bathtub  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:11):**  on wheels with a ball cock and that's fed with a portable water pipe, almost like an  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:18):**  umbilical system so we move that. Then we move the mineral feeder which is an old feeder  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:26):**  used for feeding grain to cattle but it's got wheels and it's got a waterproof flap  
**[0:09:30-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:30):**  so the cows, the minerals don't get wet and then we also have this pipe and winding kit  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:39):**  which is a trailer of a drum, a big wooden drum that's used by the electrical companies  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  for laying cable and we use that to wind up the pipe, manually wind up the water pipe  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:51):**  so we can move them onto the new field or we can lay more pipe when needed. And the  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  system only works because we can supply water to every part of the farm, even the very tops  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  of the hills and this is done by using a hydraulic ram pump which is a 18th century French technology,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:12):**  a series of valves that uses the force of water to pump water up a hill and that is  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:17):**  the most fascinating thing to watch. We found out about this by watching videos on YouTube  
**[0:10:22-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:22):**  and then we built one ourselves, it's just incredible.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  Now to something that has caused much debate and upset amongst farmers, conservationists  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:49):**  and wildlife fans alike, rewilding. It's easy to see the excitement that beavers and  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:10:56):**  wolves in the wilderness can generate. This is something that appeals to many people conceptually  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:02):**  but it's controversial. How is it relevant to the everyday smaller scale farmer?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:08):**  At last month's Oxford Real Farming Conference, Joy Rose met Steve Carver, Director of the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:12):**  Wildland Research Institute, a community with an international membership who are based  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:17):**  out of the University of Leeds in the UK. He chatted to Joy about how small scale farmers  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:22):**  can continue to produce good food whilst still improving the wild aspects of the land.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:27):**  There's a very broad spectrum of approaches and levels which may be constituted rewilding  
**[0:11:36-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:36):**  but in essence in a farming context it very much depends on the level at which the individual  
**[0:11:45-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:45):**  farmer is willing to go down that route of becoming I suppose less intense in terms of  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:11:56):**  the level of farm management and the production on the land is one way so it's that sort of  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:03):**  land, it comes down to land sharing or land sparing I suppose. If you're into intensive  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:09):**  arable agriculture with very large fields, highly mechanised then you know that is not  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:13):**  that kind of a landscape, that farming landscape is not really appropriate for rewilding. If  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:20):**  you're a small farm with maybe a few sheep and some cattle and some forestry on there,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:28):**  some agroforestry on there then there are lots of opportunities and it might be an element  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:33):**  as I say of either land sharing in that you're reducing the intensity of farming across your  
**[0:12:40-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:40):**  land to make more space for nature and natural processes or that land sparing in the case  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:49):**  of putting aside a bit of that land for woodland or riparian woodland or creating wetlands  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:12:56):**  or whatever that may be and as I say it will be very context specific. So I'm a geographer,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:02):**  I'm very interested in the spatial context, landscape context of land use and rewilding  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:10):**  is an element of that. Going through all of the continuum of landscape uses through extensive  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:18):**  farming, grazing land, whatever, through to intensive arable and then to industrial and  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:23):**  urban at one end of the spatial spectrum through on the other end of the spectrum to pristine  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  wilderness. I know we don't have pristine wilderness in Britain but we do have some  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:33):**  wild spaces and some wild places. Now rewilding then sits somewhere in the middle of that  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:40):**  in between extensive farming and wilderness. That's rewilding is attempting to move in  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:48):**  one direction along that landscape continuum. Now in a spatial setting you might be thinking  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  about core areas of wild land. There may be sites of special scientific interest, there  
**[0:14:02-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:02):**  may be whole catchment landscape scale, core areas which we may be looking at in the future  
**[0:14:10-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:10):**  but then how they connect across the landscape is the key in that currently protected areas  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:18):**  in conservation management tend to be islands. They're green islands in a sea of urban and  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:26):**  agriculture and other land uses. We tend to set them aside, put a ring around them and  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:31):**  say that's for nature. Now the problem is with that is if we're talking about things  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:35):**  like issues like climate change and migration of species and reintroductions of formerly  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:42):**  native species is that if you put those, if you place them in that island context they've  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:48):**  got nowhere to go. They're isolated. So if we can create with landowner buy-in we can  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  create corridors, they're green corridors or blue corridors if you're thinking about  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:00):**  riparian corridors or coastal corridors which allow species to migrate north south up the  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:08):**  mountain, down the mountain in response to climate change and other drivers then that's  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:13):**  really where current conservation thinking is going. It's about connecting up and creating  
**[0:15:20-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:20):**  space for wildlife within our existing land use matrix, matrices which our abilities and  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:29):**  grazing and other types of farming are part of. So these corridors can be different types.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  They can be green corridors, riparian corridors, they can be stepping stones of smaller areas  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:41):**  of wilder land which species can jump from. They can be permeable corridors with more  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:46):**  extensive or less intensive land use, that sort of thing.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  And what did you think about the comment about agroforestry being sort of interchangeable  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:15:59):**  almost with the word rewilding?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah, I mean, to be honest I really don't know too much about agroforestry but I understand  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:09):**  the basic principle. But as I say, rewilding is a continuum and if you're moving from let's  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:15):**  say grazing land to agroforestry land, that's moving you further towards the wild end of  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:23):**  the spectrum. So it's, and certain species and natural processes will benefit. There's  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:28):**  been a lot of talk about how reforesting certain parts of the landscape, particularly let's  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:34):**  say gill sides or riparian woodlands, can help reduce flood peaks, attenuate flood peaks  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:43):**  and reduce the downstream flooding problem. So agroforestry in that context may have a  
**[0:16:48-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  benefit. But I think, and if you insert an extant species like beaver into that landscape,  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:16:56):**  you've got a conflict. Agroforestry is about producing, let's say it might be wood fuel,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:01):**  it might be wood for construction, whatever. And if you've got beaver in that landscape  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:06):**  then you're going to, a certain amount of loss is going to be implied. But then the  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:12):**  benefits of the beaver will accrue to one of the other primary roles of agroforestry  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:18):**  in terms of reducing flood peaks. So it's a juggling act in terms of establishing what  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:23):**  exactly you're doing the agroforestry for. Is it purely for timber production? Is it  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:29):**  wood fuel? Is it for its biodiversity benefits? Is it for its flood reduction benefits, in  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  which case the beaver fits in with that? Or is it for something else? Is it aesthetics?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:40):**  Is it a wood forest product?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:43):**  Joy Rose for Farmerama speaking to Steve Carver. If you're looking to further understand  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  the broad scope of projects that fall under the banner of rewilding, the Rewilding Britain  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:53):**  website is a great place to start.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  The aspect of this debate that we find most worrying is that farming is pitted against  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:02):**  rewilding often. Like the two can't work together. I'm glad to hear Steve saying that  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:08):**  this is not the case, that there are many different degrees of rewilding, and agroforestry  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:13):**  is one example. I guess where the sticking point comes is how much of your crop, be that  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:18):**  trees or berries or whatever, is it plausible to leave for the wild animals? So for example  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:25):**  with beavers, you could lose some trees to their gnawing, but on the plus side, they  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:31):**  build dams that prevent flooding for many years to come. So it's finding that balance.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:37):**  This is something that we don't know too much about, and we'd really like to hear more  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  farmers' opinions and thoughts on it. So please write us a quick comment on the Farmerama  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:44):**  radio Facebook page, or tweet us at Farmerama underscore underscore.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:50):**  It was also clear that rewilding projects have the most impact if conceived as part  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:18:55):**  of a collaboration across the landscape, between farmers in the valley and on the mountains,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:00):**  in the south and to the north, as wilderness habitats need to be semi-continuous so animals  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:06):**  can migrate around. Are you working in collaboration with any fellow farmers, or know of any projects  
**[0:19:13-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:13):**  like this? We really would love to hear more.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  Last summer we happened to be in Chagford on the same day as the Soil Association Future  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  Growers' apprentices on one of their Discovery Weekends. As part of the programme, these  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  apprentices do a paid internship at a nominated farm. They also have a series of weekend trips  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:52):**  as a whole group to share their learnings and see other inspiring growing projects around  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:19:56):**  the UK. It was clear everyone was working hard and learning a lot as they go.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:03):**  Hello, my name's Laura. I am currently working at a farm in East Sussex called Terry Gardens  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:09):**  Farm and I started there in February. My first time on a farm was actually picking grapes  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:13):**  in France, I just wanted to know how to make wine and through that I heard about woofing  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  and I woofed for a few years while I was initially applying for jobs in the NHS and I quickly  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  realised that the farm work was a lot more fun than anything I would be doing in the  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:27):**  NHS. And one of the woof farms that I worked for offered me a job just with a little stipend  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:32):**  and I stayed there for six months working after maybe six months of woofing. And then  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:37):**  I heard about the Future Growers Scheme through a chance meeting with Rachel Harries who coordinates  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:42):**  it and I applied for a six month traineeship on a farm in Dorset called Gold Hill which  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  practices no dig, grows vegetables on a no dig system. And I was there for six months  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:20:54):**  and I had a very interesting time supplying wholesale, I ran the market, we had a farm  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:00):**  shop and we also supplied a box scheme so it was really varied although very small scale.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:04):**  Well I definitely from today's visit to Chag Food I really liked how Ed was growing his  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  courgettes and his, well his kukubits through mypex and then at the end of the season leaving  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:18):**  the mypex down to help to clear the weeds ready for the carrots and parsnips the following  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:22):**  year. That just seemed so elegant and simple and I'd like to use that one day in the future.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:29):**  Hi I'm Saskia, I am currently an apprentice at Dalesford Organic. Jez, head grow there  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:37):**  asked me to go in as the seasonal picker with the strawberries so I moved in to the market  
**[0:21:43-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:43):**  garden 15 months ago to pick the strawberries and then stayed on after the picking had ended,  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:21:54):**  stayed on through the winter and then this year wanted to further my knowledge and find  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:00):**  out more about other farms and how to actually grow things and why we're doing the practices  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:07):**  that we're doing so understanding why or as a picker I'm there picking strawberries but  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:14):**  how did the strawberries get there I didn't know, I hadn't done the decrowning, the weeding,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:18):**  removing of runners, the kind of winter work that was yeah necessary to get the strawberries  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:26):**  so for me it's kind of opened my eyes to a lot of asking a lot of questions I didn't  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:30):**  kind of know where you know existed or just seeing things through.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:37):**  So I'm Rachel and I work for the Soil Association and I run the Future Growers Scheme and one  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:43):**  of the things that we have is a Google group for people who are within the scheme and we've  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:47):**  got about 50 people, 50 members of that Google group and it's a really good place because  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  it's quite a safe space for people to ask questions of other people who are learning  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:22:58):**  at the same time so people might be kind of less afraid of asking questions if they were  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:04):**  in a more experienced group so you get people asking questions about kind of you know what  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:07):**  sort of wellies are the best wellies to use, which are the wellies that are going to last  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  a whole season or you know people sharing resources like websites or books or podcasts  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:18):**  that they like or things about you know where do you get your plastic bags for packing your  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  salad packs so kind of all these different questions, all sorts of different questions  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:28):**  come up on it.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  If this has sparked your interest find out more from the Soil Association online.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:35):**  Before we end we're going to hear a project run by some listeners in Cambodia.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:40):**  Green Shoots is an NGO which supports the promotion of organic farming practices through  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:44):**  education programmes.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:47):**  Operations Director Manizie Jaffrey prepared this report about the work the organisation  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:51):**  has done over the last six years.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:54):**  Hi my name is Manizie Jaffrey, I'm the operations manager of Green Shoots Foundation, a small  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:23:59):**  NGO based in London which was set up in 2010 by our founder John-Mark Debrecon.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:06):**  Our aim was to work in microfinance projects but very quickly we realised that to make  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:13):**  long-term impact we needed to work by investing in skills of people and giving them the ability  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:20):**  to go forward themselves.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:23):**  So in 2012 we started a pilot project in Cambodia relating to agriculture skills.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:29):**  Our aim is to work with local partners, build their capacity and help them to fight poverty  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:34):**  and migration in this part of Cambodia.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:38):**  It's very close to the Thai border and young people will normally drop out of high school  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:43):**  and want to work in very high risk jobs.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:46):**  But what we wanted to do was to demonstrate to youth that a rural economy can be thriving  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:51):**  and help provide for their families.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  So in 2014 this pilot project was scaled up to become the agriculture skills and public  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:24:58):**  school project.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:00):**  The aim here is to set up vegetable gardens in 42 public schools, train 47 teachers and  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:07):**  about 8,000 to 12,000 students.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:10):**  We've dug new water ponds, improved water ponds where needed to help make these vegetable  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:17):**  gardens thriving and now our local partner will talk more about activities on the ground.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:23):**  My name is Ratna Un.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:25):**  I'm 31 years old from Samrong, Odaminche province, northwest Cambodia.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:31):**  This region was the last province where the fighting with the Khmer Rouge and Polpo stopped  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:37):**  around 1997, 10 years after the rest of the country.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:43):**  A lot of people who study at the university don't come back to this area as it's so poor.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:25:51):**  But I want to come back and help the future of our next generation, the children.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:00):**  The project that I work for called ESPAS, Agriculture Skills and Public Schools in partnership  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:09):**  with Greenshoot Foundation, the UK charity.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:15):**  We are working with 43 schools in the area and over 70% of the teachers in this region  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:24):**  are also farmers.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:26):**  Also most of schools start at 7 o'clock in the morning and finish around 11am so that  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:36):**  the teacher can go off to the farms.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:39):**  A lot of the children then have to go and help their parents too as they are also farmers.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:49):**  Teachers will train about how to make compost, organic pesticide, set up the vegetable garden,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:26:59):**  especially about water irrigation because this area does not have much rain.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  Right, and now I'm passing over to one of the teachers who got trained by ESPAS project.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:13):**  He will then express about his organic vegetable garden.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:16):**  Chum Reap Sua, hi, my name is Jay Sua Luan.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:21):**  I'm 31 years old.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:24):**  I'm a teacher in Danish Primary School located in Adom-en-Che province, northwest Cambodia.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:31):**  About a month after my training, we chose a plot of land in the school for the vegetable  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:39):**  garden.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:41):**  The teacher, students, and local community involved in digging, raising beds, building  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  fence, preparing compost, pesticide, and setting up the water irrigation.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:27:57):**  This is now our third cycle of growing vegetables.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:03):**  The previous two harvests were pretty good and improved.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:10):**  The first crop were morning glory and lettuce.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:14):**  Second crop were cucumber, yardlong beans, morning glory and lettuce.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:23):**  Now growing in the vegetable garden, we have eggplant, tomatoes, lettuce, and morning glory.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:37):**  We share these harvests with children and sell some vegetables for seed for the next  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:44):**  cycle.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:46):**  I expect that through this project, children, parents, and teachers are all interested and  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:54):**  involved in the vegetable garden.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:28:57):**  Some parents and children have started their own vegetable garden at home.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:01):**  With all of their help, it has made the vegetable garden a big success.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:10):**  Thanks, Maneezy and Co.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:12):**  It's always inspiring for us to hear from people on the ground in different countries.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:25):**  It's the time of year when we are again believing that the sun is coming back and we're starting  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:29):**  to think about all the ways the land is going to spring into life.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/19-farmerama#t=0:29:33):**  Thanks for joining us this month and we'll see you next time on Farmer Rama.

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:00):**  There was no plan when we started and there still isn't really a plan. I hadn't dreamt  
**[0:00:10-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:10):**  of making flour when we started.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:18):**  Welcome to Cereal from Farmerama. This is a bonus episode featuring an extended interview  
**[0:00:25-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:25):**  about Mungo's Wells Malt and Milling and their Swiss Army Flour Mill.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:35):**  I'm Angus McDowell. I'm the farmer at Mungo's Wells where we also have a little flour mill  
**[0:00:43-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:43):**  and a little maltings. I've been running the farm since 1984 and the mill has been  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:51):**  going now for about four and a half years.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:00:55):**  My name is Alison Campbell. I'm 53 and I came into the Mungo's Wells Malt and Milling when  
**[0:01:03-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:03):**  I was 48, 47. I knew nothing about it at all and I am now. I can malt and I can mill. I  
**[0:01:15-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:15):**  do the sales. I just love it. There's everything and it has allowed me to find my passion.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:23):**  I think Angus you should tell the story of the mill because you have a really good story.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:28):**  You tell it very well.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:31):**  We started malting. We got involved first in 2007 and then we found that we needed to  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:40):**  crush the malt for the little microbreweries because they don't all have their own mills.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:47):**  I was looking, we have a farm bruiser, would have done the job but it is the dustiest,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:53):**  dirtiest, most horrible piece of machinery and I didn't want it in here. I'm looking  
**[0:01:58-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:01:58):**  round and a flour miller said to me, have you seen the mobile Swiss army flour mills?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:10):**  I thought he was pulling my leg, I really did. However, we bought a mobile Swiss army  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:17):**  flour mill. The thought of the Swiss going off, stravaging round Europe, beating up  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:23):**  all their neighbours, yeah I suppose they wouldn't have been able to feed the troops  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:28):**  so they had to take their own flour mill with them perhaps but actually at the end of the  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:33):**  day I think in Switzerland you still do your national service for two years after you finish  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:41):**  at college or finish at school and I think you can do your milling apprenticeship while  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:48):**  you're in the army doing your national service and I think that's what these were built for.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:02:55):**  But this one, when it came here, we opened it up and you can see how dusty it is in there.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:02):**  It was clean, clean as a whistle. I don't believe it had ever had wheat in it. 30 years  
**[0:03:11-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:11):**  old. So I was very lucky. Once eventually we had the maltings sort of under control,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:21):**  it seemed a bit stupid to have a flour mill sitting and not make flour. So we started  
**[0:03:29-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:29):**  trying to make flour and there's me proud as punch and I take my first bag of flour  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:37):**  into a small bakery in Edinburgh and the owner took one look at it and said well I suppose  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:46):**  I could use that as a dusting flour. Now it meant nothing to me but it was only fit to  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:03:54):**  dust the table so the dough didn't stick to the table. So we had to go away and rebuild  
**[0:04:02-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:02):**  the flour mill. There were four of these Swiss army mills to start with. One went to Pakistan,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:11):**  one went to one of the big flour mills down south and the other chap was a farmer's son  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:18):**  as well but his older brother was running the farm. He did a milling training, went  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:26):**  away to be a miller and he bought one of these mills to set up on the farm at home. He's  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:34):**  been a great help to me right the way through. He told me why the mill wouldn't work as  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:43):**  it was, he told me what to do. He actually found the machine that we bought to put in  
**[0:04:50-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:50):**  except that it was completely rotten. We rebuilt it here on the farm because I still didn't  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:04:59):**  know if it would work once we put this machine in. We spent six or nine months, all the spare  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:06):**  moments building more bits and pieces and put this all together and then to everybody's  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:15):**  amazement I think suddenly we were making saleable flour. And since then he has tweaked  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:22):**  it and it's run on electricity, gravity and suction and a lot of make do and mend which  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:30):**  is even better because he's not spending fortunes. So he's reusing, he's regenerating  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:37):**  old bits of machinery, he's producing something that works and as it turns out it makes really  
**[0:05:44-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:44):**  good bread as well. It was 30 years old before I bought it but we think that it was to all  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:05:53):**  intents and purposes new, hadn't really been used. Four or five years after we've started  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:01):**  it's now got 5000 hours on the clock. And that's building up as well, it does a bit  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:08):**  more every year from what it did the year before. Somewhere about six tonnes a week  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:13):**  at the moment which is quite a lot of loaves of bread. It goes way up into the roof, we'll  
**[0:06:18-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:18):**  go upstairs and have a wee look at the separators. All this was actually inside the trailer.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:34):**  All the green bits. All the green bits was inside the mobile trailer and Angus in his  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:40):**  genius has tweaked it shall we say, just a bit. Got to look after the mill and it becomes  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:49):**  like a pet in a certain way. You care for it and you look after it and you give it respect  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:06:57):**  that it's due which you must do because it's a dangerous machine if used incorrectly and  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:05):**  you just have to be aware of what it can do. But when used correctly it's so fulfilling.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:12):**  It's a great story this grown on the farm, milled on the farm. To start with it was all  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:19):**  grain of our own production and I said oh we'll only use what we grow ourselves and  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:25):**  then we began to get too successful, too clever for our own good and now we are buying in,  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:32):**  we have a field rented from a neighbour. I'm talking to other organic farmers about getting  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:40):**  them to grow crop for us in Scotland. We can grow more on the conventional part of the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:46):**  farm. We are changing the rotation to be able to grow enough wheat for the mill but on the  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:07:55):**  organic part it's a longer process. You've got to feed the ground in the previous year  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:02):**  to build the nitrogen in the ground to make the protein to get good enough quality wheat.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:08):**  How common is it then to have a mill on a farm like this where you're milling your own  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:15):**  grain? I don't think anyone else does in Scotland. I don't know anyone else who's milling on  
**[0:08:21-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:21):**  the farm. Do you think this could be a model for other farms? Oh no, no, it's dreadful,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:30):**  it's terribly hard work. Well, no, seeing it slightly more seriously. If you were to  
**[0:08:37-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:37):**  try to set that up from scratch, new stuff, it would cost best part of a million. Not  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:47):**  because the machinery, the actual mill unit separators, so on, cost as much but you pay  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:08:55):**  as much again to plumb it all together, to pipe it up, to fit it in so that before it'll  
**[0:09:03-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:03):**  work, electrics and everything as well. It is simply not viable to start a mill on this  
**[0:09:13-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:13):**  sort of scale. There's no economy of scale when you start working at this sort of rate.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:28):**  What we have is what I would call a changeover flour, which is we can't, it's not one particular  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:34):**  whole flour, it's a little bit perhaps of strong bread and a little bit of plain flour  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:38):**  when I change on the mill, I have a flush through. The flour is of perfectly good quality,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:44):**  however it can't be sold as a specific type. So what we've investigated is how can we  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:51):**  benefit the community, which group is going to be able to use this? And we give this flour  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:09:57):**  to community groups, to local churches, we take sacks into our local high school in North  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:10:04):**  Berwick, they use it, lots of different community welfare groups, you know, and the most valuable  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:10:11):**  commodity we have is our time and I think it's best served along with fabulous bread,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-mungoswells-malt-and-milling#t=0:10:17):**  so it's wonderfully, it's really good.

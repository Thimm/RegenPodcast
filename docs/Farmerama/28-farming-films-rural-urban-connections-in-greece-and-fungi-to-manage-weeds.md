**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:00:38):**  Sabina Helmann is a filmmaker with a longstanding interest in food.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:00:56):**  Her first documentary explored the introduction of GM crops in northeast Germany.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:02):**  Since then, she's been involved with several other food and farming related projects, both

**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:12):**  and advocacy.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:14):**  She told us about her work with small scale farmers in Malawi.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:18):**  I'm coming from a background as a filmmaker, and I've been to different places where I've  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:23):**  dived into community and tried to capture everyone.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:27):**  So that was my approach always, and I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:29):**  I also really thought a lot about the ethics of it.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:32):**  And I was always a bit uncomfortable.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:34):**  I always felt I'm taking something from people without giving enough back or really making  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:40):**  sure they know the magnitude of giving me all their information, their emotions and  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:44):**  so on.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:45):**  In 2013, two former colleagues approached me and asked me, Sabine, we're doing another  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:51):**  project in Malawi.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:53):**  Would you like to come along?  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:54):**  But not as a filmmaker, but actually training people to make their own films.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:01:58):**  And I was like, oh, I have no idea how to do that.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:03):**  But my one colleague said, well, there's this really great tool process called Participatory  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:09):**  Video and maybe you can do it.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:11):**  There's a course actually coming up in Oxford, an amazing course.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:15):**  So went to the course.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:17):**  Two weeks later, off to Malawi.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:18):**  The project itself was an agricultural project, which was for me really interesting.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:23):**  It was basically trying to adapt permaculture principles and figuring out how this can be  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:29):**  done in the Malawian context, in a peasant farming context where people are absolutely  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:35):**  dependent on soil quality, water rainfall patterns, which are disastrous in the last  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:41):**  years, like super changing climate.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:44):**  And people are basically dependent on a good crop.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:47):**  If the crops fail, people are suffering from hunger.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:51):**  Partly the issue is that many years ago, clever white people came and told them to grow maize,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:02:58):**  which is a water dependent crop, does well when the rain pattern is doing its job right,  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:03):**  but in recent years has caused a lot of trouble.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:06):**  Partly also because the soils have eroded.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:08):**  People grow the maize and rows that often means that the water just runs off and then  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:14):**  it's getting hot again and the maize dries up.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:18):**  Permaculture principles also means people were not just told, oh, this is how you do  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:23):**  it.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:24):**  They had field workers to come to Kusamala, which is a really nice permaculture center  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:29):**  based in Lilongwe.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:31):**  And they were trained up by local staff and were shown the techniques and they had to  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:36):**  do them.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:37):**  They had to dig up soil and looked at the soil and what's it composed of.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:41):**  They learned about the chemistry and what makes good soil and whatnot.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:44):**  They learned how to make a compost pile.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:46):**  They had to do one.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:48):**  They saw the different demonstrations that were there and they had to go through the  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:53):**  steps so that they really understand, they can go back to the community and really show.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:03:56):**  So that was part of the whole project where the video comes in is that we wanted to look  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:02):**  at once we give people the tools to film themselves, first we wanted to find out what's the general  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:08):**  situation on the ground.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:10):**  So we made different workshops and just wanted to make films about what they felt was important  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:14):**  to them.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:16):**  So the second phase is the monitoring evaluation phase where we really wanted to see has it  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:22):**  worked, what didn't work, what issues came up and through doing it by giving people the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:27):**  tools to express themselves and discuss in a group and you know not really just sending  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:33):**  them a questionnaire out where they just have to tick boxes whether how many grams of rice  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:37):**  they harvested or maize.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:39):**  But actually making a story you actually find out and it was amazing to see.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:46):**  Already the first phase we called it baseline phase was really incredible because lots of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:52):**  stories were done about something that we never anticipated.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:04:55):**  For example when we started to train farmers to use mulching, so using the old maize stalks,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:02):**  old crop residues to cover the fields, they got into trouble because it is a cultural  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:08):**  habit often by the kids in town that go off burn the field to hunt maize.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:13):**  So obviously when your field is burned and you did all this work to try to do something  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:18):**  slightly innovative and new you kind of lose hope.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:21):**  So one of the stories was about that and we never knew that this was actually something  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:26):**  we would encounter as a problem.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:29):**  Another issue was with the cheeky vendors that come in and try to sell, buy the maize  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:35):**  from families to a really shorty price.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:39):**  So basically ripping them off.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:40):**  So they made a film about it and how you can avoid these cheeky vendors coming in and you  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:45):**  know in the end the family could go hungry because they sold too much maize for too little  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:49):**  money.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:51):**  All these things that we never really knew about and anticipated came through and we  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:05:55):**  had to deal with them right there and then and figure out solutions while the project

**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:14:09):**  in other cases in other countries.

**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:14:21):**  and the urban with community supported agriculture which has several forms in other countries  
**[0:14:29-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:14:29):**  and has a long story but it's not yet expanded as an idea in Greece.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:14:40):**  So I think that this might work because within this new model of community supported agriculture,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:14:48):**  you have to have trust.

**[0:15:05-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:15:05):**  other member groups, I think you can actually establish the model and actually reply to

**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:15:29):**  don't have a former experience have their historical background because in Greece, we  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:15:36):**  didn't have this heavy industrialization that other countries had in Europe.

**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:15:47):**  from our extended family had a small piece of land that has been providing us with fresh

**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:16:32):**  The urban is not trusting the rural.

**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:16:39):**  We do not trust farmers due to all these food scandals and all this discussion about how

**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:16:56):**  amongst each other between the rural and the urban.

**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:17:09):**  You can hear more of this interview with Maria on our Soundcloud page or farmerama.co where

**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:17:54):**  What started as a love of grass soon became a love of vegetables and then grew into a

**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:01):**  He actually spoke to us about golf courses but as you will hear, what he has to say is  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:07):**  of great relevance to farmers as well.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:11):**  He told us how it's possible to manage weeds simply by working with microbial balance in  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:17):**  the soil.

**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:27):**  growing grass and they like to grow certain species of grass that are best for creating  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:32):**  a smooth and fine playing surface for putting on those greens.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:37):**  And there of course there are many different species of grass that they can use for that  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:41):**  purpose.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:42):**  And they much prefer to use more perennial which means grasses that live year after year  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:47):**  after year, not an annual grass that just grows and dies once in one year.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:54):**  It lives through the winter and just starts to regrow again in the spring.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:18:57):**  So they prefer growing more of these perennial grasses because they are better quality, they  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:02):**  have finer leaves and they create a better playing surface.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:06):**  But they do have some problems with weeds, other grasses that come into those golf greens,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:11):**  particularly some of these annual grasses which don't create as a good finer playing  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:19):**  surface.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:20):**  So there's a particular grass weed that they struggle with, one called Poa annua, it's  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:26):**  an annual grass often called winter grass or meadow grass, annual meadow grass.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:30):**  And this grass can start to grow in the greens and it's not as favourable.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:34):**  And it's quite difficult for golf groundskeepers to manage because they can't use herbicides  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:42):**  to spray it out like they maybe other farmers or other situations where you can use herbicides  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:49):**  which are very specific in their mode of action, very selective in their mode of action.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:54):**  They're both grasses so they're both very similar, one's just perennial, one's annual.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:19:58):**  So you can't, if the groundskeeper did use a herbicide in that instance it would also  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:03):**  affect the health of his perennial one that he wants.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:07):**  So it's a real problem for them and what we've found that we can do is actually apply fungal  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:14):**  inoculants, so apply some beneficial microorganisms to the soil, a particular group called fungi,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:19):**  and also apply some fungal foods, some food sources to feed that organism.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:23):**  And simply by inoculating or applying this particular microorganism into these golf greens  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:30):**  we make the soil, we make those golf greens more fungal dominated, they have a dominance  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:36):**  of fungi.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:37):**  And what that actually does is change the soil, as I mentioned those examples of biology  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:43):**  changing the soil properties, well those fungi start to change the soil cycling of nutrients,  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:49):**  the particular nutrients they cycle, they're improving the structure of the soil, those  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:52):**  physical aspects.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:20:54):**  And they make the soil more favourable for those later, those perennial grasses that  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:00):**  they're trying to encourage.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:02):**  And actually that annual grass doesn't like that environment anymore, it struggles, it  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:07):**  adapted in an environment that didn't have so much fungi, it adapted, it thrives in a  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:12):**  more bacterial dominated soil, another microorganism that exists in soils.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:17):**  It thrives in a bacterial dominated soil and the, because it's annual and the perennial  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:22):**  grass thrives in a more fungal dominated soil.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:25):**  So as we shift that succession and shift the fungal dominance of the soil we simply create  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:21:30):**  the conditions that's favourable for one grass and it then grows with more vigour and it

**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:23:37):**  physics is important, let's look at that, look at the structural properties, the aeration

**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:23:56):**  but then also put the plant into that picture, so living plants, living plant roots, plants  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:24:01):**  that are photosynthesizing, capturing sunlight, breathing in carbon dioxide and also playing

**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/28-films-for-the-farming-movement-rural-urban-connections-in-greece-and-fungi-to-manage-weeds#t=0:25:52):**  very badly understood and that we really needed a easily to understand movement building tool

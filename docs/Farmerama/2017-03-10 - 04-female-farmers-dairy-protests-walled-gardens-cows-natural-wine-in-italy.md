## 04: Female farmers, dairy protests, walled gardens, cows & natural wine in Italy  
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Go on! Go on then! Go on girls!  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Farmerama and stories from smaller scale farms in the UK and beyond.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:19):**  We bring you a collection of anecdotes and experiments from the front line of farming.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:24):**  We're out in the field digging out what's really going on.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:27):**  Today we're at Hockham Farm in East Sussex to record the show,  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:31):**  which is actually Nigel's family's farm.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  So we're starting gathered around the agar while Nigel's shepherdess mum Monica cooks up some of the sheep  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:39):**  which is reared here on the farm.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:41):**  But today we have reports from all over the place, Belgium, Northern Ireland, Italy, as well as closer to home.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:49):**  And first we're speaking to some female farmers from even further afield.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:53):**  Kenya, Tanzania and Burkina Faso.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:00:57):**  So Lucy and Rosaline both have successful farms in Kenya.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:01):**  Lucy, she has a mixed farm with chickens, cattle and horticulture and Rosaline actually grows herbs for tea.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:08):**  Both were really keen to hear from farmers in the UK, particularly for help with marketing and export opportunities.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:14):**  But first here you're going to hear them talking a little about male-female dynamics in African farming while in Burkina Faso.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  And farming, well in particular in Kenya.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:52):**  They are doing it as a business.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:01:54):**  The only challenge we have with women taking part in the same is that land is given from the patriarchal perspective.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:00):**  That is, it's given to, if a man has ten children and five are daughters, the others are sons,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  the five are sons, the five will be given land.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:11):**  And the land is given to the family.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:13):**  So it's a very, very difficult situation.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  And the land is given to the family.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:17):**  The five are daughters, the others are sons, the five are sons, the five will be given land, but it will not be given to the daughters.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  Although there is a new constitution in our country, it's trying to bring the issue of equity, but still the boy child owns the land.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  So it will be difficult for women to go into it as a business.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:37):**  But those who have tried are very successful.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  We also have groups of women joining hands and doing farming as groups, we call them in our language, charmers.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:49):**  And the women have been able to grow crops extensively and even export.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:02:55):**  But mainly the subsistence farming is still done in the villages by women and children.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:07):**  As of course the children provide primary labor.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:11):**  When it comes to farming as a business, mainly men are the ones who are serious.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:17):**  And at times it's also done as families.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:19):**  That's why we in the Slow Food Youth Network, we are trying to get our students and pupils to learn about foods, learn about growing crops, small gardens,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:31):**  and at least spread the word across the board so that those children can now pass the information to their parents back at home.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  And then we'll grow good food, fair food, healthy food, and we'll have a healthy nation.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:47):**  One lady I was particularly inspired by was Gladys from Tanzania.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  She's a lawyer who works with the Maasai tribes to fight for pastoralist rights.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:03:55):**  There's actually much talk between female farmers about how female empowerment will only happen if men are part of that conversation,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:04):**  and if they recognize the importance of the shift as well as women.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  When I was mentoring Maasai girls, I learned that if we keep advocating for gender equality and then educating women and pressuring women,  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:21):**  it's like putting an attitude against the other side because after all, what are we advocating for?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:26):**  Why do we want to empower women? From what?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  So it's only good that we involve men in this.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:32):**  We need men in this because who else empowers women?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:36):**  So it's a lot of work.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:39):**  It's tough because obviously men in the African context own and they are the dominant.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:46):**  So it's going to be tough, but I know there's a way that men can help us because it's not a fight.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:04:52):**  It's not a negative attitude we want to pressure on men, but we want them to understand that women are also human.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:00):**  They have roles. They have duties. Also do men.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:03):**  And we can as well just call work and this thing of abuse should go away.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:13):**  And so as to build a community, we need cooperation. We need to help each other in the economy.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:18):**  We need to help each other in building our families. That's the only way you can build a good future.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:24):**  So far as I came here because I used to think things are tough where I come from,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:28):**  but then having heard about other people and their situations, I realized that everything is possible.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:35):**  And I also realized that the power is not with the old or the children, but the youth have the ability to change.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:43):**  And finally, positive thinking from the lovely Clements Aoudrago.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:48):**  Oh, I didn't say that right. Sorry.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  Who works with a group of female growers to sell their produce in Burkina Faso.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:05:55):**  This is very important to include women because in our society, the men have the power.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:05):**  And the men don't want to share this power with women.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:11):**  Men can help women to be courageous to attend the objective.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:21):**  The way is so far, but together we can arrive.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:27):**  Mind you, your mum was cooking here, but where is she?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:31):**  We could do with her input here.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:32):**  Oh yeah, mum. Mother?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  Monica?  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  Mum?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:37):**  I'm not sure if you're ever referred to as this because I know this isn't what you are or only what you are,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:43):**  but being a farmer's wife, how does that make you feel?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:48):**  Yeah, that's fine. I mean, I guess that's what I am.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:54):**  It's like partners really. It's a farming partnership.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:06:59):**  I do find it kind of annoying when in some cases it's quite a male dominated occupation.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:08):**  Do you think the tables are turning, mother?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  Do you think there are more female farmers are getting their recognition?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  I think the attitude towards the fact that females do pay a plant is becoming more acceptable.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:26):**  But there's still a certain number of kind of old, what can you say?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:33):**  Old school, old garlands.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:35):**  Yeah, old school who tend to just want to talk to the males about it  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  and they don't think that females got anything that they could contribute.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:46):**  Maybe there's more attention being brought to it these days really.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:07:51):**  In the past it's been unusual, but now I think it's more acceptable that it is kind of teamwork to a certain extent  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:00):**  and that females can play just as important a part as the males really.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:07):**  I don't know.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah, well you're pretty, I mean on the sheep side of things, that you've more or less won the sheep enterprise.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:15):**  We tend to, to a certain extent, I tend to deal with the sheep and Fred tends to deal with the cattle.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:21):**  You also share responsibilities as well.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:23):**  We do.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:24):**  You work as a team.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  We're waiting for the gates to come in and I think they've maybe burst through the gates  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:38):**  and obviously the calves got left behind and the cows went into the machine shed  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:42):**  where they shouldn't really go and as a result there's a bit of chaos.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:46):**  Oi!  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:47):**  Quite well done, wasn't it?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:49):**  Good old ballerina.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:52):**  Abby, get her out the back.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:54):**  I don't know.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:55):**  No, no, no, not that way.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:57):**  Go on, that one.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:08:58):**  Go on, that one fella. Go on.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:03):**  Go on.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:04):**  Go on then.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:18):**  If you heard last week's show, you'll know that we left Nigel in Milan after the We Feed the Planet event.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  He spent quite a bit of time in Europe over the last couple of months, but he has been busy.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:30):**  You were in Belgium, Nigel.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:33):**  Yes, that's right.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:35):**  I was in... I travelled to Brussels on the 7th of September to join a gathering of over 5,000 protesting farmers.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:45):**  I think there was somewhere in the region of 2,000 tractors.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:48):**  It was quite a sight.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  I'm here in Schumann Roundabout in Brussels in front of the European Commission,  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:55):**  surrounded by protesting farmers.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  Some 5,000 angry dairy farmers, livestock farmers, all here protesting against the low prices they are receiving.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  Looks to be a helicopter up ahead as well. It's all happening.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:10):**  I'm Jeanne-Jves Savigny. I'm a farmer and a member of the European Coordination Via Campesina,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  which is a broad movement of farmers all over Europe fighting for, especially for milk today.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:21):**  The price is very low.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  A few years ago we decided to open the markets and to be... to be... to liberalise the sector.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  And so now the prices are very, very down.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:32):**  And the thing is that for us it was bound to happen. It's normal. It's normal in this kind of market.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:39):**  So we want real solutions so that we quit this kind of ideology that the market must solve it all  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:46):**  and that we find solutions to regulate the sector.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:51):**  We defend the idea to increase or to decrease the production according to the market.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:10:58):**  That's not a real quota.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:00):**  According to the market, if the market needs milk, we produce more.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:06):**  If the market needs less milk, we produce less.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:11):**  That's very simple. And for us it's the only solution.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  We're here to manifest against the laws that have been imposed on us  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:18):**  and the conditions for the farmers because it's not viable.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:21):**  The farmers are killing themselves. The costs are higher than what they get.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:25):**  So that's normal. Nobody can survive that. It's not doable.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:30):**  We are trying here for over... I'm saying six years, but it's even more to make things move.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:36):**  But it doesn't work. People don't react and it's always waiting until it's too late to make something change.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:41):**  How many farmers do have to die to say it like that before something happens?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:46):**  Michael Oakes, Farming in the West Midlands, and I'm Vice Chairman of the National Dairy Board for the NFU.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:50):**  It's sheer frustration, actually. Whether you're in the dairy sector or other sectors,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:54):**  many of us are working for nothing.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:11:57):**  We actually want country of origin labelling so that we can identify that things are British  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:01):**  and consumers can actually support British agriculture and British products  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:04):**  because they get the choice at the retailer.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:07):**  On top of that, the single farm payment exists and at this moment we desperately need it.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:12):**  And actually any kind of delay in the payments of that will actually push dairy farmers under.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:17):**  I was a bit worried because there's a big water cannon over there.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:21):**  A big water cannon? So there's this line of police here and they've got a huge machine with big...  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:26):**  Well, they don't like guns, but I guess they're water cannons.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:29):**  We know very well this kind of machine.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:31):**  Oh really? In France you farmers, you like to protest?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:35):**  It's not a surprise.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:37):**  So could they pay you more money, do you think?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:40):**  Are they being greedy? Are they taking all the money?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:43):**  Yes, of course they can pay more, but actually, I say to you before,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:49):**  there is too much milk on the market.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  Too much supply.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  And the market is the result of the production and the consumption.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:12:58):**  If you have too much production for the consumption, the price is decreasing.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  That's very simple.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:05):**  James and myself have come from Northern Ireland, flew out this morning  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:09):**  and we're here to support our fellow farmers in this crisis time.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:12):**  And what is the solution to this crisis?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  Intervention needs to be reduced and needs to be risen,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:20):**  so we can still stay in business.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:22):**  And are you guys dairy farmers?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:24):**  Yes, we're dairy farmers.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  It's hurting us at home too.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:28):**  So how much longer can you sustain these really low prices?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:32):**  End of the spring and that'll finish us.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:35):**  So it needs to be sorted out immediately.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  So people as well as citizens are on our side, but the politicians, they don't know.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  Hogan doesn't know what he should do.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:51):**  The politicians should know that they should have a policy with an aim,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:13:56):**  because their current policy has no aim, it has no reason.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:00):**  And if all the farmers are destroyed, then it's not like the costs are going to go down,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:05):**  but the costs are going to go up, because our farms are going to belong to the banks.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:11):**  And this is not what we want.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:13):**  We need dairy farmers, we don't need banks.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:16):**  And so you think there's in Holland, there are a lot of young farmers, people going into farming?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:21):**  Yeah, there are lots of young people that want to be a farmer,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:26):**  but with these prices that we have now and with the costs that they have,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:32):**  they are thinking, should we do that for the future or not?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:37):**  So it's a bit of a struggle.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:43):**  This sounds like it was really quite a big deal.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:46):**  Brussels had lots of coverage, there were lots of people there.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:49):**  It sounds like there was a big police presence.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:52):**  But this seems like something which in the UK I'm not that familiar with,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:14:58):**  as somebody who's not in the farming community.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  Would you say that's fair? Is there a different kind of feel?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:05):**  Yeah, well absolutely. I think in the UK, farmers are definitely more in the background,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  they're not so vocal in terms of protesting.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:15):**  This time, things are getting really serious,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:18):**  and there were quite a number of UK farmers who actually travelled out with me to protest.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:25):**  A lot of them, to be honest, were dairy farmers,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  because those are the guys that are really up against it at the moment.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:32):**  They're trying to highlight the fact that the prices they are receiving are unsustainable  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  and something has to change.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:38):**  It's a ticking time bomb. Unless prices improve, these farmers are going to go out of business.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:43):**  UK farmers will be protesting more unless things turn around.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:48):**  So what can we do to help?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:50):**  I think it's important, if you can support your local farmer,  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:15:54):**  so farmers that have set up farm shops, if you can visit your local farm shop  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:02):**  and buy meat and milk directly from those farms, that's great.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:07):**  I guess I just want to say there that obviously I'm not experienced in this at all,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:13):**  but I find it frustrating that the EU does have to intervene.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:21):**  That maybe also another solution is that we need to look for,  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:25):**  and I keep saying this kind of thing, but alternative business models that work  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:29):**  so that the farmer is actually getting paid fairly just from the get-go.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah, it's a tricky one to fix.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  Alternative business models are great, but it's quite niche.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:41):**  The vast majority of people are still buying their milk from supermarkets,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:45):**  and supermarkets are the ones that are selling it as a lost leader.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:49):**  Basically people see it as a commodity, and farmers are selling it as a commodity.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:16:56):**  I think it's going to take an awful lot of change to improve the situation.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:03):**  It's a shame. There are real examples, shining beacons, of dairy producers actually making money.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:11):**  There's not many of them. There's the likes of raw milk as an example,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:16):**  but I don't think that's a solution for all dairy farmers suddenly to just start producing raw milk.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  But there is certainly scope for farmers to collaborate and maybe try and process their own milk,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:30):**  cooperate, etc.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  And that could be a way of making more money, making it more sustainable.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  Now onto a report from friend of the show, Ben Ruskin.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:02):**  He works at the Soil Association, and you may have heard him on our first ever episode.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:06):**  He was an early supporter.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:08):**  And here he's speaking to David Love Cameron at his kitchen garden in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:13):**  So I'm here in Helen's Bay Wool Garden. How did you end up here, David?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:18):**  Well, I won a scholarship to work with Raymond Blanc on a new heritage vegetable garden  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:24):**  in Le Manoir Quat Saison in Oxfordshire.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:28):**  And that was all about showcasing garden organics heritage seed collection.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:32):**  And so there'd been quite a lot of publicity around that.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:35):**  And the owner of the garden here had read some of it.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:38):**  And when I came back home to Northern Ireland, he asked me to get involved  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  and help him redevelop this lovely old Victorian wall garden.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:46):**  Short term plans really are to get the weeds under control and prepare the soil  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:52):**  to take a really wide range of kitchen garden crops.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:18:57):**  We've got these two polytunnels that we're growing winter salads in.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:01):**  And we started to build relationships with local chefs from good restaurants.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:06):**  So they're really keen to get a good, high quality, fresh local product  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:11):**  that they can put on their menus.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:13):**  And we'll work with them from there.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:17):**  Long term, once we've established a really credible kitchen garden here,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:21):**  we want to run classes.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:23):**  We'd love to get mental health charities involved.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:27):**  We'll run classes for ladies who lunch as well.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:30):**  But then we could have a cafe and lovely high quality stores or supplies store.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  That kind of thing. So that's the vision.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:40):**  So almost like a food hub in the area.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:44):**  Yeah, definitely. We're very close to Belfast here.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:48):**  We've got a great demographic in the local area.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:51):**  So we think there is a niche in the market for that kind of thing here in Belfast.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:56):**  And as you can see, it's just an amazing setting.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:19:58):**  We're surrounded by mature trees and lovely woodland.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:02):**  And we're just a mile or so from the shore.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:05):**  So, yeah, we think Belfast is ready for it.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:10):**  So what do you think your main challenges with the garden are going to be?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:14):**  Well, I mean, the immediate challenge is dealing with the weed problem that we've had here.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:19):**  The garden's been cleared several times already.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:22):**  But, you know, as you can see, we've got lots of problems with cooked grass and docks and so on.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  And so, you know, we're just trying to find a strategy to deal with that at the moment.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:33):**  So over the next few weeks, we might get some goats in.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  And so I think they can do a pretty good job of clearing weeds.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:40):**  And then after that, we'll probably just put it down to black plastic and then roll that back, cultivate the ground,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:48):**  get it ready for spring and we'll just bring sections of the garden into production as we go along.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:54):**  And, you know, it's just really me and the owner here at the moment.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:20:58):**  And so there's a lot for us to do.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:00):**  And part of our sort of strategy will be to run a volunteer program.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:05):**  So giving local people who are interested in horticulture and horticulture students the chance to come along  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:13):**  and work in this kind of unique setting in Belfast.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:16):**  Fantastic. I noticed you got a couple of really lovely old mature, slightly outgrown style apple trees down there.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah, yeah, they're really beautiful. They're quite kind of craggy and ragged.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:29):**  But the pear is actually quite productive and the pears are really lovely and almost fizzy at the moment.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:36):**  But yeah, the apples, I'm not quite sure what the varieties are.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:40):**  You know, maybe someone will come along and tell us.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:43):**  But yeah, we'll whip those into shape, hopefully, and plant lots more fruit along the walls.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:48):**  And we may even have like a nut walk, something like that.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:53):**  If you want to find out more about the walled garden at Hillens Bay in Bangor County down,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:21:58):**  you can check out our Facebook page for more details.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:01):**  We have been very excited that following our request for you to contribute some of your own audio to the show,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:07):**  we've already received some submissions.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:10):**  In fact, we've been so impressed that we've decided to release some of these as short stories on the podcast feed.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:18):**  The first of these is from Camilla Williamson, who spent some time at Castello de Portentino, a small scale vineyard in Tuscany.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  So romantic.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:29):**  A full report is on the feed, but here's a taste of an introduction to their natural approach to wine production.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:45):**  My name is Charlotte Horton.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:47):**  I am English, but I've been living initially for 26 years  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:54):**  and discovered that I had an extraordinary passion for winemaking.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:22:59):**  I learned winemaking off the local people 25 years ago,  
**[0:23:03-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:03):**  and that experience has been informing the way that I make wine and I treat the vines ever since then.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:14):**  It's a technique that's based on observation and really using very, very natural treatment of the vines  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  and responding to the plants and the particular microclimate that we have.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:30):**  We have found a whole series of Etruscan winemaking stones down the valley,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:36):**  which attest to probably a continuous tradition of winemaking for about 3,000 years.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:44):**  So I'm very proud to be continuing that extremely important tradition.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:49):**  The Castello di Potentino has a very unique microclimate.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:23:53):**  We are in a valley under one of the highest mountains in Tuscany that used to be a volcano.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:00):**  So we have mixed volcanic soil.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  We have a lot of aquifers under the soil, and we have extreme changes in temperature,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:09):**  what they call diurnal temperature, so from day to night.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:14):**  So we have very hot, dry air coming in from the coast during the day,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:18):**  very cold air coming off the mountain at night.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  These are perfect conditions for the growth of fruit, and in fact this valley,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:26):**  which is known as the golden basin in the area, the Concadoro, is very fertile and full of fruit trees,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:34):**  olive trees, cherry trees, apple, pear, all sorts of things, and obviously, vine.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:42):**  We have three different varieties of grape in our vineyard.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:47):**  All three varieties are extremely sensitive to their particular environments.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:24:54):**  So they have a particular quality or a characteristic, but they very much reflect or mirror the microclimate,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:02):**  or what they call in France the terroir of where they are.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:08):**  So I think plants definitely have an intelligence.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:12):**  Humans have a different type of intelligence and not able to recognize the intelligence of plants, sadly.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:20):**  So plants often get quite badly treated.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:24):**  And what I'm interested in is providing a very good situation for the plants,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:33):**  because they will thrive and they will produce something that is natural, it's sustainable.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:41):**  And so that's also very important in how you consider what you're planting and where,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  is the sustainability, not only in the sustainability of the plant's life,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:54):**  but also in the sustainability of the taste.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:25:57):**  I believe that you can actually taste in wines or food when they are produced from plants  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:04):**  that are happy and sustainable in their own environment.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:09):**  So we don't add a lot of chemicals to the wine, we don't add a lot of fertilizers to the soil, and we don't irrigate.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:18):**  These are things that will become less sustainable.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:22):**  The use of pesticides and fungicides and treatments for plants in order to produce food or wine is becoming a really problematic issue.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:34):**  I think that people and plants should be where they can survive without making too much of an effort.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:26:49):**  So thanks for joining us this week, from the farm, with Joe, Abby and Monica, my mother, and everyone.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:00):**  I hope we haven't been recording as you've been cooking us dinner. I hope we haven't got in the way too much.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:06):**  No, no, no problem. It's all good. It's interesting actually.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:11):**  My kitchen table is being used for a lot of things, but this is the first time it's being used as a recording studio.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:17):**  How much is this room an important part of the running of the farm?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:22):**  Yeah, it's the central part of the farm.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:25):**  It's the centre of your universe, isn't it?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:28):**  It all happens in the kitchen.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:32):**  So true. I thought that.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:42):**  Farmarama is released on the third Sunday of the month, but keep an eye out for the odd special edition like the Potentino report.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  You can find us as Farmarama Radio on Facebook, and we're on Instagram, and we're on Twitter as well.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/04-farmerama#t=0:27:59):**  Goodbye. Goodbye. Have fun.

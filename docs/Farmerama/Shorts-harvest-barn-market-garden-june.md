**[0:00:00-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:00):**  Good evening everyone, it's the 25th of June 2018. The sound you can hear in the background  is a impact sprayer, an irrigation unit that I've just got. Finally I've got a hose with  a wand so I can water in the polytunnel and out in the field without going backwards and  
**[0:00:30-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:30):**  forwards with two watering cans which is what I was doing before. It's about 20 metres from  the tap to the start of the field and then another about 50 metres to the end of the  plot. So that should save a lot of time. I'm just experimenting with the sprinkler. This  
**[0:00:48-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:48):**  is a part circle sprinkler, I've never had one before so I'm just trying to work out  how it works and adjust it. At the moment it seems to be spraying quite well but only  really watering the end point of the jet and not the bit in between the end point and the  
**[0:01:08-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:08):**  actual sprayer, the tripod that it's mounted on. So I guess I have to keep moving it or  turning the water up and down. So I haven't recorded anything for a while, it's been very  busy. I've been continuing to be driving back and forth between Norwich and Peterborough  
**[0:01:30-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:30):**  and Peterborough and London and everything has been growing like crazy on the farm. There's  been lots of ups and downs. I've had a few moments where I felt like I might pack it  in, just too much stress and too many challenges and not feeling entirely happy in this location  
**[0:01:50-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:50):**  and that's partly to do with not feeling totally happy on the farm and partly to do with the  area and not knowing anybody and farming is quite a lonely business. So I feel that and  I haven't really found any markets to sell my produce so that feels like a big challenge  
**[0:02:15-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:15):**  that I've yet to get to grips with just because I'm too busy on the actual farm to be driving  around visiting places. So that's a bit demoralising not having anyone to sell to apart from the  shop. We're in the process of working out our prices. Lots of things are growing really  
**[0:02:36-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:36):**  well and with the hot weather it's really nice to be outside and harvesting vegetables.  At the moment I'm harvesting onions, spring onions, lots of salad, radish, cabbages, coriander,  peas and very soon I should have some courgettes. Sweetcorn is about a foot high. There's quite  
**[0:03:05-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:05):**  a lot of sweet peas but they're not really selling in the shop so I'd like to be selling  more flowers although I haven't got many yet. I'm facing a big sort of conundrum for me  as a new grower not really knowing the right scale to be at because if I have too much  
**[0:03:25-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:25):**  produce and don't sell it, it's a big waste. If I don't have enough then it's difficult  to go to someone like a chef and say I can supply you with this amount of produce every  week because if I can't be consistent then they're not going to want to buy from me.  
**[0:03:43-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:43):**  I haven't really got the quantities of some things and I have of others. I've got lots  of salad but I've only sown small quantities of beans and beetroot because I'm just getting  to grips with the seeder and the size of land that I need for each particular crop and keeping  
**[0:04:04-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:04):**  on top of the weeds particularly bad are the red shank and the chickweed and the fat hen.  The couch grass isn't too bad now. In the polytunnel I'm just trying to get the support  wires up for the tomatoes. That's a bit of a job because it's quite difficult to know  
**[0:04:24-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:24):**  how to secure the wire to the ends of the polytunnel and I've got quite thick wire,  3.5mm high tension wire which is quite difficult to twist and hold in place. But once that's  up I can then order the compost that I'm going to make the beds out of and then I can start  
**[0:04:43-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:43):**  planting the tomatoes, chillies, aubergines, peppers and cucumbers which I've got for the  polytunnel and that will be exciting. Those should sow well so I'm hoping I will make  some money back on those. So that's all from me for now. Hopefully I'll be able to keep  
**[0:05:00-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:00):**  you updated over the next few weeks a bit more regularly than I have been and do leave  comments and get in touch. It's great to hear from people. This is proving to be one of  the most challenging things I've ever done. I wouldn't say it's been incredibly rewarding  
**[0:05:20-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:20):**  yet because I haven't really sold much and for me that's the key. If I can be selling  and making money and proving to myself that it's an economically viable enterprise then  I'll feel much happier. At the moment that's not clear so it's just faith and hope and  
**[0:05:41-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:41):**  persistence that's keeping me going and listening to other people and watching other people  and seeing that it should be possible. But there's so many things to get right that it's  quite challenging to do all those things at the same time and be experimenting and trying.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:01):**  But it's really nice to be outside. I am doing a bit of teaching as well which is a nice  mix, a nice change to be in the classroom and talking to kids about farming. But it's  great to be outside in this weather given that the winter was so long, cold and wet.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:18):**  It's great to be in the sun, hands in the soil, growing food. Bye for now.

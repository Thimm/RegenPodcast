**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:00):**  Good evening everyone, it's the 25th of June 2018. The sound you can hear in the background  
**[0:00:13-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:13):**  is a impact sprayer, an irrigation unit that I've just got. Finally I've got a hose with  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:24):**  a wand so I can water in the polytunnel and out in the field without going backwards and  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:30):**  forwards with two watering cans which is what I was doing before. It's about 20 metres from  
**[0:00:34-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:34):**  the tap to the start of the field and then another about 50 metres to the end of the  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:42):**  plot. So that should save a lot of time. I'm just experimenting with the sprinkler. This  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:48):**  is a part circle sprinkler, I've never had one before so I'm just trying to work out  
**[0:00:54-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:00:54):**  how it works and adjust it. At the moment it seems to be spraying quite well but only  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:02):**  really watering the end point of the jet and not the bit in between the end point and the  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:08):**  actual sprayer, the tripod that it's mounted on. So I guess I have to keep moving it or  
**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:15):**  turning the water up and down. So I haven't recorded anything for a while, it's been very  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:22):**  busy. I've been continuing to be driving back and forth between Norwich and Peterborough  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:30):**  and Peterborough and London and everything has been growing like crazy on the farm. There's  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:36):**  been lots of ups and downs. I've had a few moments where I felt like I might pack it  
**[0:01:42-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:42):**  in, just too much stress and too many challenges and not feeling entirely happy in this location  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:50):**  and that's partly to do with not feeling totally happy on the farm and partly to do with the  
**[0:01:57-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:01:57):**  area and not knowing anybody and farming is quite a lonely business. So I feel that and  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:08):**  I haven't really found any markets to sell my produce so that feels like a big challenge  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:15):**  that I've yet to get to grips with just because I'm too busy on the actual farm to be driving  
**[0:02:21-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:21):**  around visiting places. So that's a bit demoralising not having anyone to sell to apart from the  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:30):**  shop. We're in the process of working out our prices. Lots of things are growing really  
**[0:02:36-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:36):**  well and with the hot weather it's really nice to be outside and harvesting vegetables.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:46):**  At the moment I'm harvesting onions, spring onions, lots of salad, radish, cabbages, coriander,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:02:56):**  peas and very soon I should have some courgettes. Sweetcorn is about a foot high. There's quite  
**[0:03:05-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:05):**  a lot of sweet peas but they're not really selling in the shop so I'd like to be selling  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:13):**  more flowers although I haven't got many yet. I'm facing a big sort of conundrum for me  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:20):**  as a new grower not really knowing the right scale to be at because if I have too much  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:25):**  produce and don't sell it, it's a big waste. If I don't have enough then it's difficult  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:31):**  to go to someone like a chef and say I can supply you with this amount of produce every  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:36):**  week because if I can't be consistent then they're not going to want to buy from me.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:43):**  I haven't really got the quantities of some things and I have of others. I've got lots  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:47):**  of salad but I've only sown small quantities of beans and beetroot because I'm just getting  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:03:55):**  to grips with the seeder and the size of land that I need for each particular crop and keeping  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:04):**  on top of the weeds particularly bad are the red shank and the chickweed and the fat hen.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:12):**  The couch grass isn't too bad now. In the polytunnel I'm just trying to get the support  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:18):**  wires up for the tomatoes. That's a bit of a job because it's quite difficult to know  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:24):**  how to secure the wire to the ends of the polytunnel and I've got quite thick wire,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:29):**  3.5mm high tension wire which is quite difficult to twist and hold in place. But once that's  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:36):**  up I can then order the compost that I'm going to make the beds out of and then I can start  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:43):**  planting the tomatoes, chillies, aubergines, peppers and cucumbers which I've got for the  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:48):**  polytunnel and that will be exciting. Those should sow well so I'm hoping I will make  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:04:53):**  some money back on those. So that's all from me for now. Hopefully I'll be able to keep  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:00):**  you updated over the next few weeks a bit more regularly than I have been and do leave  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:07):**  comments and get in touch. It's great to hear from people. This is proving to be one of  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:14):**  the most challenging things I've ever done. I wouldn't say it's been incredibly rewarding  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:20):**  yet because I haven't really sold much and for me that's the key. If I can be selling  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:26):**  and making money and proving to myself that it's an economically viable enterprise then  
**[0:05:33-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:33):**  I'll feel much happier. At the moment that's not clear so it's just faith and hope and  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:41):**  persistence that's keeping me going and listening to other people and watching other people  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:46):**  and seeing that it should be possible. But there's so many things to get right that it's  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:05:55):**  quite challenging to do all those things at the same time and be experimenting and trying.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:01):**  But it's really nice to be outside. I am doing a bit of teaching as well which is a nice  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:07):**  mix, a nice change to be in the classroom and talking to kids about farming. But it's  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:13):**  great to be outside in this weather given that the winter was so long, cold and wet.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-june#t=0:06:18):**  It's great to be in the sun, hands in the soil, growing food. Bye for now.

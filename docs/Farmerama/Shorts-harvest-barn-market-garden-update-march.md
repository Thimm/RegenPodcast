**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, it's Joel here at Harvest Barn Farm Shop in the Market Garden.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:13):**  It's the 20th of March, day 50 of my time here and the last few days and weeks I've  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:23):**  been working on the polytunnel.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:25):**  This is a 20 by 54 foot polytunnel.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:29):**  It's taken quite a bit longer than I was expecting.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:32):**  I've had some help and I've also been working on it on my own.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:36):**  It takes a lot longer when you're on your own.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:39):**  The levelling up and the measuring is the thing that's taken the longest but I'm getting  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:44):**  there.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:45):**  I've got the timber rails on the sides now.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:48):**  There's a little bit more to do and then I've got to find a time to get some more friends  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:53):**  hopefully and put the plastic cover on and then do the doors and then it will be finished.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:00:59):**  So it's exciting to think that I will have that fairly soon but it has been a lot of  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:04):**  work.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:06):**  I've had a bit of a delay with the seeds because I've run out of space in my flat to sow seeds  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:12):**  and the soil has been too wet and cold to sow anything direct.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:18):**  So I'm really waiting for some space in the polytunnel to be able to sow some seeds in  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:24):**  trays and I can't do that until the plastic covers on so that may be two or three weeks  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:28):**  away.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:29):**  It's also taken me a long time to do my seed order which I still haven't done.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:35):**  Even if I had done it I wouldn't be able to sow them so I'm not too worried about that  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:39):**  but it is getting quite late in the season.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:41):**  But then with all the cold weather I guess everything is going to be a bit delayed this  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:46):**  year but it's just taken a long time to work out how many beds of each vegetable and flower  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:53):**  to grow and what varieties and which company to order from.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:01:57):**  So a lot of research, a lot of internet, time online, asking people for advice.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:05):**  I think I've finally got a list and it will be a lot of trial and error to see what works  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:11):**  and what sells and whether I've ordered too many seeds or not enough seeds.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:15):**  I'm trying to look at green manures as well, hopefully have a few beds of those.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:21):**  I'm going to try and have ten beds of sunflowers just to experiment with different sunflowers  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:26):**  and see if we can sell them in the shop.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:29):**  It's been bitterly cold recently so it's been impossible to do anything out in the market  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:35):**  garden itself.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:37):**  Just now it did start to warm up and amazingly the soil is already starting to dry out on  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:43):**  top.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:44):**  This feneland soil is incredible despite the days of cold and rain and snow.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:50):**  Within an hour or two of the sun coming out the surface is dried so things will start  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:55):**  growing again.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:02:58):**  Excitingly the tulips and narcissus are coming up, they're a couple of inches high.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:02):**  We were hoping we might have some bunches to sell in the shop for Easter weekend but  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:07):**  they probably won't be ready by then.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:09):**  But as with everything it's difficult to predict too far ahead.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:14):**  So that's how things are going here on the market garden.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:17):**  It will all start to get quite busy as the weather gets warmer and things are growing  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:24):**  faster so in a way I'm glad for the weather although it's been pretty hard work outside  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:31):**  in these winds.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:32):**  Yesterday I think it was minus one and felt like minus seven with the wind chill factor.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update-march#t=0:03:40):**  So looking forward to the spring and a new phase in the market garden.

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:00):**  So we've just completed five farms in two days here in rural Greece and I've been really  
**[0:00:12-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:12):**  impressed with the resilience, the innovation, the connecting up people and places are doing  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:21):**  with each other, with their land.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:25):**  Every farm was different.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:27):**  We had large cereal biodynamic farms, very aesthetically interesting herb farms, one  
**[0:00:36-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:36):**  of the first hemp farms in Greece, more herbs for making essential oil and an urban garden  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:50):**  in Thessalonica.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:52):**  So each place was completely different but what was really noteworthy I suppose was the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:59):**  farmers of the groups, the last thing they were thinking about was subsidies, they were  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:03):**  thinking about finding ways to make their products interesting and relevant to people  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:10):**  and finding ways to connect up with other people in other communities.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:14):**  They were also really willing to come up with new crops, new techniques to discover the  
**[0:01:20-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:20):**  new in the old through agro-ecological techniques, trying new products out, trying new crops,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:30):**  really just work out ways to come up with new information where necessary.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:37):**  For example, the farm where there was essential oils being produced, they were trialing three  
**[0:01:46-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:46):**  different plots, three different organic systems on seven plots each, so 21 plots with three  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:54):**  different styles of organic fertilizing and they were doing this in a relationship with  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:00):**  a university and they also were using basic sensors to take lice and yeast readings and  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:09):**  this was all with a view to find out what's the best way to produce essential oil from  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:15):**  their particular crop in their particular fields.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:19):**  And they were also by engaging with the scientists as well, they were helping to really catch  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:24):**  very early on diseases and fungus and so on and the scientists were just at a very high  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:29):**  level and were able to come up with ways for them to treat those organically as quickly  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:35):**  as possible.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:36):**  So this is an example of just some of the production based innovation but then also  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:42):**  as well on the urban garden, we saw social innovation because our land in sort of potentially  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:50):**  or possibly owned by the army or formerly owned by the army in a sort of a dynamic relationship  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:55):**  between the army and the municipal authorities anyway, certainly you could say that about  
**[0:02:59-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:59):**  the land, was taken really by citizens to grow food and to have a place to meet, a place  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:07):**  of sort of peace in a city context, in a city where there's huge economic and social problems.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:15):**  Since the crisis started here in Greece, the urban garden really came up with sort of social  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:20):**  innovation whereby people could come together in what's a reclaimed public space and engage  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:27):**  with each other and grow really good food for themselves.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:30):**  So really and everywhere had its own story in these five places over two days having  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:37):**  driven hundreds of miles all around rural Greece.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:41):**  So what this tells me is that there is great hope and optimism really.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:46):**  People are willing to try new things and try to engage with each other and with new ideas,  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:53):**  new practices and new technologies in an appropriate way to help themselves connect with people  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:01):**  who want the products that they're going to be able to produce off their land.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:05):**  And in many cases it's already happening and in other cases the relationships are getting  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:10):**  deeper which is significant.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:13):**  So can you tell me Pavlos where we're going to be over the next two days?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:19):**  So we met a number of people in the European Rural Sustainability Gathering in Lake Plastiras  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:25):**  on the mountains.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:29):**  A couple of projects I haven't heard of.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:32):**  So we're heading to the plains of Thessaly.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:36):**  This is the largest flatland of Greece.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:41):**  It's considered to be the breadbasket of Greece as a country with many islands and rugged  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:48):**  terrain.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:51):**  There are not so many regions with big plains where high output agriculture can take place.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:01):**  Of course this has had a lot of impact on the environment in terms of water resource  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:05):**  management, in terms of contamination of soils with chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:12):**  However we are going to meet a number of very hopeful projects.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:16):**  We are going to the Trinity Farm to meet Alexandra Tsianti who is the first large scale biodynamic  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:24):**  cereals farm of Greece doing an amazing job vertical production of different cereals and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:32):**  legumes and fresh vegetables.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:34):**  Then we're going to head to the town of Larissa to visit the Ephkarpia Farm, a very interesting  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:49):**  farming project.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:50):**  Again it's a large farm which has dedicated a number of hectares in the cultivation of  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:55):**  organic Greek herbs.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:59):**  And also those two farms are open farms so they are visitable farms, multifunctional  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:04):**  farms.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:06):**  Then we're going to head to Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece which is  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:12):**  emerging as one of the hotspots of the social economy, solidarity economy.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:21):**  This is where one of the very first, if not the first and still surviving community garden  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:28):**  was developed, Perka, in a former army camp.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:34):**  And of course you can imagine the symbolism of turning an army camp into a community garden.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:42):**  Then we are going to visit an organic oregano farm which also produces essential oils.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:54):**  So we are talking about small farmers, small organic farmers adding value to their organic  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:01):**  production.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:02):**  It is an experimental farm collaborating with universities and research projects to do a  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:12):**  number of environmental measurements and sensing.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:16):**  So I'm pretty excited to visit those guys, look like they have a good merge of traditional  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:24):**  and technological innovation.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:27):**  And then we're going to head south towards Athens and make a stop at the village of Kokkina  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:34):**  which is by the city of Volos to meet Parmenion who is again a large-scale organic farmer  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:41):**  of cereals.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:43):**  And interestingly enough, one of the very first growers of industrial hemp in Greece,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:50):**  organic industrial hemp for the social cooperative Cannabio.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:55):**  This is also quite interesting because the crop is being reintroduced in Greece after  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:02):**  six decades of prohibition and bears a very promising story of ecological and economic  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:12):**  and social regeneration in rural areas.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:16):**  And I'm pretty excited about that because all the places we are going are pretty isolated,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:22):**  mountains, deep in valleys, off the beaten track.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:27):**  And I've never visited those projects apart from Perka.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:33):**  I know some of the people for a number of times and I'm really excited to visit them  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:38):**  and see what happens.

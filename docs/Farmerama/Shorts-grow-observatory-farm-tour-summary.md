**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:00):**  So we've just completed five farms in two days here in rural Greece and I've been really  impressed with the resilience, the innovation, the connecting up people and places are doing  with each other, with their land.  Every farm was different.  We had large cereal biodynamic farms, very aesthetically interesting herb farms, one  
**[0:00:36-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:00:36):**  of the first hemp farms in Greece, more herbs for making essential oil and an urban garden  in Thessalonica.  So each place was completely different but what was really noteworthy I suppose was the  farmers of the groups, the last thing they were thinking about was subsidies, they were  thinking about finding ways to make their products interesting and relevant to people  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:10):**  and finding ways to connect up with other people in other communities.  They were also really willing to come up with new crops, new techniques to discover the  new in the old through agro-ecological techniques, trying new products out, trying new crops,  really just work out ways to come up with new information where necessary.  For example, the farm where there was essential oils being produced, they were trialing three  
**[0:01:46-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:01:46):**  different plots, three different organic systems on seven plots each, so 21 plots with three  different styles of organic fertilizing and they were doing this in a relationship with  a university and they also were using basic sensors to take lice and yeast readings and  this was all with a view to find out what's the best way to produce essential oil from  their particular crop in their particular fields.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:19):**  And they were also by engaging with the scientists as well, they were helping to really catch  very early on diseases and fungus and so on and the scientists were just at a very high  level and were able to come up with ways for them to treat those organically as quickly  as possible.  So this is an example of just some of the production based innovation but then also  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:02:42):**  as well on the urban garden, we saw social innovation because our land in sort of potentially  or possibly owned by the army or formerly owned by the army in a sort of a dynamic relationship  between the army and the municipal authorities anyway, certainly you could say that about  the land, was taken really by citizens to grow food and to have a place to meet, a place  of sort of peace in a city context, in a city where there's huge economic and social problems.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:15):**  Since the crisis started here in Greece, the urban garden really came up with sort of social  innovation whereby people could come together in what's a reclaimed public space and engage  with each other and grow really good food for themselves.  So really and everywhere had its own story in these five places over two days having  driven hundreds of miles all around rural Greece.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:03:41):**  So what this tells me is that there is great hope and optimism really.  People are willing to try new things and try to engage with each other and with new ideas,  new practices and new technologies in an appropriate way to help themselves connect with people  who want the products that they're going to be able to produce off their land.  And in many cases it's already happening and in other cases the relationships are getting  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:10):**  deeper which is significant.  So can you tell me Pavlos where we're going to be over the next two days?  So we met a number of people in the European Rural Sustainability Gathering in Lake Plastiras  on the mountains.  A couple of projects I haven't heard of.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:04:32):**  So we're heading to the plains of Thessaly.  This is the largest flatland of Greece.  It's considered to be the breadbasket of Greece as a country with many islands and rugged  terrain.  There are not so many regions with big plains where high output agriculture can take place.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:01):**  Of course this has had a lot of impact on the environment in terms of water resource  management, in terms of contamination of soils with chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  However we are going to meet a number of very hopeful projects.  We are going to the Trinity Farm to meet Alexandra Tsianti who is the first large scale biodynamic  cereals farm of Greece doing an amazing job vertical production of different cereals and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:32):**  legumes and fresh vegetables.  Then we're going to head to the town of Larissa to visit the Ephkarpia Farm, a very interesting  farming project.  Again it's a large farm which has dedicated a number of hectares in the cultivation of  organic Greek herbs.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:05:59):**  And also those two farms are open farms so they are visitable farms, multifunctional  farms.  Then we're going to head to Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece which is  emerging as one of the hotspots of the social economy, solidarity economy.  This is where one of the very first, if not the first and still surviving community garden  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:06:28):**  was developed, Perka, in a former army camp.  And of course you can imagine the symbolism of turning an army camp into a community garden.  Then we are going to visit an organic oregano farm which also produces essential oils.  So we are talking about small farmers, small organic farmers adding value to their organic  production.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:02):**  It is an experimental farm collaborating with universities and research projects to do a  number of environmental measurements and sensing.  So I'm pretty excited to visit those guys, look like they have a good merge of traditional  and technological innovation.  And then we're going to head south towards Athens and make a stop at the village of Kokkina  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:07:34):**  which is by the city of Volos to meet Parmenion who is again a large-scale organic farmer  of cereals.  And interestingly enough, one of the very first growers of industrial hemp in Greece,  organic industrial hemp for the social cooperative Cannabio.  This is also quite interesting because the crop is being reintroduced in Greece after  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:02):**  six decades of prohibition and bears a very promising story of ecological and economic  and social regeneration in rural areas.  And I'm pretty excited about that because all the places we are going are pretty isolated,  mountains, deep in valleys, off the beaten track.  And I've never visited those projects apart from Perka.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/pavlos-and-olly#t=0:08:33):**  I know some of the people for a number of times and I'm really excited to visit them  and see what happens.

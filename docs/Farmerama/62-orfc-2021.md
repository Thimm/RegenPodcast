### Farmerama  (2021-01-31)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama. This month we invite you to join us as we take a dip  into some of the key sessions at the recent Global Oxford Real Farming Conference, where  Farmerama were official media partners again this year.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:25):**  Nimo Bassi is Director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation. He set the scene for this  year's conference at the start of the opening session.  So on the whole, food sovereignty is the key to the future on the continent. This is what  
**[0:00:43-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:43):**  the majority of the farmers are fighting for, is what they practice. They practice agroecology,  they're working with nature, they're using local inputs. They understand that food is  not just a thing for eating, but a thing for celebration, that food is life. The story  
**[0:01:02-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:02):**  of food is being lost by the uniform production of commodified food products that are only  available in the supermarket rather than in the community.  I would like to conclude by saying that this system has eaten so deep and must be fought  
**[0:01:21-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:21):**  against very vigorously, and I believe that the real food conference is an excellent platform  for sharing ideas and tools on how to confront the situation where agriculture is about finance,  rather than about culture, rather than about food, about social life, about people's spirituality.  
**[0:01:44-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:44):**  These are things that we need to fight against together. This is what the farmers on the  continent are confronting. We just want to see to halt the loss of complexity and meaning  in food systems, because agriculture is life and food is a celebration.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:13):**  I don't even think the dust has settled. There is so much, there's so much content,  there's so much inspiration to draw from this year, and I literally have been inspired  by a lot of the sessions that focused on equity and justice and human rights, but also the  
**[0:02:38-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:38):**  sessions that were on Earth jurisprudence, on Earth rights, on nature rights, on Indigenous knowledge.  Dee Woods of Granville Community Kitchen and the Lamb Workers Alliance. You'll be hearing  from Dee again as she shares her experiences with the farmers and the farmers in the community.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:05):**  You'll be hearing from Dee again as she shares thoughts and reflections on a few key sessions,  along with Kimberly Bell, creator of Small Food Bakery. For the first time, the conference  was all online, and whilst it was sad not to be together in person, a whole world of  
**[0:03:23-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:23):**  new opportunity opened up. We loved hearing from producers in over 70 countries from China  to the Ivory Coast. It really was incredible. There are so many amazing talks, and we're  only able to touch on four highlights in this episode, but we're excited to say that all  
**[0:03:42-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:42):**  talks are available on the ORFC YouTube channel, so you can go and watch as many as you like.  And Farmerama also did daily briefings throughout the conference, which are on our Instagram  TV channel, if you want further pointers of what to watch. One of the main themes at this  
**[0:04:01-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:01):**  year's conference was how many of us relate to the earth as if we have dominion over it,  not that we are part of it, and how fundamentally that puts us in an extractive mindset. We  heard how this is embedded in legal systems, in language, in economics, in farming, and  
**[0:04:20-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:20):**  so much more. And people from all over the world share different ways of understanding  this relationship, and how that translates into our food system.  Within Māori cosmology, the river is central to the existence of the Māori. They treat  
**[0:04:47-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:47):**  it as their ancestor, as you genuinely think of them being descended from the river. And  so they have the saying, the saying ko'otiaua, ko'otiaua ko'o, the transliteration, the literal  meaning, I am the river and the river is me, but of course words don't just mean their  
**[0:05:10-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:10):**  literal meaning. They really get at the fact that the health and the well-being of the  river is intrinsically connected with the health and well-being of the people themselves.  And so the people are inseparable from the river if they're not healthy, no if they,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:26):**  if the river's not healthy, they're not healthy and vice versa.  That was Catherine Irons-Magallanes, Professor of Law at Victoria University of Wellington,  Aotearoa, New Zealand. This session was called We Are the River, and Catherine explained  
**[0:05:44-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:44):**  how in some cases the Crown or settler state and particular indigenous tribes have found  a way to hopefully move forward together after many years of conflict and oppression by the  Crown. It started with the Whanganui River and also includes Te Uruwera Rainforest. Both  
**[0:06:05-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:05):**  have been given legal personhood, which means in both the eyes of the Māori tribes and  the eyes of the Crown, the river is not owned by anyone. The river owns herself with all  the rights and responsibilities of a person. Not only that, but the river has rights in  
**[0:06:25-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:25):**  line with Māori wisdom. The statute states that Te Awatupua comprises the river as an  indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating its tributaries  and all its physical and metaphysical elements.  
**[0:06:45-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:45):**  So all of the land that makes up Te Uruwera Establishment Land has been vested within  Te Uruwera herself, and no human owns her, right? And then there's a board that's been  appointed to speak on her behalf, which is also distinct from the Whanganui River example  
**[0:07:06-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:06):**  that Kathy shared. So the board that has been appointed has nine people. Six of them are  from Tūhoe, from our iwi, our tribe, and three of them are from the Crown. We think  of loa as relationships. So how do we relate to each other? And how do we relate to the  
**[0:07:24-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:24):**  whenua, to the land? So it's a worldview. We need to understand that this Western perspective  that is globalised and taken over through colonisation is just one worldview, alongside  very many others, including a Tūhoe worldview. So from a Western colonial legal system worldview,  
**[0:07:46-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:46):**  the land is something we relate to each other as owners or shareholders of a land, and we  relate to the land as a resource, which we manage, that we own. Okay, from a Tūhoe perspective,  ownership of land is arrogant. And I purposely use that word as a provocative word. It is  
**[0:08:07-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:07):**  arrogant. It is a superiority complex as a human to feel like an owner of the land. And  that is because we are from the land. The land was here long before we were. She is  our mother, a papatūānuku, and we are her children. And so legal personhood is a wonderful  
**[0:08:28-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:28):**  tool that we're able to use within our Western legal system, which is our dominant legal  system here in Aotearoa, to introduce and be able to legislate for our perspective,  because in that we have legislation that says no, the land owns herself, and we are simply  
**[0:08:46-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:46):**  caretakers. So instead of being owners of the land, we have responsibilities to the  land.  Coming from the Caribbean and being a displaced African, as it were, but being of mixed heritage  
**[0:09:05-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:05):**  and having indigenous ancestry as well, it felt so important that we are doing this,  that we are protecting our Earth because we're part of the Earth. The Earth is our mother.  Vandana Shiva says, you know, the Earth is our relative. And that session just brought  
**[0:09:30-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:30):**  it home for me.  One of the biggest issues is our imagination. We've been limited by this colonisation and  imposition of a colonial legal system has limited our ability to actually see how else  
**[0:09:45-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:45):**  we can relate to the whenua, to the land. So when it comes to ownership and private  property and we think, oh, there's all these limitations, there's enforceable laws, we  need to remember that's just one worldview. And we need to remember, look back at our  
**[0:09:59-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:59):**  history. How did that worldview form? It's actually grounded in violence. It's grounded  in Roman colonisation of Europe and the spread of that, the doctrine of discovery. If we  can realise that that is just one way and we have our ability to remember how we relate  
**[0:10:20-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:20):**  to the Earth and instead of owning the rights or feeling this sort of superiority where  we can just take and take and take, we're actually recognising in our actions and our  practice how to relate. We have extracted so much from the Earth that we are now risking  
**[0:10:38-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:38):**  our survival as a species. Where did that come from? Understanding all of the different,  so the doctrine of discovery, even the witch hunts for 400 years of really annihilating  the European indigenous and pagan rituals of connection with the land and how that translated  
**[0:10:57-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:57):**  into colonisation of our lands and Turu Island and all these places. So I think the more  we can talk and have these conversations as we are, the more we're going to actually realise  that our bodies and our way to our spirits and our way is connected with the Earth and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:15):**  our joy is actually connected with the Earth. And as we start to build that intimacy in  our relationship again, it's not just a Māori worldview. I think these perspectives are  universal actually. And I think that's a lot of what this conference is covering as  
**[0:11:30-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:30):**  recognition of these relationships and the need to return to this slower world of connection  and of love between the human and the whenua and stop the superiority complex of extraction  and resources.  
**[0:11:48-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:48):**  I've always been a little perplexed by the way Friends in New Zealand moves seamlessly  between Māori and English words. It felt jarring to me. However, one of the things  I took from the conference was that the diversity of languages is a vital part of the biodiversity  
**[0:12:06-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:06):**  of our future. As Rebecca Hosking highlighted in her session, Sharing the Land with All  Life, many indigenous peoples don't have a word for nature. It's the mother or the  home. There is no concept that they are separate from the natural world. As we can see in this  
**[0:12:27-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:27):**  legal statute, many of the Māori concepts are very difficult to define in English, but  fit perfectly in just three Māori words. Embracing Māori language seems to be part  of opening up to another worldview, one of the many, as Erin pointed out.  
**[0:12:52-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:52):**  The New Economics Foundation and Growing Communities, a London-based CSA, have worked together to  understand the community benefits of localised routes to market and local organic food. Their  work is interesting because it tries to explain this in financial terms. How much value goes  
**[0:13:11-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:11):**  to the eater, the farmer, the earth? In the session, they shared lots of detail about  how they structured their economic evaluation. And here, Christian Giacorini, a senior consultant  at the New Economics Foundation, summarises the key findings. And then Kimberly explains  
**[0:13:31-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:31):**  why she thought this was such an important piece of work.  We find that growing communities is a highly efficient method of food distribution. We  also find that it's primarily a social intervention, but it's also an environmental one. So the  
**[0:13:47-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:47):**  vast majority of benefit accrues to consumers and their households, and they receive an  estimated 87% of total benefits. And then for every pound spent, they receive £3.46  of the economic and social value generated as a result, with the environment being the  
**[0:14:06-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:06):**  next biggest beneficiary receiving 32 pence. Another conclusion really is that by utilising  these short supply chains and by working in partnership with farmers, growing communities  is able to redistribute economic power to farmers, providing them with the financial  
**[0:14:23-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:23):**  security to generate considerable social value for themselves and even greater benefits for  the environment. So as Julie said at the off, it's by empowering farmers, by supporting  them that we're able to generate these environmental externalities which benefit all of us ultimately.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:42):**  And then this is all achieved while offering consumers a product that we estimate returns  them an additional £2.46 for every pound they spent. It's a vote of confidence in growing  communities overall. A couple of years ago, the Sustainable Food  
**[0:14:58-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:58):**  Trust published this amazing study that they'd undertaken called the True Cost of Food, which  I thought was quite revelatory, the headline simply being that for every £1 we spent on  food in the UK, there was another £1 that they'd identified as hidden costs. And this  
**[0:15:19-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:19):**  study is often referred to as the way of making a point, but I've been curious to watch people's  response to it and people often look a bit blank or glazed over and not quite as excited  as I think they should be. And I think the truth is that people really respond to positive  
**[0:15:36-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:36):**  news more than negative news and that's what I was really excited about, this session around  the Growing Communities Network and Julie and Christian's work to try to put a value  on it through a series of economic study. The difference being that they're looking  
**[0:15:55-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:55):**  at value and not cost and that's a benefit to people and it's a more positive story.  I'm often quite sceptical about complex systems of metrics for measuring food systems. I wonder  when we start to create these complex measurements whether it's actually quite disempowering  
**[0:16:16-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:16):**  and really removes us from the point of just having person to person social exchange. And  I just love the visual that it gave me or that it brought to mind was just thinking  about the big food system and about how there are many people shopping in the system and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:33):**  gleaning their food from it and all the value from those many is just really going up vertically  into an ever narrowing system and all of the wealth is ending up at the top. And there  was something quite poetic about this session just sort of illustrating that in their system  
**[0:16:52-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:52):**  the customer was actually getting most of the value. They were looking at social impact  things like how they asked their customers through receiving the veg box instead of going  to the supermarket how much extra time do they get to spend with their children and  
**[0:17:10-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:10):**  things like that often go unrecorded or unnoticed when comparing localised food systems to big  corporate ones. Every patch of earth unencumbered by concrete where soil and atmosphere meet  is a portal to presence a terrain of remembrance a vote for survival and an unpromised future.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:37):**  These gardens are blueprints of interdependent destiny intergenerational memory saving seeds  for food as remedy.

Thanks to Naima Penniman for her beautiful poem from her session These Gardens are Blueprints  
**[0:19:46-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:19:46):**  Sowing the Seeds of Food Justice.  Definitely recommend tuning in to the whole session.  There are more poems.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:04):**  Dee Woods hosted a session called Food Justice, Not Food Aid.  One of the speakers was Stephanie Swannepoel, cooperative manager at Oceanview Organics,  a cause gangsters initiative based in Oceanview, Cape Town, a deprived area of the city.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:19):**  Oceanview Organics is a cooperative run by five local women.  They have a bakery, cafe, and produce local organic food for the community.  So for me, I mean, food justice means one, the right to access food, to have food, but  
**[0:20:36-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:36):**  also to be able to choose the food that you want to eat, and to be able to cook it in  the way that you want to cook it, and to be able to eat with your family and feed them  properly.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:46):**  And that means having access to productive resources.  So that means that we all we all should have the right to productive land, water, obviously,  we can't all own farms.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:58):**  But we should all be able to reclaim the commons, if that makes sense.  So I think that there needs to be a big shift towards towards that kind of thinking.  And also food justice for me is about reestablishing people's agency.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:15):**  Because food aid, as David was saying, strips people of the agency to make decisions in  their life.  And our food system, currently is very much like that, you know, 60% more expensive to  
**[0:21:27-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:27):**  eat healthy, you go into a supermarket, they've already determined, you know, what's in the  food, how it's processed.  We have very little choice, we might think we have choice, because we're seeing seven  
**[0:21:40-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:40):**  different kinds of mayonnaise, for example.  But it's exactly the same kind of mayonnaise, it's exactly the same kind of process thing.  I think for me, food justice rests a lot around supporting and bolstering our agency and our  
**[0:21:56-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:56):**  right to choose.  We're all fighting all those powers that be, but at the same time, co-creating within our  communities and with nature to build the systems that we want.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:14):**  And that's what I'm taking forward, you know, that we have to be building what we want in  the here and now.  We need to make that vision a reality.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:28):**  Communities that are really up against it, that they can be creating so much that impacts  on people's life.  And food is life, good food is life.  
**[0:22:42-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:42):**  And I'm so proud to be part of that universal family that is protecting the earth, that  is protecting seed, that is protecting legacy, as well as creating the food systems that  we want to see.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:06):**  To finish, we wanted to share one of the final sessions at the conference called Indigenous  Farming and Land Stewardship on Turtle Island.  It was a powerful way to end.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:18):**  And as with all of the talks featured, we definitely recommend you tune in.  Here is a short excerpt from Rowan White, an Indigenous seed keeper and leader with  the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:34):**  How can we cultivate as Indigenous peoples, the ancestral brilliance that we bring?  My ancestors on the record at the beginning of this idea of America, during the Revolutionary  War, General Sullivan, upon orders of George Washington, was ordered to burn down cornfields  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:54):**  in Western New York.  And it was said on those papers that they burned over a million bushels of corn.  And that is pre-industrial.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:02):**  That is the brilliance of my ancestors using people power, using their incredible innovation  to grow mass amounts of food for the people.  The people as beneficiaries, the land as beneficiaries, all of our relations as beneficiaries.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:17):**  And so I think the question of the hour now that we're in, we want to talk about climate  chaos and we want to talk about late stage capitalism and the failings of that and all  of the incredible blowback that we're feeling now.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:33):**  How can we cultivate an economy, a regenerative, truly regenerative economy that's a reflection  of our Indigenous values?  And it's possible, right?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:41):**  It's very possible.  It's very possible to build an economy that is rooted in abundance and not scarcity.  And who are the people that have the blood memory to be able to conjure that up and create  
**[0:24:52-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:52):**  it and cultivate it in ways that create the future that our descendants deserve?  And it is our responsibility now, as with our ancestors behind us in this long lineage  of people, it is our responsibility to show up now and to honor them and honor their legacy  
**[0:25:08-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:08):**  and honor all of the atrocities that they endured to ensure that their ancestral brilliance  finds a new form today.  And so that's a question that I ask you as folks who are listening is thinking about  
**[0:25:23-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:23):**  is tending that possibility of what that economy of abundance and an Indigenous economy can  look like again and be thinking about who are the beneficiaries of our work?  As we're living in an era of Anthropocene, we're living in an era where humans are so  
**[0:25:38-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:38):**  centered, but we know that our ancestors had ways of working in right relationship with  all of our relations.  And so how are we bringing that together in new forms?  
**[0:25:50-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:50):**  We're going to bring the ancestor brilliance forward, but we're also going to combine it  with new innovation.  In all of the Black, Indigenous and bodies of culture, we have incredible visions that  
**[0:26:02-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:02):**  need to be nourished in the regenerative egg system.  And it's time for white folks to pass the mic.  It's time for white folks to resource us and to get us at the tables.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:14):**  There's also other beings at that table, seen and unseen, that must be there in order for  us to really cultivate the future of food that isn't just a crisis of culture.  And so I implore all of you who are listening to remember that somewhere back in your lineage,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:31):**  there was cultural sanity when it came to relational food landscapes.  And so how are we bringing forth all of our ancestral brilliance?  For me, the Turtle Island session was a really powerful end to the conference, which overall  
**[0:26:47-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:47):**  was a real re-education, I suppose, for me.  And this was a lovely, poignant, hard-hitting session with three speakers who were very  direct and very articulate.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:03):**  And I think it was sort of philosophically a great reminder of what's important, even  just the way the session was framed by the moderator.  We were reminded to sort of shut up and listen, really, and the session was a circle of conversation.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:20):**  I loved how each of the speakers responded to each other.  I think it was just a poignant reminder of why we all need a seat at the table and why  everybody needs to listen to everybody else.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:32):**  I think as a group or as an entire conference, we're trying to tackle a lot of very complex  issues and there is still a tendency to try to over-design really complex top-down systems  to solve some of our problems.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:53):**  And for me, this session just brought it back to what's real, which is people sharing stories  and people talking about how they feel and sharing their views and offering up a diversity  of meaningful solutions that are specific to the place where they are and the people  
**[0:28:14-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:14):**  who they live among.  We can take away from that the importance of a sense of place and the importance of  empowerment of individuals within a community, but also the community within a place in terms  
**[0:28:29-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:29):**  of being able to tackle some of these complex problems.  I think Rowan White delivered some amazing soundbite by incredibly articulate.  I think the most important thing that she said in summary was what does a culture of  
**[0:28:46-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:46):**  belonging in our food system look like?  And I think that's a brilliant lens through which we can reflect back on the whole conference  and maybe assess for ourselves the solutions that are proposed and the opinions that are  
**[0:29:02-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:02):**  offered and whether or not they are empowering and whether or not they include everybody  and whether or not they let people feel part of their own food network and food system.  By the end of the conference, it was clear that there is a global movement of people  
**[0:29:29-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:29):**  connecting with the land, the soils and all living beings.  Other people call that their relationship with Mother Earth, agroecology, regenerative  agriculture.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:41):**  We all have a lot to share and learn from each other.  It's going to take great acts of healing and paradigm shifts in mindset to tune into our  collective ancestral brilliance.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:55):**  And ORFC Global showed we are already on the journey.

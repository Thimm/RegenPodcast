### Farmerama  (Sun, 31 Jan 2021 19:13:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama. This month we invite you to join us as we take a dip  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:13):**  into some of the key sessions at the recent Global Oxford Real Farming Conference, where  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:19):**  Farmerama were official media partners again this year.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:25):**  Nimo Bassi is Director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation. He set the scene for this  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:31):**  year's conference at the start of the opening session.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:37):**  So on the whole, food sovereignty is the key to the future on the continent. This is what  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:43):**  the majority of the farmers are fighting for, is what they practice. They practice agroecology,  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:48):**  they're working with nature, they're using local inputs. They understand that food is  
**[0:00:55-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:00:55):**  not just a thing for eating, but a thing for celebration, that food is life. The story  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:02):**  of food is being lost by the uniform production of commodified food products that are only  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:08):**  available in the supermarket rather than in the community.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:14):**  I would like to conclude by saying that this system has eaten so deep and must be fought  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:21):**  against very vigorously, and I believe that the real food conference is an excellent platform  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:28):**  for sharing ideas and tools on how to confront the situation where agriculture is about finance,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:35):**  rather than about culture, rather than about food, about social life, about people's spirituality.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:44):**  These are things that we need to fight against together. This is what the farmers on the  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:51):**  continent are confronting. We just want to see to halt the loss of complexity and meaning  
**[0:01:58-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:01:58):**  in food systems, because agriculture is life and food is a celebration.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:13):**  I don't even think the dust has settled. There is so much, there's so much content,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:20):**  there's so much inspiration to draw from this year, and I literally have been inspired  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:31):**  by a lot of the sessions that focused on equity and justice and human rights, but also the  
**[0:02:38-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:38):**  sessions that were on Earth jurisprudence, on Earth rights, on nature rights, on Indigenous knowledge.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:52):**  Dee Woods of Granville Community Kitchen and the Lamb Workers Alliance. You'll be hearing  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:02:58):**  from Dee again as she shares her experiences with the farmers and the farmers in the community.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:05):**  You'll be hearing from Dee again as she shares thoughts and reflections on a few key sessions,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:11):**  along with Kimberly Bell, creator of Small Food Bakery. For the first time, the conference  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:17):**  was all online, and whilst it was sad not to be together in person, a whole world of  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:23):**  new opportunity opened up. We loved hearing from producers in over 70 countries from China  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:29):**  to the Ivory Coast. It really was incredible. There are so many amazing talks, and we're  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:36):**  only able to touch on four highlights in this episode, but we're excited to say that all  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:42):**  talks are available on the ORFC YouTube channel, so you can go and watch as many as you like.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:49):**  And Farmerama also did daily briefings throughout the conference, which are on our Instagram  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:03:55):**  TV channel, if you want further pointers of what to watch. One of the main themes at this  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:01):**  year's conference was how many of us relate to the earth as if we have dominion over it,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:07):**  not that we are part of it, and how fundamentally that puts us in an extractive mindset. We  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:14):**  heard how this is embedded in legal systems, in language, in economics, in farming, and  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:20):**  so much more. And people from all over the world share different ways of understanding  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:26):**  this relationship, and how that translates into our food system.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:40):**  Within M훮ori cosmology, the river is central to the existence of the M훮ori. They treat  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:47):**  it as their ancestor, as you genuinely think of them being descended from the river. And  
**[0:04:54-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:04:54):**  so they have the saying, the saying ko'otiaua, ko'otiaua ko'o, the transliteration, the literal  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:06):**  meaning, I am the river and the river is me, but of course words don't just mean their  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:10):**  literal meaning. They really get at the fact that the health and the well-being of the  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:15):**  river is intrinsically connected with the health and well-being of the people themselves.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:21):**  And so the people are inseparable from the river if they're not healthy, no if they,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:26):**  if the river's not healthy, they're not healthy and vice versa.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:32):**  That was Catherine Irons-Magallanes, Professor of Law at Victoria University of Wellington,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:38):**  Aotearoa, New Zealand. This session was called We Are the River, and Catherine explained  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:44):**  how in some cases the Crown or settler state and particular indigenous tribes have found  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:51):**  a way to hopefully move forward together after many years of conflict and oppression by the  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:05:57):**  Crown. It started with the Whanganui River and also includes Te Uruwera Rainforest. Both  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:05):**  have been given legal personhood, which means in both the eyes of the M훮ori tribes and  
**[0:06:11-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:11):**  the eyes of the Crown, the river is not owned by anyone. The river owns herself with all  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:19):**  the rights and responsibilities of a person. Not only that, but the river has rights in  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:25):**  line with M훮ori wisdom. The statute states that Te Awatupua comprises the river as an  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:33):**  indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating its tributaries  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:40):**  and all its physical and metaphysical elements.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:45):**  So all of the land that makes up Te Uruwera Establishment Land has been vested within  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:52):**  Te Uruwera herself, and no human owns her, right? And then there's a board that's been  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:06:59):**  appointed to speak on her behalf, which is also distinct from the Whanganui River example  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:06):**  that Kathy shared. So the board that has been appointed has nine people. Six of them are  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:12):**  from T큰hoe, from our iwi, our tribe, and three of them are from the Crown. We think  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:18):**  of loa as relationships. So how do we relate to each other? And how do we relate to the  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:24):**  whenua, to the land? So it's a worldview. We need to understand that this Western perspective  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:31):**  that is globalised and taken over through colonisation is just one worldview, alongside  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:38):**  very many others, including a T큰hoe worldview. So from a Western colonial legal system worldview,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:46):**  the land is something we relate to each other as owners or shareholders of a land, and we  
**[0:07:52-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:07:52):**  relate to the land as a resource, which we manage, that we own. Okay, from a T큰hoe perspective,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:01):**  ownership of land is arrogant. And I purposely use that word as a provocative word. It is  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:07):**  arrogant. It is a superiority complex as a human to feel like an owner of the land. And  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:14):**  that is because we are from the land. The land was here long before we were. She is  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:20):**  our mother, a papat큰훮nuku, and we are her children. And so legal personhood is a wonderful  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:28):**  tool that we're able to use within our Western legal system, which is our dominant legal  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:33):**  system here in Aotearoa, to introduce and be able to legislate for our perspective,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:40):**  because in that we have legislation that says no, the land owns herself, and we are simply  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:46):**  caretakers. So instead of being owners of the land, we have responsibilities to the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:53):**  land.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:08:54):**  Coming from the Caribbean and being a displaced African, as it were, but being of mixed heritage  
**[0:09:05-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:05):**  and having indigenous ancestry as well, it felt so important that we are doing this,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:16):**  that we are protecting our Earth because we're part of the Earth. The Earth is our mother.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:24):**  Vandana Shiva says, you know, the Earth is our relative. And that session just brought  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:30):**  it home for me.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:32):**  One of the biggest issues is our imagination. We've been limited by this colonisation and  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:38):**  imposition of a colonial legal system has limited our ability to actually see how else  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:45):**  we can relate to the whenua, to the land. So when it comes to ownership and private  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:50):**  property and we think, oh, there's all these limitations, there's enforceable laws, we  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:54):**  need to remember that's just one worldview. And we need to remember, look back at our  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:09:59):**  history. How did that worldview form? It's actually grounded in violence. It's grounded  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:05):**  in Roman colonisation of Europe and the spread of that, the doctrine of discovery. If we  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:12):**  can realise that that is just one way and we have our ability to remember how we relate  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:20):**  to the Earth and instead of owning the rights or feeling this sort of superiority where  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:27):**  we can just take and take and take, we're actually recognising in our actions and our  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:32):**  practice how to relate. We have extracted so much from the Earth that we are now risking  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:38):**  our survival as a species. Where did that come from? Understanding all of the different,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:45):**  so the doctrine of discovery, even the witch hunts for 400 years of really annihilating  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:50):**  the European indigenous and pagan rituals of connection with the land and how that translated  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:10:57):**  into colonisation of our lands and Turu Island and all these places. So I think the more  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:04):**  we can talk and have these conversations as we are, the more we're going to actually realise  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:08):**  that our bodies and our way to our spirits and our way is connected with the Earth and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:15):**  our joy is actually connected with the Earth. And as we start to build that intimacy in  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:20):**  our relationship again, it's not just a M훮ori worldview. I think these perspectives are  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:25):**  universal actually. And I think that's a lot of what this conference is covering as  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:30):**  recognition of these relationships and the need to return to this slower world of connection  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:38):**  and of love between the human and the whenua and stop the superiority complex of extraction  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:46):**  and resources.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:48):**  I've always been a little perplexed by the way Friends in New Zealand moves seamlessly  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:53):**  between M훮ori and English words. It felt jarring to me. However, one of the things  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:11:59):**  I took from the conference was that the diversity of languages is a vital part of the biodiversity  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:06):**  of our future. As Rebecca Hosking highlighted in her session, Sharing the Land with All  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:12):**  Life, many indigenous peoples don't have a word for nature. It's the mother or the  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:19):**  home. There is no concept that they are separate from the natural world. As we can see in this  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:27):**  legal statute, many of the M훮ori concepts are very difficult to define in English, but  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:34):**  fit perfectly in just three M훮ori words. Embracing M훮ori language seems to be part  
**[0:12:39-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:39):**  of opening up to another worldview, one of the many, as Erin pointed out.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:52):**  The New Economics Foundation and Growing Communities, a London-based CSA, have worked together to  
**[0:12:57-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:12:57):**  understand the community benefits of localised routes to market and local organic food. Their  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:05):**  work is interesting because it tries to explain this in financial terms. How much value goes  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:11):**  to the eater, the farmer, the earth? In the session, they shared lots of detail about  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:19):**  how they structured their economic evaluation. And here, Christian Giacorini, a senior consultant  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:26):**  at the New Economics Foundation, summarises the key findings. And then Kimberly explains  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:31):**  why she thought this was such an important piece of work.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:36):**  We find that growing communities is a highly efficient method of food distribution. We  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:41):**  also find that it's primarily a social intervention, but it's also an environmental one. So the  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:47):**  vast majority of benefit accrues to consumers and their households, and they receive an  
**[0:13:52-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:13:52):**  estimated 87% of total benefits. And then for every pound spent, they receive 짙3.46  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:00):**  of the economic and social value generated as a result, with the environment being the  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:06):**  next biggest beneficiary receiving 32 pence. Another conclusion really is that by utilising  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:13):**  these short supply chains and by working in partnership with farmers, growing communities  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:18):**  is able to redistribute economic power to farmers, providing them with the financial  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:23):**  security to generate considerable social value for themselves and even greater benefits for  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:29):**  the environment. So as Julie said at the off, it's by empowering farmers, by supporting  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:34):**  them that we're able to generate these environmental externalities which benefit all of us ultimately.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:42):**  And then this is all achieved while offering consumers a product that we estimate returns  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:47):**  them an additional 짙2.46 for every pound they spent. It's a vote of confidence in growing  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:54):**  communities overall. A couple of years ago, the Sustainable Food  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:14:58):**  Trust published this amazing study that they'd undertaken called the True Cost of Food, which  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:06):**  I thought was quite revelatory, the headline simply being that for every 짙1 we spent on  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:12):**  food in the UK, there was another 짙1 that they'd identified as hidden costs. And this  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:19):**  study is often referred to as the way of making a point, but I've been curious to watch people's  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:25):**  response to it and people often look a bit blank or glazed over and not quite as excited  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:30):**  as I think they should be. And I think the truth is that people really respond to positive  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:36):**  news more than negative news and that's what I was really excited about, this session around  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:41):**  the Growing Communities Network and Julie and Christian's work to try to put a value  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:48):**  on it through a series of economic study. The difference being that they're looking  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:15:55):**  at value and not cost and that's a benefit to people and it's a more positive story.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:01):**  I'm often quite sceptical about complex systems of metrics for measuring food systems. I wonder  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:10):**  when we start to create these complex measurements whether it's actually quite disempowering  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:16):**  and really removes us from the point of just having person to person social exchange. And  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:23):**  I just love the visual that it gave me or that it brought to mind was just thinking  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:28):**  about the big food system and about how there are many people shopping in the system and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:33):**  gleaning their food from it and all the value from those many is just really going up vertically  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:39):**  into an ever narrowing system and all of the wealth is ending up at the top. And there  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:45):**  was something quite poetic about this session just sort of illustrating that in their system  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:52):**  the customer was actually getting most of the value. They were looking at social impact  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:16:56):**  things like how they asked their customers through receiving the veg box instead of going  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:04):**  to the supermarket how much extra time do they get to spend with their children and  
**[0:17:10-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:10):**  things like that often go unrecorded or unnoticed when comparing localised food systems to big  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:19):**  corporate ones. Every patch of earth unencumbered by concrete where soil and atmosphere meet  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:17:27):**  is a portal to presence a terrain of remembrance a vote for survival and an unpromised future.

**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:19:41):**  Thanks to Naima Penniman for her beautiful poem from her session These Gardens are Blueprints  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:19:46):**  Sowing the Seeds of Food Justice.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:19:49):**  Definitely recommend tuning in to the whole session.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:19:52):**  There are more poems.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:04):**  Dee Woods hosted a session called Food Justice, Not Food Aid.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:08):**  One of the speakers was Stephanie Swannepoel, cooperative manager at Oceanview Organics,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:13):**  a cause gangsters initiative based in Oceanview, Cape Town, a deprived area of the city.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:19):**  Oceanview Organics is a cooperative run by five local women.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:23):**  They have a bakery, cafe, and produce local organic food for the community.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:27):**  So for me, I mean, food justice means one, the right to access food, to have food, but  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:36):**  also to be able to choose the food that you want to eat, and to be able to cook it in  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:40):**  the way that you want to cook it, and to be able to eat with your family and feed them  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:44):**  properly.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:46):**  And that means having access to productive resources.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:49):**  So that means that we all we all should have the right to productive land, water, obviously,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:55):**  we can't all own farms.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:20:58):**  But we should all be able to reclaim the commons, if that makes sense.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:04):**  So I think that there needs to be a big shift towards towards that kind of thinking.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:10):**  And also food justice for me is about reestablishing people's agency.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:15):**  Because food aid, as David was saying, strips people of the agency to make decisions in  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:20):**  their life.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:21):**  And our food system, currently is very much like that, you know, 60% more expensive to  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:27):**  eat healthy, you go into a supermarket, they've already determined, you know, what's in the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:33):**  food, how it's processed.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:36):**  We have very little choice, we might think we have choice, because we're seeing seven  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:40):**  different kinds of mayonnaise, for example.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:44):**  But it's exactly the same kind of mayonnaise, it's exactly the same kind of process thing.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:48):**  I think for me, food justice rests a lot around supporting and bolstering our agency and our  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:56):**  right to choose.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:21:58):**  We're all fighting all those powers that be, but at the same time, co-creating within our  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:07):**  communities and with nature to build the systems that we want.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:14):**  And that's what I'm taking forward, you know, that we have to be building what we want in  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:22):**  the here and now.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:23):**  We need to make that vision a reality.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:28):**  Communities that are really up against it, that they can be creating so much that impacts  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:34):**  on people's life.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:37):**  And food is life, good food is life.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:42):**  And I'm so proud to be part of that universal family that is protecting the earth, that  
**[0:22:52-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:22:52):**  is protecting seed, that is protecting legacy, as well as creating the food systems that  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:02):**  we want to see.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:06):**  To finish, we wanted to share one of the final sessions at the conference called Indigenous  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:11):**  Farming and Land Stewardship on Turtle Island.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:15):**  It was a powerful way to end.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:18):**  And as with all of the talks featured, we definitely recommend you tune in.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:23):**  Here is a short excerpt from Rowan White, an Indigenous seed keeper and leader with  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:28):**  the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:34):**  How can we cultivate as Indigenous peoples, the ancestral brilliance that we bring?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:40):**  My ancestors on the record at the beginning of this idea of America, during the Revolutionary  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:49):**  War, General Sullivan, upon orders of George Washington, was ordered to burn down cornfields  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:54):**  in Western New York.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:23:55):**  And it was said on those papers that they burned over a million bushels of corn.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:00):**  And that is pre-industrial.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:02):**  That is the brilliance of my ancestors using people power, using their incredible innovation  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:08):**  to grow mass amounts of food for the people.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:11):**  The people as beneficiaries, the land as beneficiaries, all of our relations as beneficiaries.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:17):**  And so I think the question of the hour now that we're in, we want to talk about climate  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:23):**  chaos and we want to talk about late stage capitalism and the failings of that and all  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:29):**  of the incredible blowback that we're feeling now.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:33):**  How can we cultivate an economy, a regenerative, truly regenerative economy that's a reflection  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:37):**  of our Indigenous values?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:39):**  And it's possible, right?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:41):**  It's very possible.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:42):**  It's very possible to build an economy that is rooted in abundance and not scarcity.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:47):**  And who are the people that have the blood memory to be able to conjure that up and create  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:52):**  it and cultivate it in ways that create the future that our descendants deserve?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:24:57):**  And it is our responsibility now, as with our ancestors behind us in this long lineage  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:03):**  of people, it is our responsibility to show up now and to honor them and honor their legacy  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:08):**  and honor all of the atrocities that they endured to ensure that their ancestral brilliance  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:15):**  finds a new form today.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:17):**  And so that's a question that I ask you as folks who are listening is thinking about  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:23):**  is tending that possibility of what that economy of abundance and an Indigenous economy can  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:29):**  look like again and be thinking about who are the beneficiaries of our work?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:34):**  As we're living in an era of Anthropocene, we're living in an era where humans are so  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:38):**  centered, but we know that our ancestors had ways of working in right relationship with  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:46):**  all of our relations.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:48):**  And so how are we bringing that together in new forms?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:50):**  We're going to bring the ancestor brilliance forward, but we're also going to combine it  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:54):**  with new innovation.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:25:56):**  In all of the Black, Indigenous and bodies of culture, we have incredible visions that  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:02):**  need to be nourished in the regenerative egg system.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:05):**  And it's time for white folks to pass the mic.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:08):**  It's time for white folks to resource us and to get us at the tables.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:14):**  There's also other beings at that table, seen and unseen, that must be there in order for  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:19):**  us to really cultivate the future of food that isn't just a crisis of culture.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:25):**  And so I implore all of you who are listening to remember that somewhere back in your lineage,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:31):**  there was cultural sanity when it came to relational food landscapes.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:36):**  And so how are we bringing forth all of our ancestral brilliance?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:39):**  For me, the Turtle Island session was a really powerful end to the conference, which overall  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:47):**  was a real re-education, I suppose, for me.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:26:52):**  And this was a lovely, poignant, hard-hitting session with three speakers who were very  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:00):**  direct and very articulate.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:03):**  And I think it was sort of philosophically a great reminder of what's important, even  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:08):**  just the way the session was framed by the moderator.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:12):**  We were reminded to sort of shut up and listen, really, and the session was a circle of conversation.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:20):**  I loved how each of the speakers responded to each other.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:23):**  I think it was just a poignant reminder of why we all need a seat at the table and why  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:30):**  everybody needs to listen to everybody else.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:32):**  I think as a group or as an entire conference, we're trying to tackle a lot of very complex  
**[0:27:40-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:40):**  issues and there is still a tendency to try to over-design really complex top-down systems  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:49):**  to solve some of our problems.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:53):**  And for me, this session just brought it back to what's real, which is people sharing stories  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:27:59):**  and people talking about how they feel and sharing their views and offering up a diversity  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:06):**  of meaningful solutions that are specific to the place where they are and the people  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:14):**  who they live among.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:17):**  We can take away from that the importance of a sense of place and the importance of  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:22):**  empowerment of individuals within a community, but also the community within a place in terms  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:29):**  of being able to tackle some of these complex problems.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:33):**  I think Rowan White delivered some amazing soundbite by incredibly articulate.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:42):**  I think the most important thing that she said in summary was what does a culture of  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:46):**  belonging in our food system look like?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:49):**  And I think that's a brilliant lens through which we can reflect back on the whole conference  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:28:56):**  and maybe assess for ourselves the solutions that are proposed and the opinions that are  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:02):**  offered and whether or not they are empowering and whether or not they include everybody  
**[0:29:08-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:08):**  and whether or not they let people feel part of their own food network and food system.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:25):**  By the end of the conference, it was clear that there is a global movement of people  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:29):**  connecting with the land, the soils and all living beings.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:34):**  Other people call that their relationship with Mother Earth, agroecology, regenerative  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:39):**  agriculture.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:41):**  We all have a lot to share and learn from each other.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:45):**  It's going to take great acts of healing and paradigm shifts in mindset to tune into our  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:51):**  collective ancestral brilliance.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021#t=0:29:55):**  And ORFC Global showed we are already on the journey.

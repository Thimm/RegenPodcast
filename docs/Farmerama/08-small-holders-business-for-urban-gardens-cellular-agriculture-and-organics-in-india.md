### Farmerama  (2017-03-10)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmerama as we happily hop into spring. Lots of work to be done in the fields,  although of course the hungry gap is upon us so we won't be seeing the fruits of all  the labour for a few months yet.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:15):**  This month we get into some meaty discussions as we hear from cellular agriculturist Abby  Glencross about her vision for a sustainable farming future.  Anna visits Keats Community Organics to unearth some business tips for urban farmers.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:32):**  And all the way from the Highlands of Scotland we hear from Keisha Crawford-Avis, our newest  contributor.  And finally to India and Rohit Jain, a young Indian entrepreneur and farmer who has rejuvenated  
**[0:00:45-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:45):**  the farming landscape in Udaipur, India.  So first Abby went to visit another Abby, Abby Glencross, Abby G, who's the first  UK funded cellular agriculturist. And she makes animal products. Without any animals.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:03):**  So I work on thick bovine muscle tissue, which is essentially steak. So I grow a steak in  the lab.  Steak in the lab?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:12):**  I'm not really too sure what to make of this, Joe. It's certainly unorthodox. So I don't  really see how this fits in with my vision for a smaller scale farming future.  Well actually Nigel, from Abby G's point of view, she's on the same side as you in the  
**[0:01:30-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:30):**  battle against mass agriculture. Let's have a look and see if she can convince you.  Basically we're fighting the same fight, or we're facing the same challenges, which is  things like economy of scale, of large scale farming, industrial farming. So if we can  
**[0:01:44-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:44):**  work together to get rid of that, then we've both got our own kind of niche markets. It's  not going to get rid of small scale farming. People are always going to want meat. And  actually farming, as you guys know, can be used for land management and biodiversity  
**[0:01:58-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:58):**  and everything like that. So actually if we can connect on that kind of personal level  and realise we're both against the same thing and trying to get rid of the same thing, then  hopefully we'll actually make a difference together.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  I come from a really rural background and I also come from an engineering background  now. And I think that once you realise that science and engineering are in everything  in our society, that in every food we eat, unless you kind of use land that has never  
**[0:02:23-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  been touched and grow from your own seeds sort of thing, it's just every part of it.  People think it's scary because they think there's a load of nutty professors in white  coats playing with life. But actually we're just doing another form of farming. And certain  
**[0:02:41-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  types of farming have evolved over the ages. We never used to farm from the word dot, like  we used to scavenge for our food. So there is this evolution timeline and like cellular  agriculture or like culturing is just another part of that timeline. When industrialisation  
**[0:02:58-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  came in, people thought were horrified and now that unfortunately has become the norm.  So maybe this is like an alternative form, but hopefully it's better for everyone involved  in things like industrialisation.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:12):**  So do you still need animals even when you're growing lab meat? Do you need animals as the  starting point?  Yeah, so we take a muscle biopsy from a cow. My supervisor who makes the burgers showed  
**[0:03:27-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  me the process. We take a biopsy and you must separate out muscle stem cells which are in  the muscle fibres and you multiply them from one to many by just feeding them sort of thing.  But you do need a cow to begin with but it doesn't kill the cow sort of thing. Steak  
**[0:03:45-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  is more complex and I know there's fat involved and capillaries, nervous system, so it is  a work in progress. But tissue engineering to put back into people, that's kind of quite  a developed field as it is, so there's a lot of literature to work from.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:00):**  I still think that a lot of smaller scale farmers would say I just don't understand  how what you're doing is going to benefit me in any way.  And I've totally come up against that too. When I went home some of my friends just wouldn't  
**[0:04:14-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:14):**  speak to me, they didn't want to know. But like I said, they are coming up against big  farms, different types of farming that are alien to them and producing really awful things  for the planet. Even the waste goes into massive cesspools and things like that. So they are  
**[0:04:31-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:31):**  combating that and everyone that I know is involved in cellular agriculture has the drive  to get rid of that large scale polluting, toxic farming that's kind of become the norm.  So like I said, people are always going to eat meat, you're never going to stop everyone  
**[0:04:49-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:49):**  in the world eating meat, so why not take that market, try and reduce it so that just  the small scale farmers doing it right can feed as much of that market as possible and  then we can sort of subsidise that sort of thing rather than these big companies that  
**[0:05:07-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:07):**  we're all fighting against. It could even be used in places that you can't farm as well,  or where like for example in some countries farming on a small scale is people's livelihoods  like entirely and then they'll have a flood or a drought or whatever and their livestock  
**[0:05:23-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:23):**  will die and then they have no way to make money. It's not a country where they will  be supported. So what if you could introduce cellular agriculture as a way that farmers  will always be supported or they can do that themselves as well because they already have  
**[0:05:37-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:37):**  a herd of animals. So maybe in that sense it can be used together as well. It doesn't  have to be us and them either, you can integrate both into the same thing. So I think it's  more diverse than people realise.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:53):**  What do you think Nigel, friend or foe? Would you have a cellular meat lab on your farm?  Maybe fuelled by tissue from one of your heritage heifers?  I'm not convinced Joe. It just seems so far-fetched. It's something out of a science fiction novel  
**[0:06:10-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:10):**  and I would just have to understand the process better to really support something like this  because I think it's... I just don't know what to think.  Find the process and maybe taste it too because that's a big part of this.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  The taste test would be pretty important but also I think it's the ooh, it's grown in a  lab, this is not a natural product. It concerns me that making this stuff from a pastry dish  or something, it just seems very odd and it doesn't stack up. Certainly coming from a  
**[0:06:55-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:55):**  farming tradition of many hundreds of years and this is very new and I just, yeah, I think  I would need to learn more, taste, smell, test it.  But Abby, you were the person who was there speaking to her. What was your take?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  Well I too am very sceptical of lab-grown meat and have been since the beginning because  for me it could be a very dark future of meat being grown in huge labs that are owned by  massive corporations and I just see that as really scary future food. But what I found  
**[0:07:31-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:31):**  really refreshing about Abby G was that she's very open-minded and she's very keen to talk  to smaller scale farmers about how can what she's doing be part of what they see as a  resilient future of food. I think Abby G feels that the technology that she's creating really  
**[0:07:51-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:51):**  doesn't have to go in the more scary direction that we're all thinking in our heads.  I think the scary direction is kind of cool. I can imagine a, I mean I'm not convinced  either right now, but I can see a future where I could find this. Not just okay but exciting.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:13):**  From the lab to the magical remote highlands of Scotland, it's now time to hook up with  Perthshire smallholder Keisha Crawford-Davies. As we found defining farmer is often quite  complex and the definition of a small scale farm is really quite variable. Even in the  
**[0:08:32-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:32):**  UK we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle often. Farmer or grower, smallholder or crofter.  Keisha investigates in this report from the Scottish Smallholder Festival.  This is Keisha. I'm back from a fantastic day at the Scottish Smallholder. One of the  
**[0:08:57-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:57):**  reasons we moved out here to the edge of the highlands was because of how beautiful the  landscape is. But once we're here it's become quite noticeable how remote we really are  and how that actually affects our daily life. So having occasions like the Smallholder Festival  
**[0:09:24-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:24):**  or conference where you are with other people who have similar issues, it just reminds you  that you're part of a much bigger whole. How do you think smallholders differ from farmers?  I think it's really different. I don't like the two labels being separate because I don't  
**[0:09:47-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  think it's just as straightforward as that. And I think that the line is as stretched  as it is. Somebody who farms on a small scale but generally has another income that comes  in. And I think more and more as agriculture is changing, the line that you would draw  
**[0:10:02-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:02):**  in the sand if you want to draw a line between smallholding and farming is actually moving.  More and more farming families are generating income from off-farm. It's interesting you  talking about lines because obviously being in Scotland we've got crofting as well. So  
**[0:10:19-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:19):**  the differences or the similarities actually between crofting and smallholding, are they  one and the same thing but just different from a historical point of view? Yes, well  they are basically the same in many cases. I think the fundamental difference with crofting,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:38):**  apart from the legislative differences, are that the vast majority of crofts are tenanted  whereas the vast majority of smallholdings are owner occupied. And I think that is a  fundamental difference and I think it makes a difference to how they operate. If the First  
**[0:10:54-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  Minister of Scotland was to come and ask me, I think we should simplify the crofting legislation  and I think we should extend it to the whole of Scotland. Where people in the lowlands  can register their properties as being crofts, that would set certain responsibilities on  
**[0:11:10-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:10):**  them in terms of using that land for agriculture, horticulture, forestry. But they would receive  some benefit from that, whether that would be the permission to build a house or access  to loans or whatever. Crofters obviously tend to be much more rural and there are obviously  
**[0:11:33-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  issues if you are in some of these areas of Scotland of connectivity, infrastructure,  access to other services. So there are differences but I think the similarities are actually  greater than the differences.  
**[0:11:48-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  Because I do wonder if sometimes because of these lines it also stops the transfer of  knowledge because I think another difference I would say is that smallholders, a lot of  them are new into farming whereas crofting might have been in the family for generations.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:06):**  I am not saying all smallholders are like that but I just wonder if there is knowledge  within the crofting community that smallholders could really benefit from and likewise the  other way around because of the similar sizes and scales of the operations.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:23):**  I would agree with that. I also think one of the differences between crofters and smallholders  and I don't mean this as a criticism, crofters take themselves much more seriously. My impression  is that they very much recognise the contribution that they make to the communities that they  
**[0:12:42-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:42):**  live and work in whereas smallholders, I don't think we as a group recognise the contributions  that we make in terms of producing local food and access to food and giving people access  to information about food and farming and I think smallholders need to get better.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:12):**  Something that actually came throughout all the talks from improving wildflower meadows  to marketing and selling your business online to permaculture was about encouraging linking  and encouraging linking in a positive way and creating communities, be that creating  
**[0:13:39-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  communities between plants in a permaculture garden or creating communities of people who  are going to transfer skills and knowledge or customers if you're talking about online  marketing but it's all really about encouraging linking and I suppose that's about encouraging  
**[0:14:02-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:02):**  the ecosystem that we live in, that we are a part of. It was a great day and I very much  recommend anyone to come to the one next year and in the meantime if you're in Lanark in  September come along to the smallholders show.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  Keisha actually just got in touch with us on Twitter and made this recording for us  or for you on her phone so if any of you hear something interesting and feel like doing  the same thing then please do talk to us about it or you know Twitter's good or you can email  
**[0:14:43-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:43):**  us through the website as ever our Twitter is at farmerama underscore underscore our  website is farmerama dot co.  Urban farming has taken quite a hammering in recent weeks headlines like is urban farming  
**[0:15:07-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:07):**  only for rich hipsters? No! And the publication in the US of a survey which concluded that  most urban farmers aren't making a living. Kind of a depressing title really.  But closer to home Hannah's been involved with many an urban farm initiative and she's  
**[0:15:24-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:24):**  keen to buck these trends so she headed off to Keats Community Farm in South London and  gleaned three top tips for the urban grower.  First up what about selling plants as well as food to make a bit of extra income?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:38):**  Sorry so Jack was saying they're going to be focusing on selling plants this year as  something new to try and get some income in but it's really good because once you take  those to market if they don't sell you can take them back and then you can try again  
**[0:15:52-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:52):**  or you can use them so you're not getting that waste.  Perfect just keep on repotting them. Yeah so that's the idea to have something that's  kind of lower maintenance and less risk than doing a market store where you just like harvest  
**[0:16:06-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:06):**  loge and loge and take it down. And then potentially you've got a lot to lose.  Tip number two a handy tip for making the most of boxes.  Oh sorry there's some crates behind me. Blue crates and you take them to the rush huts  
**[0:16:25-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:25):**  like that? Yes.  Wicked! Okay. Put a bit of paper underneath. That's a really good idea and then you get  them back. Yeah. So we're always on the scavenge for those.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  Yes. And we just obviously we've never bought any it's just you just see sometimes on a  night out. They're so useful though. Yeah. A massive load by the market. Yeah. So by  using these crates they're not having to like seal up a ton of plastic bags which again  
**[0:16:52-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  cost money isn't very environmentally friendly. And they fit in the fridges they're aerated  they're stuck that's a great solution. Pretty much harvest straight into them so you only  have to handle the salad once or twice. It's actually ended up that we've we've we've  
**[0:17:09-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:09):**  we've harvested into these. But then yeah they're straight into the fridge which is  like you've got to keep it cool you've got to keep it fresh.  When everyone understands the importance of eating seasonally as a grower you need to  
**[0:17:24-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  push this message. But yeah we try to have a real understanding of what people will order  every week you know and try and set up a standing order with them which is basically okay every  week you have this and then Chrissie will also push extra on them every week as well.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:38):**  Good girl. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah because they don't know what's ready or yeah. No  they want to know what's good. Exactly. But basically we picked restaurants that profess  to cook seasonally and sauce locally. Yeah. It's kind of difficult to you know when somebody's  
**[0:17:57-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  calling you up and being like I've heard you guys are really into local produce and we're  a farm that's two miles away I think it's then really difficult for them to be like  turn it down. No. Yeah. We've got a local supplier in Italy. Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  Totally. Yeah.  Hannah now a treasured regular contributor with Jack and Christina with some tips from  the urban farmer at Keats Community Farm. And if you're a grower looking for a bit of  
**[0:18:33-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:33):**  extra support on whatever scale then we can recommend the Capital Growth Network. They  can support you with advice, training, discounts and a wide network of over 2000 gardens and  growers throughout the City of London. Though of course of interest to those of you further  
**[0:18:53-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  afield. And finally we talked to Rohit, a young entrepreneur based near the city of  Udaipur, India who we met in Italy last year. So what's he up to?  We run a farmers club where we have 148 farmers who are working with us and we are collectively  
**[0:19:19-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:19):**  collecting their produce. And also like we like yeah first why we started this because  we want to revive our all the indigenous seeds and indigenous recipes. But what I found if  like farmer will grow all the indigenous seeds and process it when they will get a market.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  So we started a store in Udaipur, it's a city and we connect consumer to farmer so they  get farmers get better price and consumer get a good food. So it's at the local system  where the and no middlemen except that's collective. So farmers sell their all the produce to our  
**[0:19:55-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:55):**  collective and then our collective sell to the consumer and most of farmers are involved  in the processing. Now like we have introduced millets in a different form, in a form like  so we introduce millet cookies, millet punch like you can just add water in that and just  
**[0:20:16-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:16):**  drink for a healthy punch. So that's revived all our indigenous seeds and recipes. So we  are working towards this. They are realizing like through chemicals and all these things  their soil is getting spoiled. So they don't want to do chemical farming. And like after  
**[0:20:32-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:32):**  our collectives and they can come back to their traditional practices and if there will  be any losses but the people will be there to support them. So now they don't have a  fear of getting losses in the farming. So it's a natural. So there will be some disaster,  
**[0:20:52-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:52):**  there will be some losses but it should be community based. So that's why we make a community  for farmers to consumers. So if something happens and something bad happens in the field  so then the consumers should be ready to bear this. A consumer comes like once in a year  
**[0:21:08-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:08):**  and twice in a year to just see how we are doing and to connect also they want to connect  to the farmers like who is growing for them. So that's it. But we have like we have physical  store at CT area so where they can easily find their products.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  And how do you kind of organize that? Is it like through a website or?  No no no no. Although I am a software engineer but yeah we have website but we don't use  website for this. It's just like a phone you call it you come and actually in India I don't  
**[0:21:46-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:46):**  know about the other part of the world but I know about India. The psychology of like  because in India like generally housewives cook for the whole family and yeah. So the  women want to feel their products like how it looks like. So they generally don't prefer  
**[0:22:05-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  to buy all these products from the internet. In metro cities it's prefer. Like Udaipur  is a small town so where women want to see their products and they come and then order.  And yeah most of them order through the phone. They have seen like they have seen our products  
**[0:22:21-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  earlier so they just yeah okay you send this stuff at our place and we have like a person  who supply like who do home delivery. It's our fourth year. We started three years before  like it's fourth year is running. And so we have a store in city city's heart and slowly  
**[0:22:44-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:44):**  slowly like 15 to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 120 and then 250 and now it's reached to 800.  How does it make the farmers feel and yourself being part of the collective? How do you feel?  Young farmers doesn't want to do like don't want to do farming right. And so when we started  
**[0:23:02-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:23:02):**  this consumer like consumer meet go to the farmers and meet so then they realize they  are doing something great so which gives them recognition. So now they are not getting too  much and like it's good for their survival but they are they are ready to do farming  
**[0:23:18-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:23:18):**  because they know that they are doing something for great thing great cause. So that's okay.  It's really great to hear how Rohit is using the power of the cooperative to diversify  and figure out different offerings with the grains they are growing like their millet  
**[0:23:32-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:23:32):**  punch and cookies. I also thought it was interesting the importance of connecting with the consumers  and how that makes young people realize they can really contribute by growing food because  they directly see the value it brings. I'm not sure we say this often enough but thank

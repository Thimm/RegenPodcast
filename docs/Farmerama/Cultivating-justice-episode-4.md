**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:00):**  To neurotypical society, it is important to me that my voice be one of importance. A voice  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:15):**  that is not only heard, but one that is able to create change. It is important to me because  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:21):**  I speak not just for myself, but for a whole community who are having to fight to be listened  
**[0:00:26-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:26):**  to. The autism community. Cultivating Justice, episode 4. We are not the burden that society  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:51):**  has labelled us. We are held back by society because you think differently to us and that  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:00:58):**  scares you. I am here to tell you that it is okay to be afraid, but it is not okay to  
**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:05):**  turn that fear into hate, anger or prejudice. Take your fear, embrace it and understand  
**[0:01:14-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:14):**  it, overcome it and use it to learn to educate yourself. It is not about what we are lacking,  
**[0:01:23-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:23):**  it is about the tools that society is lacking to accommodate our neurodivergent minds. We  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:31):**  are not the first minority community to have to fight for our rights and we won't be the  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:35):**  last. These battles are ongoing and seem to be indefinite, but the world should not be  
**[0:01:42-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:42):**  this way. No one should have to fight to be treated fairly. Stand up for autistic rights.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome to Cultivating Justice. Before we start this episode, a heads up that it includes  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:01:56):**  references to anxiety, depression, grief and experiences of ableism, as well as descriptions  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:02):**  of self-harm and autism meltdown. Please take care as you listen. And just to let you know,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:08):**  there are also a few swear words in this one. I'm Hester Russell and I'm a grower and organiser  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:14):**  for Out on the Land or UTL. I'm also involved in a new and emergent union of land-based  
**[0:02:19-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:19):**  employees. And I'm Zoe Miles. I use they them pronouns. I'm a grower too, also part of UTL  
**[0:02:27-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:27):**  and I'm part of the same emerging union. The music you're hearing right now is a track  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:41):**  called Beautiful Gizzard by Jazzbutt, aka Guess and Harry Biles. It's made from recordings  
**[0:02:47-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:02:47):**  of a wormery and a compost heap in East London. And the clips we heard at the start of this  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:00):**  episode are taken from An Open Letter to Neuro-Typical Society, written by Natalie Tamborini. You  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:07):**  can find the full letter in the show notes for this episode and we'd really, really encourage  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:11):**  you to read it. We're going to hear more from Natalie in a moment. She'll be talking about  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:19):**  an experience she had when she was working on a farm and she'll also be sharing some  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:23):**  of her ideas to make farms and workplaces in general more just, accessible and inclusive.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:29):**  We'll also be hearing from Maggie Chaney of Rocksteady Farm in upstate New York. Maggie  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:33):**  will be talking about how they put care at the centre of their work and how doing that  
**[0:03:38-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:38):**  can be one way of querying our approach to land work.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:03:59):**  Feedback is a campaign group that's working to regenerate nature by transforming our food  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:04):**  systems. One of their projects is something called EcoTalent. It's an internship scheme  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:09):**  for young people who are passionate about the environment but feel that their background  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:14):**  or their life experience is stopping them from getting jobs in the environmental or  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:18):**  food sectors. Katie from Farmerama first came across the EcoTalent scheme at a COP26 Fringe  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:24):**  event. At this event, EcoTalent interns were sharing the experiences they'd had on the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:29):**  scheme and the ideas they'd come up with to improve the food system.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:33):**  One of the presentations was a video testimony from Natalie who we heard at the start of  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:38):**  this episode. It left a real impression on Katie so we asked Natalie to share her story  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:43):**  with us as part of Cultivating Justice.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:46):**  My name is Natalie. I'm 26 years old. I am autistic and I'm also non-binary so I'm part  
**[0:04:57-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:04:57):**  of the LGBTQ community as well as the Neurodivergent community. I am an advocate for the rights  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:08):**  and needs being met for autistic people.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:12):**  How did you get involved with Feedback and specifically with the EcoTalent project?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:17):**  So I wasn't in work. I could not find work that was autism friendly or able to meet my  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:25):**  needs specifically but also I didn't really know much about my needs either so it was  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:29):**  like they needed me to help them but I couldn't. So I wasn't actively looking for work or anything.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:37):**  I thought I'm just not supposed to be in the world of work and I had come to terms with  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:41):**  that. But I was scrolling through Facebook and I saw an advert for an internship for  
**[0:05:48-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:48):**  young adults in my age group who didn't need any prior experience, didn't need a CV and  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:05:57):**  specifically was aimed towards young people who had barriers that were like stopping them  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:04):**  from entering the world of work. I was like I've never heard of any internship or any  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:10):**  job that describes me so well so that's what really drew me and I was like I have to go  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:14):**  for this. I don't care what the job is. I'm going to go for this because they could really  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:18):**  open some doors for me. Just help me out, you know, get into some mainstream work or  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:23):**  something. So I was just like let's do it and then yeah I've got an email back saying  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:28):**  that they wanted to interview me and it was for a job on a farm. Now I've never really  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:32):**  had any interest in like, well not really interest, like I've never really thought about  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:36):**  it. When my food is produced or farming or anything like that. I live in London. It didn't  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:43):**  even occur to me that there were farms in London. So I was just like okay this is interesting.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:49):**  I like animals so can't be too hard right? And then I got the job.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:06:57):**  How did you feel when you found out that you'd got that job? Can you just tell us a bit about  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:01):**  that moment?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:03):**  I was ecstatic. I have never been prouder of myself in my whole entire life because  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:10):**  I just come to the conclusion that I'll never be able to enter the world of work and I'll  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:16):**  just have to be on benefits for the rest of my life. And it seemed like a quite bleak  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:20):**  and quite sort of down and out future. Like you know there is nothing to strive for, there  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:26):**  is nothing to work towards because no one wants to employ me. And then feedback just  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:30):**  came along and was like you got the job. I was like I cannot believe it. Cannot believe.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:37):**  Tell us what actually happened then when you started the job.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:42):**  So the first day was a bit of a shit show. I should have gone to the farm before my first  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:48):**  day. I should have been introduced to the staff and told exactly what my timetable was  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:54):**  going to be, what time I was going to eat lunch, what time I had to arrive and what  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:07:57):**  the process is. You know once you get through the gates in the morning this is where you  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:00):**  have to report to and this is what you're going to be expected to do. You know what  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:04):**  I mean like some sort of introduction to the job. I didn't know I needed that at the time  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:10):**  so I didn't ask for it. So when I first showed up my anxiety disorder kicked in because my  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:16):**  autism was screaming at me. You know there is no structure, you don't know who you're  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:21):**  meant to be working with, you don't know what's expected of you and I had a panic attack.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:26):**  So I ran back to my car and I drove home and cried. In my head I was like I knew this was  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:33):**  going to happen, I knew I was going to fuck it up. So I felt really crap about myself  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:37):**  you know. And then I spoke to James and he was like it was set up bad.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:43):**  Just to note that James is James Turner, Feedback to Project Manager.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:47):**  He was sorry, we were all sorry for each other and he was like but I really want this to  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:51):**  work and I was like I didn't want to give up, I really wanted this to work. So me, James  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:08:57):**  really worked together to work out a plan. The plan that me and James came up with was  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:02):**  communicated to the manager of the farm and the manager of the farm agreed. But when I  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:07):**  went on my new start date she hadn't actually put anything in place for me, what we agreed  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:13):**  on. There was no consideration at all in terms of my needs and it was just as hard as the  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:21):**  first day that I had a panic attack. There was no structure, you know I remember on the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:26):**  first day it was home time but I didn't know it was home time. No one had told me, Natalie  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:32):**  this is the time you're finishing. And then the manager came up to me and she was like  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:37):**  what are you still doing here? And I was like you told me to clean out the chickens, I'm  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:40):**  doing what you instructed me to do. Well it's time for you to go home, so go on. And it  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:46):**  was like so abrupt, like there's no transition. I need transition time. And that was every  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:52):**  day. Most of what I go through is I would say quite commonplace. Like I know every autistic  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:09:58):**  person is different but we do share some traits and I think mine was quite well known traits  
**[0:10:04-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:04):**  as autism can go. I was actually unwell while I was working at the farm. For about three  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:14):**  weeks I'd been going to the hospital and having biopsies and stuff. I was not eating properly  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:20):**  or drinking properly. I'd just gone through a grievance. My cousin unfortunately passed  
**[0:10:27-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:27):**  away. So all of that plus working you know eight o'clock till whatever it was, I can't  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:37):**  even remember now, doing like manual labour on the farm. And I was just mentally and physically  
**[0:10:43-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:43):**  exhausted. I was pushing myself and pushing myself. And this one day I was tired. I'd  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:52):**  had enough with the manager, like really had enough. I had been given a project to do that  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:10:58):**  was about four days long. I had to clear out this barn, paint the walls, jet wash the floor  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:05):**  and repaint the floor. It was my job and I was so proud of it. It was mainly me on my  
**[0:11:11-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:11):**  own sorting out this barn and it looked amazing when I was almost done. And so four days on  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:20):**  a trot I was doing that job. It was very clear to me what needed to be done. I loved it.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:26):**  It really, yeah, itched the right spots in my autism. Like it was everything I needed.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:31):**  And then on the last day I was so almost done. Like I had maybe an eighth left to do and  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:39):**  I'd been working on this floor for about three days straight. And then the manager came in  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:44):**  and she was like, oh, you're doing amazing. I was like, thank you. She was like, but you  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:49):**  don't need to do this last bit. I said, sorry? She's like, you've been working too long on  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:55):**  this project. I want you to leave it now. Just like that. So abrupt, you know, you're  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:11:59):**  leaving the barn, you're not to finish the job. And I just, I shut down. She left and  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:11):**  I just stood there, couldn't move. I was stuck in transition mode. Like I have to finish,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:18):**  I have to finish, I have to finish. But then my autism's like, you have to listen to the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:23):**  authority. So it's like, I just was frozen. I was frozen for about 25 minutes, stuck in  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:30):**  the same spot, like a solid block of ice and just crying to myself. I was like, do you  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:35):**  know what? You do not care about me. And you've made that very clear. You don't care what  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:40):**  my autism means for me. You don't want to put the time in to learn about what my autism  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:44):**  means for me. And you've made that perfectly clear. I now have no respect for you. I was  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:49):**  done at that point with her. But I still worked on the farm, right? So a few days down the  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:12:54):**  line, I was working with my colleague and he was great. I mean, we really got along.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:00):**  He had a really bad day. I still don't know what it was about, but he had such a short  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:04):**  fuse. We was in a muddy field and the job was to clear out this shed, but I was physically  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:12):**  done. I couldn't even lift the wheelbarrow out of the mud. So I didn't really tell anyone  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:18):**  that I was ill. So that's my bad. And I didn't tell him that I was grieving as well. Maybe  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:24):**  I should have in hindsight. But anyway, so yeah, I just didn't have the strength to carry  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:27):**  this wheelbarrow and he's getting really frustrated with me. He's like, if you don't want to be  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:31):**  here, go home. I'm shaking with exhaustion. And now I'm just angry and I don't care now.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:40):**  So we had a fallout and I could feel a buildup and I was like, oh, I know this buildup. An  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:50):**  autism meltdown is coming and I am not in the place to be having an autism meltdown  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:13:56):**  right now. I was so upset. I couldn't breathe. I was crying so hard. I ran to the car park  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:05):**  and then I realised I left my cardigan in the field with my car keys in. It's starting  
**[0:14:11-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:11):**  to rain. So I just sat on the gravel against my tyre of my car in the rain and just cried.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:24):**  I must've been crying really loud. I tend to do that when I'm in a meltdown. I'm not  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:29):**  really thinking about how I'm presenting to everyone else. I'm just in the moment, you  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:33):**  know? So my manager comes out of course and she's like, Natalie, you can't be behaving  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:40):**  like this. Someone's going to see. When I'm in a meltdown, I cannot verbally communicate.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:48):**  I cannot use my words. I'm not really thinking either. It's like, I'm not in control of my  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:14:54):**  body really. Yeah. My meltdowns can be quite rough in the sense that I will be trigger  
**[0:15:02-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:02):**  warning. I will be punching my thighs. I will be hitting my head. I could be kicking the  
**[0:15:12-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:12):**  floor kind of, screaming and then just crying and stuff. My meltdowns can look brutal. It  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:20):**  can look like I'm in some really deep stress, which I am, you know? And I am nonverbal.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:25):**  I cannot communicate with you when I'm in a full meltdown. And honestly, I can't really  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:30):**  follow instructions or anything like that. As I say, I'm not really in control of my  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:35):**  body, right? So she's telling me that I should leave the car park and go inside. But that's  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:42):**  just not doable. I'm here now. I'm having the meltdown and she starts grabbing my arms,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:48):**  my wrists. She's like, come on, we have to go inside. People can't see this. She was  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:52):**  embarrassed of me. The rules are you do not touch me when I'm having a meltdown at all.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:15:58):**  You don't try and move me unless I'm in a place of danger, you know, which I wasn't.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:03):**  And she's like, stop crying. This is ridiculous. Why are you crying like this? And then she  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:08):**  starts threatening with, if you don't calm down right now, I'm going to call the ambulance.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:13):**  Not my parents, the ambulance. Now, the problem with this, right, is if an ambulance comes  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:20):**  and they see me in this distressful state and she doesn't say anything, they're not  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:25):**  going to think autism. Why would that be their first guess? They'll think this is a mental  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:29):**  health disorder that we can't deal with this. The police are going to have to deal with  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:32):**  this. So then what will happen next is they call the police. This whole situation has  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:36):**  now become absolutely terrifying. I've heard of stories of autistic people having meltdowns  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:43):**  and the police have restrained them so hard that they've suffocated them. And they've  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:48):**  died in the hands of the police because they're having a meltdown. It just scared the absolute  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:53):**  living daylights out of me. I don't know how I managed it. And I can't even remember how  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:16:57):**  it got there. But my phone was on the floor and I managed to press like one button or  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:02):**  something and my dad's mobile was being called from my phone. So he could hear the commotion,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:10):**  me screaming, her shouting and all this. I just let him hear what was going on, hoping,  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:19):**  hoping that he would just come and save me. And yeah, and then 15 minutes later, my dad  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:27):**  and his beamer comes running into the car. I was like, yes. That's when I really let  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:32):**  go. So my parents sat down on the floor with me and rode it out with me. After I calmed  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:40):**  down, I got into my dad's car. We sat for a little bit and then my colleague who shouted  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:44):**  at me earlier came over and he was like, I'm so sorry, Nathalie. He's like, I am having  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:48):**  a bad day. And I did take it out on you a little bit. He was like, don't leave. Please  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:52):**  come back to the farm tomorrow. I was like, no, yeah, I will. I will come back. No, I  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:17:58):**  didn't go back. I got into office work instead, which is so much better.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:06):**  What are some of the things that your employer could have done differently?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:10):**  Things that could have gone differently is me, my feedback manager and the farm manager  
**[0:18:17-0:18:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:17):**  could have all had a meeting together specifically about what my autism means for me of what  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:25):**  I knew at that point. What could be put in place to help assist and accommodate to make  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:33):**  my job doable? Not just autism, you know, my anxiety disorder as well and depression.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:40):**  Those things play a real big part in what I'm able to do day to day. Yeah, and then  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:45):**  just sit and work together and work out exactly what needs to be done. But even if we did  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:49):**  do that, somehow I feel like it still wouldn't have worked because every single person would  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:55):**  need to be on board. So it's not just about what accommodations could be put in place.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:18:59):**  It's also about the people you're working with. You know, if the people are ignorant  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:03):**  and don't want to learn or want to support, then they're not going to and you're not going  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:08):**  to have those things put in place, no matter how much you beg. Which is discrimination,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:13):**  you know, and it is totally against the Equality Act 2010. But unless you do report them or  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:20):**  do something about it, nothing's going to change, you know what I mean? The thing is,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:23):**  I didn't have the knowledge back then. I think that is such an important thing to keep saying.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:30):**  There was something that you mentioned in your video testimony, which I think was called  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:37):**  the Pi Plan. Can you tell us a bit about that? What is the Pi Plan?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:42):**  When I was working at Feedback, Feedback were really interested in how they could do better  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:46):**  to support autistic colleagues or anyone who they're going to end up working with who are  
**[0:19:52-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:19:52):**  autistic. And I invented this system where if they employed someone who is autistic,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:02):**  they could use this thing called the Pi Plan, which is Personal Inclusion and Equity Plan.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:08):**  The autistic colleague and their manager will sit together with this form. And it's a contract  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:17):**  basically that the employer agrees to put in these set accommodations that the autistic  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:24):**  person needs. And they will write it all down. So the employer can't say, oh, well, you didn't  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:29):**  mention that it's there in black and white on paper. And it will have emergency contacts  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:34):**  written down so they can't threaten with ambulances and shit. It will have agreed adaptions, provisions  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:41):**  and alternative communication methods that the autistic person needs. What to do in the  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:46):**  case of a meltdown or sensory overload, what to do in the case of a shutdown. The autistic  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:52):**  colleague can give permission of who can view that document. Can it be just the managers  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:20:57):**  or can it be colleagues as well, or even external organisations, things like that. And then  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:03):**  there can be set dates of when the Pi Plan will be reviewed. Because obviously, if the  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:10):**  autistic person doesn't know their needs, they can learn as they go along on the job  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:15):**  and say, oh, I need to add this, or I don't need this anymore, you can change that. And  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:19):**  then eventually you'll get to a full, clear understanding of what adaptations are needed  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:26):**  and what to do to help support the autistic person. And then the manager or managers don't  
**[0:21:34-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:34):**  have an excuse to let that autistic person down. I think people really forget that just  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:45):**  because we are autistic, we are capable of critical thinking. Just really, please listen  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:21:54):**  to actually autistic people and actually autistic voices.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:22:24):**  Zoe, how did you feel hearing from Natalie?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah, I mean, I remember when I first heard it, just being stunned as it unfolded. Just  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:22:48):**  being like, oh my god, Natalie's been through so much during an internship that posed itself  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:22:55):**  as being so positive and inclusive.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:22:58):**  It's so clear from her reaction to getting that job, how rare an opportunity that is.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:04):**  And so then for it to be so disappointing was really, really hard to hear. But I think  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:13):**  what really comes out of that is that not only do we need active diversity positive  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:20):**  recruitment in our sector, which is so diverse in so many ways across all sorts of intersections.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:26):**  Simply like recruiting people isn't enough, you also need to have the functioning accommodations  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:32):**  and there's work to put in and there's care to put in.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:36):**  Absolutely. I think that the lack of consideration for what makes a workplace sustainable for  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:40):**  humans to work in, it's really neglected.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, I think there's sort of an expectation that you're fit, strong, fast, healthy, you're  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:51):**  not going to take many sick days or holiday days or there's just such a toxic culture  
**[0:23:57-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:23:57):**  of needing to be fit in all ways, which is so unrealistic. And we really need to build  
**[0:24:05-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:05):**  resilience into our sector in terms of the people that comes from creating enabling environments.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:15):**  And there's this whole idea maybe in farming that economic pressures mean that you can't  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:20):**  make those accommodations, but that's such a cop out.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:24):**  Totally. This culture of overworking for the good cause. I mean, I think that's the idea  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:30):**  and it permits a lot of bad boss behavior as well. Like how Natalie's manager was so  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:37):**  unaccountable to anyone and was able to abuse power so horribly, even with that policy in  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:44):**  place that James and Natalie had figured out together.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, I think that being a slightly informal workplace, not quite clear expectations and  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:24:55):**  sort of blurred relationships, which are both professional and unprofessional, can lead  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:02):**  to some really complicated situations. And I think having clear expectations laid out,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:10):**  having a contract, having a really clear job description, little things like that, which  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:15):**  are just normal in the working world, but apparently not normal in agroecological farming,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:22):**  just can prevent so many issues. And also I think that sort of brings us on a bit to  
**[0:25:29-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:29):**  the need for a union for employees and other people working on the land who aren't landowners  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:37):**  or bosses, because there's nowhere to go with those issues at the moment. I think it's really  
**[0:25:42-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:42):**  important to create some benchmarks and some frameworks for discussing these issues and  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:50):**  to try and create some change. Do you want to explain a bit, though, about what the union  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:56):**  is and where it's at?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:25:57):**  Sure. Yeah. So a bunch of people have been talking for many years about the need for  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:05):**  collectivization of workers in the growing and farming sector. Specifically, I'm thinking  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:12):**  of the good food sector, because that's where I'm working. There are networking organizations  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:20):**  already in place, like the Land Workers Alliance and the Organic Growers Alliance, but there's  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:25):**  none so far that focus on workers' rights. A lot of people are starting to feel frustrated  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:32):**  with the sustainable food sector because it's not sustainable to work within. Rates of pay  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:37):**  aren't fair often. Often there's an overreliance on volunteer labor. There's often way too  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:43):**  much experience needed for very poorly paid or poor-conditioned jobs. And there's a lot  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:48):**  that we can do about it when we collectively act, but not a lot we can do about it when  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:52):**  we're individuals. So at the moment, we're at the stage of genuinely just gathering people.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:26:58):**  We don't have a formal name yet. That will be coming soon. And we also don't have a public  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:27:03):**  speaking policy yet. And I'm speaking on behalf of myself. I'm part of the coordinating group,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:27:09):**  which is still open to be joined by anyone. If you're interested, and this could be relevant  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:27:14):**  to you, like in the show notes, there's a way to get in touch. We're at the stage where  
**[0:27:19-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:27:19):**  we're having regular meetings and figuring out how to build power together.  
**[0:27:35-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:27:35):**  Inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside. Last night, inside, you dreamt you  
**[0:28:00-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:28:00):**  were a butterfly. Outside, inside, outside, inside, outside, outside, outside, outside,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:28:20):**  outside. Inside, inside. Inside. Inside. Inside. All of a sudden, you are you, with all your  
**[0:28:48-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:28:48):**  Now, you don't know whether you are you, who dreams they are a butterfly, or a butterfly  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:12):**  who dreams they are you.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:16):**  Inside, inside, outside.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:41):**  That was a clip from a performance by artist Sin Wai Kin commissioned by the Queer Ecologies  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:46):**  Collective.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:53):**  Maggie Chaney is the general manager and one of the co-founders of Rocksteady Farm.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:29:58):**  Rocksteady is a queer-run cooperative vegetable farm in upstate New York.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:03):**  It's rooted in social justice, food access and farmer training.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:07):**  Maggie's been involved with food and farming for their whole life in urban and rural settings,  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:12):**  and they've been involved in so many great projects.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:15):**  Sam Siver from Land in Our Names spoke to Maggie about the role of care in land work  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:19):**  and in work more generally.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:21):**  Sam started by asking Maggie whether centering care could be one way that we queer the ways  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:26):**  we relate to work and to each other.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:29):**  Our staff were 100% queer and trans, so all of us come with needs that might be a little  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:38):**  bit more, I don't know, heightened than a farm that might have all cis white folks who  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:46):**  are men.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:48):**  In the United States, there are so many structural layers that are against BIPOC people and  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:30:54):**  queer and trans folks that just baseline we're coming into a space that are filled with people  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:01):**  who have more needs in general.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:04):**  And I think as Rocksteady has kind of gone on its path, we're in our seventh year, that's  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:10):**  been very apparent that there are layers to how we support our staff that are above and  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:16):**  beyond maybe a space that has less kind of layered identities.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:22):**  So in that way, the querying of our farm is providing the care that we think people need.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:29):**  And given that people that are in our team are very biracial, like multi-class, multi-gendered  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:34):**  space.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:36):**  And I think in general, queer folks tend to center care and mutual aid a little bit more  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:44):**  than other people.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:47):**  I think that's a wonderful thing about queer people is that often we haven't been able  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:51):**  to find our needs met in mainstream society.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:54):**  So we've had to create mutual aid systems in all different ways.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:31:58):**  So that's just a part of our culture because of who works for us.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:04):**  Everyone is a little bit more tuned into that type of support where we support each other,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:09):**  we find resources that other people have, we network our communities.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:14):**  But then there's also just like a heightened awareness that care is just very important,  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:22):**  just to kind of be okay in the world.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:24):**  Like our baseline just needs more support generally.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:29):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:30):**  And that's not to say that people who are not queer also don't need the same support.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:35):**  I think that everyone in agriculture should get more support because it's really a difficult  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:41):**  field of work.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:42):**  It's incredibly challenging.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:44):**  So I think that there's a lot of learning that can be had from the way that we do it  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:48):**  at Rocksteady that is very much applicable to any workplace in agriculture or not.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:32:55):**  There's also like a lot of work that we do around creating a healthy work environment,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:05):**  which feels safe for people to communicate their needs both for themselves, but also  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:14):**  for how they want to handle conflicts or just in general.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:20):**  Like if we're also working with people who have a lot of different learning styles and  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:26):**  possibly learning differences and overlapping with communication that we have to do on an  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:32):**  ongoing basis as a collective.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:35):**  And like with our farm, we're doing loads of communication.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:39):**  You know, we're very team oriented and there's lots of different managers and it's a complex  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:46):**  project.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:47):**  So there's so many ways that there can be miscommunications and conflicts.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:52):**  And I don't invest in any farm, conflicts just happen.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:33:56):**  So we put a lot of energy into trying to give people more skills essentially to try to communicate  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:04):**  with each other and then also defining as a group what is supportive, safe communication  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:11):**  look like, what is the workplace culture look like to people, what are the important values  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:16):**  that we all hold and we want to uplift.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:18):**  So we do work with outside facilitators to support that work.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:22):**  And as a farm, that's important because I think there are a lot of people who want that  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:28):**  type of workspace but don't necessarily have the skills internally to do it themselves,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:34):**  especially if it's a production farm, which is incredibly stressful and very tightly time  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:41):**  managed.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:42):**  There is an assumption that you just do not have time to do anything other than production.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:50):**  And I've definitely been in that place myself as a farmer.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:55):**  There have been moments where you're just like, I do not have time to deal with this  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:34:59):**  conflict.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:00):**  And so we're trying to create a culture which invites people to address conflicts as soon  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:07):**  as possible and feel like they have the skills to do that and they have the time to do that  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:10):**  and they have support if they need it so that things don't get put off and then explode  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:16):**  at some other point in the future.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:18):**  So it's been really well worth it for us to dive so deep into this work with the outside  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:25):**  facilitators.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:26):**  Yeah, and I feel like people really lean in to the work that we're doing with them as  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:32):**  the Relational Uprising is the organization that we work with.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:36):**  And I think for them, that feels like a form of care.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:40):**  And it's like, oh, you really care about my well-being at this farm and show that care  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:49):**  by like paying for people to get training and facilitation and group process and storytelling  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:35:56):**  and all these things that kind of build relationship resiliency because we just want the whole  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:02):**  system to be healthier.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:05):**  And I think a lot of farmers put energy towards the health of the farm, especially in sustainable  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:12):**  agriculture.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:13):**  The narrative is like soil health and ecological practices and climate safe, everything.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:20):**  But that is like completely undone if your humans are unhealthy and hurt.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:30):**  Like I just don't think that they should be separated.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:33):**  So I think that's a hard decision for farmers to make to put actual funding and finances  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:39):**  into that work.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:41):**  But the same way that we are like making calls about what tractor we should get or implement  
**[0:36:47-0:36:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:47):**  we should buy or if we need to pay for a particular lawyer for something, like the same way we're  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:36:57):**  really, really prioritizing the facilitators that we work with and paying them well and  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:02):**  paying our staff well and paying for like amazing lunches during that time to just kind  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:08):**  of balance it all out.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:11):**  And I think especially for like not just farm workers but also farm managers and owners,  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:17):**  right?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:18):**  There's this perception that if you're someone who's at the higher end of a hierarchy or  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:22):**  an owner that you can just do it all.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:25):**  And oftentimes those folks are really struggling mentally because of the stress of the position  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:32):**  they're on and they can inflict the most harm because of the power that they hold.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:37):**  And if that's not addressed and they're not getting the support that they need, that's  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:41):**  creating a very unhealthy system.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:44):**  And I think outside facilitation can support the people in power so that they can hold  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:49):**  that power responsibly and not put harm on the people who are within the farm, which  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:54):**  is like incredibly important.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:37:59):**  It's so nice to hear about places that are really putting care at the heart of what they  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:09):**  do.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:10):**  Yeah, it sounds like a really great place to work, first of all.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:15):**  What I really appreciate about what we've just heard is that Rocksteady sounds like  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:21):**  it will have still challenges to work there.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:24):**  I'm sure.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:25):**  I don't think any workplace does, but there are ways to hold people accountable who have  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:30):**  more power within that system for people with less power.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:34):**  And I think that's really central to care in a workplace.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:38):**  Yeah, I think that just putting resources into care, what Maggie's been describing is  
**[0:38:43-0:38:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:43):**  just so unusual in workplaces in a capitalist system.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:51):**  We talked earlier a lot about workers and how to put care into that system and sustainability  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:38:55):**  into that system for workers, but it's also about the farm owners and managers who are  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:02):**  under loads of stress and actually how they need to care for themselves.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:10):**  And if the people at the top aren't doing that, then there's not going to be that example  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:16):**  for everyone to follow or feel enabled to work according to their needs.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:22):**  And I feel like there's so many burnt out, overworked farmers out there.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:26):**  Totally.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:27):**  I'm just nodding along the whole time right now.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:29):**  We're expecting all of us to burn out on cycle and get sick.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:33):**  Whereas if bosses and managers are affirmed that they also need to be taken care of and  
**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:39):**  respected, their energy and time respected for needing rest and a life outside of this,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:46):**  that's beneficial for all of us.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:47):**  And it means that this work is inclusive of more people who want to do it, including me.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:53):**  I don't want to give up the rest of my life for this anymore.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:39:56):**  I think it's also about the stories we tell in Landwork and what we put on the pedestal.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:00):**  There's a bad culture of being like, oh, who's worked the most hours and who's the most tired?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:07):**  And actually we should be celebrating a business model that supports work-life balance or that  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:14):**  integrates rest or farmers that manage to take two weeks holiday in the summer.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:20):**  That's great.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:22):**  It's just changing that lens a bit.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:25):**  I think for a lot of people, the food system we want to see does involve a lot more labor.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:30):**  And for that to be possible and true, this labor should be well compensated and it should  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:35):**  involve enough rest.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:38):**  Not enough rest that you can just get back on the horse the next, not literal horse,  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:41):**  just to burst anyone's bubble, unless you're really lucky, you probably won't be on a real  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:45):**  horse.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:46):**  You just have to get back on your knees usually and harvest some more chard the next day.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:50):**  This work is appealing in theory and in practice.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:53):**  It can really squish you down if it doesn't take into account that you still have needs.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:40:59):**  So much of this work is about changing a system and still actually in reality fitting totally  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:06):**  within it, being as productive as possible and giving our labor and time fully to this  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:11):**  work.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:12):**  There are so many people interested in this work and there's so many people who have visions  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:16):**  of wanting this work to be good.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:18):**  Surely there's enough energy there and enough people wanting to shift how we do work in  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:24):**  general and sustainable food related work that we could collectively figure out more  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:30):**  solutions to these problems because they're the same.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:33):**  Farms like Rock Steady are already giving great examples of how we can address some  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:38):**  of these problems.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:39):**  And there's organizations that are set up that we're often in contact with that can  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:43):**  actually help facilitate this.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:45):**  So yeah, basically I think there's a lot of collective problem solving that can happen  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:49):**  and the networks are already in place and the solutions are even there.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:41:53):**  It's just about making us together feel like we are allowed to start trying them.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:00):**  Obviously we're in this capitalist system where you do have to produce enough to stay  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:05):**  afloat and you do have to sell your veg, but also there are creative solutions and there  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:12):**  are ways that we can try and build in care and rest into our systems where we can.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:18):**  And it's a process and it's just that thing of not getting blindsided by economics and  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:26):**  busyness of the season and forgetting the people, I guess.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:31):**  So listening to Maggie, it's just really inspiring to hear about how they're really enacting  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:39):**  that there.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:40):**  And I'd like to see more of that across farms in the UK and everywhere.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:45):**  I totally agree with that.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:46):**  I think challenging burnout culture and putting in place ways that we can work out solutions  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:53):**  that don't keep that cycle going, it's also to the advantage of an organization to be  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:42:59):**  able to retain their workers.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:01):**  It's caring for your organization as well.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:04):**  I honestly think that it's the thing that's been missed out of the conversation amongst  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:08):**  so much of the sustainable food and farming sector in the UK.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:13):**  It's like, how can this work be good for all of us in the long term, not just for the environment?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:18):**  Care isn't, obviously isn't just a queer thing, but actually queer communities are  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:25):**  a really great place to learn from.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:30):**  There's so many networks of mutual aid and support.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:33):**  And actually, that's a really great thing that I feel like the rest of society could  
**[0:43:38-0:43:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:38):**  get some takeaways from.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:43:53):**  I'm affirmed when I see individuals like myself taking up space.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:01):**  My affirmation is not personal on my own individual merits.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:06):**  If I see one of my trans sibs thriving in horticulture and schooling people on pronunciation,  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:14):**  that for me is affirming.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:17):**  I think community has helped me with the affirmation that we're on the right path.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:24):**  Sometimes it feels like a disarray, sometimes it's manic, but community is definitely the  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:30):**  affirming party.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:34):**  My queer identity interacts with my relationship to the living world in the sense that queer  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:45):**  to me means really that I don't really relate to the world as a binary place, you know,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:51):**  with a right and a wrong and a male and a female.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:44:57):**  Yeah, it's more, it's more blurry than that, isn't it?  
**[0:45:04-0:45:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:04):**  Yeah, I guess I don't, I don't accept this mainstream sort of society's version of the  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:16):**  normative personally.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:22):**  And I think that my queer identity really kind of forces me to question assumptions  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:30):**  around those things often, which is, I think, really, really important.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:37):**  Yeah, I think nature is exactly the same.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:42):**  It's really diverse, really fucking queer, which is great.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:50):**  I think like queer individuals, plants develop in ways that sometimes have stars to talk.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:45:57):**  Not all plants adhere to the binaries, not all plants do what we expect them to do.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:02):**  But we're not just talking plants, we're talking non-human beings, nature, everything.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:08):**  And I just think, you know, if you're ever as a queer person feeling, you know, that  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:17):**  you're too queer, that you're too something, that society doesn't really want you to be,  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:24):**  then basically you can just look at nature and it'll be doing it.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:30):**  It'll have been doing it for, you know, trillions of years.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:34):**  So it's kind of old news for nature.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:38):**  I just think once you start to explore nature, the natural world is, it's just really naturally  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:45):**  out and proud.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:46):**  And well, that's just, that's just great, isn't it?  
**[0:46:50-0:47:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-4#t=0:46:50):**  I think that's great.

### Farmerama  (2020-13-17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:00):**  So there are two different kind of breads, multi-grain breads.  We've made multi-grain breads, we've made just wholemeal bread.  Hello, hello, hello. Testing, testing. One, two, three.  Can I get you to start that again?  Hello, hello, hello.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:13):**  Yeah, yeah, no, sorry. That's what you were made.  Today we've made multi-grain and wholemeal bread.  Shortbread, cinnamon buns, rolls, muffins, tea.  That's about it now, yeah? Have we made anything else?  I'm a wee near shortcake. All during the afternoon.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:35):**  We've got quite a few regulars that just buy religiously  every Wednesday or every Friday.  So yeah, they've been faithful since we've started.  I started the High Rise Bakers.  Welcome to cereal from Farmerama.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:57):**  This is a bonus episode about Glasgow's High Rise Bakers.  Can I talk to you a little bit?  What are you making?  I'm making chai. This is Sudan chai.  I'm making this one, cardamom, cinnamon.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:20):**  After bringing ginger one minute, I come and...  Can you make them together?  One second.  We're in the Gorbils, a neighbourhood just south of the River Clyde in Glasgow.  And more specifically, we're in a small community kitchen  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:37):**  on the ground floor of a high-rise block of flats.  The kitchen is normally used by a youth club,  but two days a week it becomes a bakery,  home to the High Rise Bakers.  The bakery was set up by Bridging the Gap,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:52):**  a local charity that supports the community of the Gorbils  in a range of different ways.  I'm Katrina Milligan.  I'm a project worker at Bridging the Gap,  and part of my job is the privilege of running High Rise Bakers.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:06):**  So High Rise Bakers is a group of local people.  About half of the bakers are from a refugee background.  Some people are local and a refugee background.  And we come together twice a week  to bake really delicious, nutritious bread for our neighbours.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:21):**  We sell it in the community and other baked goods as well.  So it was started as a way of bringing people in who live at the margins  and who maybe couldn't take part in some of our events,  which have much larger numbers of people.  So it's something that builds community and builds relationships,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:40):**  but it's also something that's purposeful to do.  So for quite a lot of the people who come,  they're not able to hold down paid employment,  maybe because of health reasons  or because of home office regulations.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:52):**  So it gives something meaningful to do that serves their community  and enhances life around here.  Early on, one of the things that one of our customers said is that  the foyer of the High Rise used to smell of piss  and now it smells of freshly baked bread,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:10):**  which I thought was a massive compliment.  One of Bridging the Gap's initiatives is called Big Thursdays.  These are drop-in events with discussions and family activities,  as well as a shared meal.  And it was at Big Thursdays that the idea for High Rise bakers  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:39):**  began to take shape.  I had kind of been interested in making bread at home  and more and more interested in the nutrition of it.  And I had heard a programme actually on Radio 4  about community bakers in Liverpool that bake with homeless people.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:52):**  And we were looking for a new activity at Big Thursday.  So we started to make bread.  And we noticed that it brought in people who maybe were too shy  to take part in another activity.  It also included people who couldn't speak any English  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:06):**  because everybody knows about bread.  It might be in jeera or chapati or white slice,  but everybody knows about bread.  So we started making it every week.  And then when we were having a rethink about our work  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:17):**  and realising that there were people right at the margins of the community  that maybe we weren't in contact with,  we thought, well, why don't we take the bread baking out into the community  as a standalone activity?  And then we thought, well, what are we going to do with all the bread  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:31):**  that we make?  Well, why don't we sell it to people?  And that's really how High Rise bakers started.  So that was April 2015.  We started baking, but we spent six months  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:45):**  just kind of baking with the doors closed  and getting our recipes right  and, you know, bringing ourselves up to a consistent standard.  And I also went for some training and community baking.  And then the October of 2015,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:00):**  that was when we started opening regularly for people to come across the door.  And this is our home.  Ah, I bet that light was streaming.  My name is Marie McCormack,  and I work for Bridging the Gap.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:40):**  So I'm a community worker, but I'm the High Rise baker's side.  So it's making bread and other things,  but most of all, probably just, it's probably just the people for me.  There's so small things that you do, but it seems big to them.  And it probably will be big for them  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:58):**  because maybe it's been a benefit issue or something,  and you've phoned it up and maybe sorted it out,  and that's big for them.  So I know I'm making great bread to do that,  and I came in a bit deprived trying to put that good bread back in.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:16):**  But for me, most of all, it's just the people.  That's where I see so much growth.  Because there's loads of things in there with bread, you know.  You can, it's a bit like table tennis.  You can just put a bat on somebody's hand and that's integrated.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:31):**  So it's the same with bread.  Everybody eats bread.  In most countries, they make bread as well.  So maybe because we're working with people that are from different countries,  like from maybe Sudan or Afghanistan or Pakistan,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:45):**  so they all make bread from scratch.  Just people working side by side is a great,  and generally for people to integrate,  break down barriers and build in relationships and things like that.  You're teaching each other, and we've got people that,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:59):**  when we were taught how to make bread from a guy in Edinburgh,  now we've got people that are teaching the new ones that are coming in.  It's great because, you know, you just step back and you've got somebody saying,  oh, this is how you do it and look out for this and look out for that.  I just think that's fantastic.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:17):**  So I think that togetherness, working alongside people,  it's just, that's, I think, is, yeah,  is the way it should anyway is for making bread.  The twice-weekly baking sessions are social events.  There's lots of chat, lots of joking around,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:45):**  and lots of sweet, spicy chai.  It's about building community, resilience and self-esteem.  But it's also very much about producing high-quality, nutritious food  in an area where that can be hard to come by.  People kind of learning to enjoy the kind of bread we make,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:04):**  there's probably always going to be a long game.  People are on very limited income,  so it's quite a big risk to buy something different  if you're not sure if your family are going to eat it.  So early on, we did lots of tastings,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:20):**  and we've cooked for community events,  so people, you get to try the bread for free.  And we've also done, in fact, regularly we do baking workshops,  so people get to make the kind of bread that we make for sale anyway.  And I think that begins to help people think differently  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:37):**  about what we make.  And for me, I think it's really important  that the bread is able to be enjoyed by people locally,  because I think it's not a criticism of other community bakers,  but I think there are a lot of community bakers  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:50):**  where maybe it's people at the Margins Who Bake,  but it's people in middle-class communities who eat the bread.  And I think with the health statistics,  particularly in this part of  where we are, which is some of the worst statistics  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:04):**  in terms of health and crime and things,  I just think, why shouldn't people around here  get to eat really good bread?  Why shouldn't they have access?  The bread all goes out at a cost price.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:15):**  We make something on the sweet goods that we sell,  and the prices are decided by the bakers.  They're local, they know what people are willing to afford.  It's not about making money,  it's primarily a social inclusion project,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:31):**  but I think there's always a tricky balance to walk  between having something that's affordable for people,  or they perceive as affordable,  but having something that's priced that values what you make  and also values the work that the bakers put in,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:47):**  because they're very skilled at what they do,  and I think that's really important that that's acknowledged,  particularly for a group of people who maybe aren't used  to being recognised or valued in other ways.  Can we just start actually...  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:04):**  We should get it up low, eh?  Do it.  I need the walk on.  That's good.  Just so I can get the volume right,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:11):**  can you just start the question?  Talking.  Just start talking.  Yeah, basically.  Maybe I had a little one.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:19):**  Yeah, and then what happens?  A fleece was white as snow.  Yeah.  So I know.  I heard that too.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:26):**  Who am I?  My name's John.  I've been staying in Glasgow for the last 30 years.  So I've been staying up at the flats  and they're renovating the flats.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:38):**  So we can come into the community centre for a cup of tea  while still working in their house.  That's when I got to know Katrina and Marie  and they're teaching me how to make bread.  I was just standing out the window  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:56):**  and Katrina was in the kitchen  and she asked me if I wanted to make a loaf.  I said aye.  And we made the whole meal, the multi-grain bread.  And I just volunteer once a week.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:12):**  That's what I can do.  What John hasn't mentioned there  is that he and the other bakers  are making award-winning bread.  We are mentored by an organisation called Scotland,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:22):**  The Bread, and they set up Scottish Bread Championships.  This is the third year the competition's run.  So we entered it the first year  and were absolutely blown away.  We weren't even sure if we should enter.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:36):**  I got in touch with them and said,  is this for the likes of us?  I said, oh yeah, yeah, we want you to enter.  We won a bronze for our multi-grain loaf,  which we were astounded by.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:46):**  So we tried again this year and we put the multi-grain.  In fact, we put all our bread and we put our garbous loaf  and we put the multi-grain and we put the rolls in.  So John made the rolls.  He's quite a new baker really.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:58):**  He took a lot of care of them.  And I have to say, when they were going off  to the competition, I thought,  they're like the best rolls we've ever made.  We must surely be in with a shout.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:07):**  So I couldn't believe it when we won  and then a silver for our rolls.  I think the category was traditional Scottish recipe.  And then we won a bronze again for our multi-grain  for a loaf of exceptional nutritional quality.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:21):**  So yeah, because I know we were up against  some really fancy bakers, some really experienced bakers.  And again, I think it's about people knowing  that they're as good as anybody else.  We maybe don't charge a fiver of a loaf,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:36):**  but it doesn't mean that our bread's not any good.  It is good and it's able to hold its own  amongst other bakers as well.  What do you think?  I'm going to go to lunch.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:50):**  Maybe a palette knife.  I'm going to have a wee palette knife.  I'll do the answer there.  I'm going to do a fiver of a scallop.  Hi, I'm going to get something else.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:59):**  Oh, this is finished.  Finished.  When High Rise Bakers was starting,  I was interested in getting Scottish flour  because I knew that to get it locally,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:10):**  it was going to be fresh and all that.  And I approached Mungo's Wells,  who at that time were only selling in the Edinburgh area.  So we started off buying from Green City,  the local wholesalers.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:23):**  So we were buying British organic flour,  but not Scottish organic flour.  And then when Mungo's Wells started to expand  into the west of Scotland,  they approached us and said,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:34):**  would you be interested in buying our flour?  And they've been such a fantastic support to us.  The amount of flour that we use in comparison  to other bakers is tiny,  but they're willing to deliver it to the door.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:48):**  You know, and they offer it just as if  we were a big baker.  The thing that I learned when I started using  Mungo's Wells flour is that flour has a smell.  And I hadn't realised that, you know,  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:58):**  that because it's so fresh,  sometimes Alison will phone up and say,  I'm milling today, do you want any plain?  We're coming through tomorrow.  You know, so it's literally a day old flour.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:07):**  So you know, it's going to have the maximum nutrition in it.  But when you open up a sack of their flour,  to me, it smells of the farm in a good way.  And I hadn't realised that fresh flour  could smell it, it smells so good.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:20):**  To hear more about Mungo's Wells,  a farm and mill in East Lothian,  check out episode four of Cereal.  For Katrina, it's important that the bakers know  they're part of a wider food system.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:36):**  And that means understanding what the raw ingredients are,  where they come from, and who produced them.  With a day trip earlier this year,  where we went to visit Mungo's Wells.  So the baker saw, you know,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:50):**  the mill that's made out of the van from the Swiss army  and saw the whole process.  And that was a really lovely thing to do.  And also for, you know, for them to put faces on us  and for us to meet them properly.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:02):**  So, yeah, we have literally seen the process  from beginning to end.  So why do those relationships matter?  Probably not this particular group of people,  but I think the vast majority of people  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:14):**  probably never give a moment's thought  to what has gone into their food  before it reaches the supermarket shelves.  And I think somebody said to me,  and it's probably a no-brainer to lots of people,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:25):**  that we should stop talking about farming  and start talking about food production  and bring that link together again.  Because I think probably a lot of us think,  oh, farmers, those are cheap country people  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:37):**  that hired a few cows and don't really think,  well, why are they doing that?  Well, they're doing that to put food on our tables.  And that's the beginning of the link.  And I think that's really important.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:47):**  When we first started the nursery across the road,  and kept hens, and they didn't know what to do with their eggs.  And they came in and asked us  if we would be interested in their eggs.  And so for several, two years maybe,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:01):**  we made all their snacks,  and we bartered them for eggs.  And I think for the children as well,  they would come and bring the eggs over to us.  The bakers could go and visit the hens  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:12):**  where the eggs came from.  And the kids got to see, you know,  where their snacks,  that's when they got to smell the flour.  Sometimes we'd be baking and they came in.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:21):**  Sometimes we've gone over and made bread with them.  And I think that's really important for valuing food.  Cheers!  I think it's still early days,  even though it's four years.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:01):**  And the rolls sell really well.  There are people that come in and get the rolls regularly.  The bread, there's one or two people that are local  that buy it, but some people buy it,  but they're taking it into work for their colleagues.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:16):**  Other people are people who work locally,  but live somewhere else.  So I don't think that's a failure.  I just think it's a very slow, slow process.  Like the bread, it's a slow process,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:29):**  but hopefully if you are able to give it the time,  then attitudes will shift and people will feel the benefit.  And, you know, I'm a sort of middle-class person  that works in Goerbels.  You're certainly not going to preach about it, you know.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:44):**  And I think it's hard for me to be passionate about it  and not sound prescient just because of who I am.  What you need is people like John,  who's now baking his bread at home  and mugging up my sourdough in his spare time.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:00):**  It's people like him that are going to create  the change in Goerbels when they start talking to their friends.  Or people like Betty, who comes to all our baking workshops.  And the first time she came, she said,  oh, I'm never buying bread again.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:12):**  This is so good.  But, you know, you've also got to work  with the realities of people's lives  and what they can practically...  Which is why they could come and buy it from us  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:21):**  if they wanted to.  But, yeah, I just think it's a very long game  and we have to go at the pace of the people that we're with.  Two of our three main recipes have a heritage in the Goerbels  and I think that's also something...  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:37):**  It's nice to have a story to tell people,  but it also reminds people that Goerbels has got a proud heritage  of doing good things in its community  and, you know, we're just a tiny wee part of trying to help that legacy  live on and give local people access to stuff that's nutritious  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:58):**  as well as tasty and made locally for them as well.

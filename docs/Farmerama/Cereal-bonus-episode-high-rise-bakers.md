**[0:00:00-0:00:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:00):**  So there are two different kind of breads, multi-grain breads.  
**[0:00:02-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:02):**  We've made multi-grain breads, we've made just wholemeal bread.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:07):**  Hello, hello, hello. Testing, testing. One, two, three.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:10):**  Can I get you to start that again?  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:12):**  Hello, hello, hello.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:13):**  Yeah, yeah, no, sorry. That's what you were made.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:16):**  Today we've made multi-grain and wholemeal bread.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:20):**  Shortbread, cinnamon buns, rolls, muffins, tea.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:28):**  That's about it now, yeah? Have we made anything else?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:30):**  I'm a wee near shortcake. All during the afternoon.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:35):**  We've got quite a few regulars that just buy religiously  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:40):**  every Wednesday or every Friday.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:42):**  So yeah, they've been faithful since we've started.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:47):**  I started the High Rise Bakers.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:54):**  Welcome to cereal from Farmerama.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:00:57):**  This is a bonus episode about Glasgow's High Rise Bakers.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:04):**  Can I talk to you a little bit?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:07):**  What are you making?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:08):**  I'm making chai. This is Sudan chai.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:13):**  I'm making this one, cardamom, cinnamon.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:20):**  After bringing ginger one minute, I come and...  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:26):**  Can you make them together?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:28):**  One second.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:29):**  We're in the Gorbils, a neighbourhood just south of the River Clyde in Glasgow.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:34):**  And more specifically, we're in a small community kitchen  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:37):**  on the ground floor of a high-rise block of flats.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:41):**  The kitchen is normally used by a youth club,  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:43):**  but two days a week it becomes a bakery,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:46):**  home to the High Rise Bakers.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:49):**  The bakery was set up by Bridging the Gap,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:52):**  a local charity that supports the community of the Gorbils  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:55):**  in a range of different ways.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:57):**  I'm Katrina Milligan.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:01:59):**  I'm a project worker at Bridging the Gap,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:01):**  and part of my job is the privilege of running High Rise Bakers.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:06):**  So High Rise Bakers is a group of local people.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:10):**  About half of the bakers are from a refugee background.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:13):**  Some people are local and a refugee background.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:15):**  And we come together twice a week  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:18):**  to bake really delicious, nutritious bread for our neighbours.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:21):**  We sell it in the community and other baked goods as well.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:26):**  So it was started as a way of bringing people in who live at the margins  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:29):**  and who maybe couldn't take part in some of our events,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:33):**  which have much larger numbers of people.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:36):**  So it's something that builds community and builds relationships,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:40):**  but it's also something that's purposeful to do.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:43):**  So for quite a lot of the people who come,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:45):**  they're not able to hold down paid employment,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:48):**  maybe because of health reasons  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:49):**  or because of home office regulations.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:52):**  So it gives something meaningful to do that serves their community  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:02:57):**  and enhances life around here.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:01):**  Early on, one of the things that one of our customers said is that  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:05):**  the foyer of the High Rise used to smell of piss  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:08):**  and now it smells of freshly baked bread,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:10):**  which I thought was a massive compliment.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:25):**  One of Bridging the Gap's initiatives is called Big Thursdays.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:29):**  These are drop-in events with discussions and family activities,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:33):**  as well as a shared meal.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:35):**  And it was at Big Thursdays that the idea for High Rise bakers  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:39):**  began to take shape.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:41):**  I had kind of been interested in making bread at home  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:44):**  and more and more interested in the nutrition of it.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:46):**  And I had heard a programme actually on Radio 4  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:48):**  about community bakers in Liverpool that bake with homeless people.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:52):**  And we were looking for a new activity at Big Thursday.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:54):**  So we started to make bread.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:03:57):**  And we noticed that it brought in people who maybe were too shy  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:01):**  to take part in another activity.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:03):**  It also included people who couldn't speak any English  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:06):**  because everybody knows about bread.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:07):**  It might be in jeera or chapati or white slice,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:10):**  but everybody knows about bread.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:13):**  So we started making it every week.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:14):**  And then when we were having a rethink about our work  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:17):**  and realising that there were people right at the margins of the community  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:20):**  that maybe we weren't in contact with,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:23):**  we thought, well, why don't we take the bread baking out into the community  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:26):**  as a standalone activity?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:28):**  And then we thought, well, what are we going to do with all the bread  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:31):**  that we make?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:32):**  Well, why don't we sell it to people?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:33):**  And that's really how High Rise bakers started.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:37):**  So that was April 2015.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:41):**  We started baking, but we spent six months  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:45):**  just kind of baking with the doors closed  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:48):**  and getting our recipes right  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:50):**  and, you know, bringing ourselves up to a consistent standard.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:54):**  And I also went for some training and community baking.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:04:58):**  And then the October of 2015,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:00):**  that was when we started opening regularly for people to come across the door.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:30):**  And this is our home.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:32):**  Ah, I bet that light was streaming.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:36):**  My name is Marie McCormack,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:38):**  and I work for Bridging the Gap.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:40):**  So I'm a community worker, but I'm the High Rise baker's side.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:44):**  So it's making bread and other things,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:47):**  but most of all, probably just, it's probably just the people for me.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:52):**  There's so small things that you do, but it seems big to them.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:57):**  And it probably will be big for them  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:05:58):**  because maybe it's been a benefit issue or something,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:03):**  and you've phoned it up and maybe sorted it out,  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:06):**  and that's big for them.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:08):**  So I know I'm making great bread to do that,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:11):**  and I came in a bit deprived trying to put that good bread back in.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:16):**  But for me, most of all, it's just the people.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:19):**  That's where I see so much growth.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:23):**  Because there's loads of things in there with bread, you know.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:25):**  You can, it's a bit like table tennis.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:28):**  You can just put a bat on somebody's hand and that's integrated.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:31):**  So it's the same with bread.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:32):**  Everybody eats bread.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:34):**  In most countries, they make bread as well.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:38):**  So maybe because we're working with people that are from different countries,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:42):**  like from maybe Sudan or Afghanistan or Pakistan,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:45):**  so they all make bread from scratch.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:48):**  Just people working side by side is a great,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:51):**  and generally for people to integrate,  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:53):**  break down barriers and build in relationships and things like that.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:56):**  You're teaching each other, and we've got people that,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:06:59):**  when we were taught how to make bread from a guy in Edinburgh,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:03):**  now we've got people that are teaching the new ones that are coming in.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:07):**  It's great because, you know, you just step back and you've got somebody saying,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:11):**  oh, this is how you do it and look out for this and look out for that.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:15):**  I just think that's fantastic.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:17):**  So I think that togetherness, working alongside people,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:20):**  it's just, that's, I think, is, yeah,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:24):**  is the way it should anyway is for making bread.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:39):**  The twice-weekly baking sessions are social events.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:42):**  There's lots of chat, lots of joking around,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:45):**  and lots of sweet, spicy chai.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:48):**  It's about building community, resilience and self-esteem.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:53):**  But it's also very much about producing high-quality, nutritious food  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:07:57):**  in an area where that can be hard to come by.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:00):**  People kind of learning to enjoy the kind of bread we make,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:04):**  there's probably always going to be a long game.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:08):**  People are on very limited income,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:11):**  so it's quite a big risk to buy something different  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:14):**  if you're not sure if your family are going to eat it.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:17):**  So early on, we did lots of tastings,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:20):**  and we've cooked for community events,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:22):**  so people, you get to try the bread for free.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:24):**  And we've also done, in fact, regularly we do baking workshops,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:29):**  so people get to make the kind of bread that we make for sale anyway.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:32):**  And I think that begins to help people think differently  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:37):**  about what we make.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:39):**  And for me, I think it's really important  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:42):**  that the bread is able to be enjoyed by people locally,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:46):**  because I think it's not a criticism of other community bakers,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:49):**  but I think there are a lot of community bakers  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:50):**  where maybe it's people at the Margins Who Bake,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:53):**  but it's people in middle-class communities who eat the bread.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:58):**  And I think with the health statistics,  
**[0:08:59-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:08:59):**  particularly in this part of  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:00):**  where we are, which is some of the worst statistics  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:04):**  in terms of health and crime and things,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:05):**  I just think, why shouldn't people around here  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:08):**  get to eat really good bread?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:10):**  Why shouldn't they have access?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:12):**  The bread all goes out at a cost price.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:15):**  We make something on the sweet goods that we sell,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:19):**  and the prices are decided by the bakers.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:23):**  They're local, they know what people are willing to afford.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:26):**  It's not about making money,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:28):**  it's primarily a social inclusion project,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:31):**  but I think there's always a tricky balance to walk  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:35):**  between having something that's affordable for people,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:39):**  or they perceive as affordable,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:41):**  but having something that's priced that values what you make  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:45):**  and also values the work that the bakers put in,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:47):**  because they're very skilled at what they do,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:52):**  and I think that's really important that that's acknowledged,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:54):**  particularly for a group of people who maybe aren't used  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:09:58):**  to being recognised or valued in other ways.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:02):**  Can we just start actually...  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:04):**  We should get it up low, eh?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:05):**  Do it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:08):**  I need the walk on.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:08):**  That's good.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:10):**  Just so I can get the volume right,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:11):**  can you just start the question?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:14):**  Talking.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:15):**  Just start talking.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:16):**  Yeah, basically.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:17):**  Maybe I had a little one.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:19):**  Yeah, and then what happens?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:20):**  A fleece was white as snow.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:23):**  So I know.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:24):**  I heard that too.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:26):**  Who am I?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:28):**  My name's John.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:30):**  I've been staying in Glasgow for the last 30 years.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:34):**  So I've been staying up at the flats  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:36):**  and they're renovating the flats.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:38):**  So we can come into the community centre for a cup of tea  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:42):**  while still working in their house.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:44):**  That's when I got to know Katrina and Marie  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:48):**  and they're teaching me how to make bread.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:54):**  I was just standing out the window  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:56):**  and Katrina was in the kitchen  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:10:58):**  and she asked me if I wanted to make a loaf.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:01):**  I said aye.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:03):**  And we made the whole meal, the multi-grain bread.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:10):**  And I just volunteer once a week.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:12):**  That's what I can do.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:13):**  What John hasn't mentioned there  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:15):**  is that he and the other bakers  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:17):**  are making award-winning bread.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:19):**  We are mentored by an organisation called Scotland,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:22):**  The Bread, and they set up Scottish Bread Championships.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:26):**  This is the third year the competition's run.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:30):**  So we entered it the first year  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:32):**  and were absolutely blown away.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:34):**  We weren't even sure if we should enter.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:36):**  I got in touch with them and said,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:38):**  is this for the likes of us?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:39):**  I said, oh yeah, yeah, we want you to enter.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:41):**  We won a bronze for our multi-grain loaf,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:43):**  which we were astounded by.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:46):**  So we tried again this year and we put the multi-grain.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:48):**  In fact, we put all our bread and we put our garbous loaf  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:51):**  and we put the multi-grain and we put the rolls in.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:53):**  So John made the rolls.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:56):**  He's quite a new baker really.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:11:58):**  He took a lot of care of them.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:00):**  And I have to say, when they were going off  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:02):**  to the competition, I thought,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:03):**  they're like the best rolls we've ever made.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:06):**  We must surely be in with a shout.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:07):**  So I couldn't believe it when we won  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:10):**  and then a silver for our rolls.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:12):**  I think the category was traditional Scottish recipe.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:15):**  And then we won a bronze again for our multi-grain  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:18):**  for a loaf of exceptional nutritional quality.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:21):**  So yeah, because I know we were up against  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:24):**  some really fancy bakers, some really experienced bakers.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:27):**  And again, I think it's about people knowing  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:31):**  that they're as good as anybody else.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:34):**  We maybe don't charge a fiver of a loaf,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:36):**  but it doesn't mean that our bread's not any good.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:39):**  It is good and it's able to hold its own  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:41):**  amongst other bakers as well.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:45):**  What do you think?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:48):**  I'm going to go to lunch.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:50):**  Maybe a palette knife.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:51):**  I'm going to have a wee palette knife.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:52):**  I'll do the answer there.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:54):**  I'm going to do a fiver of a scallop.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:56):**  Hi, I'm going to get something else.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:12:59):**  Oh, this is finished.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:00):**  Finished.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:02):**  When High Rise Bakers was starting,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:05):**  I was interested in getting Scottish flour  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:08):**  because I knew that to get it locally,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:10):**  it was going to be fresh and all that.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:13):**  And I approached Mungo's Wells,  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:15):**  who at that time were only selling in the Edinburgh area.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:18):**  So we started off buying from Green City,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:20):**  the local wholesalers.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:23):**  So we were buying British organic flour,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:26):**  but not Scottish organic flour.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:27):**  And then when Mungo's Wells started to expand  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:30):**  into the west of Scotland,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:33):**  they approached us and said,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:34):**  would you be interested in buying our flour?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:37):**  And they've been such a fantastic support to us.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:40):**  The amount of flour that we use in comparison  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:42):**  to other bakers is tiny,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:44):**  but they're willing to deliver it to the door.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:48):**  You know, and they offer it just as if  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:49):**  we were a big baker.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:51):**  The thing that I learned when I started using  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:53):**  Mungo's Wells flour is that flour has a smell.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:56):**  And I hadn't realised that, you know,  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:58):**  that because it's so fresh,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:13:59):**  sometimes Alison will phone up and say,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:01):**  I'm milling today, do you want any plain?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:03):**  We're coming through tomorrow.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:04):**  You know, so it's literally a day old flour.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:07):**  So you know, it's going to have the maximum nutrition in it.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:09):**  But when you open up a sack of their flour,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:12):**  to me, it smells of the farm in a good way.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:14):**  And I hadn't realised that fresh flour  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:18):**  could smell it, it smells so good.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:20):**  To hear more about Mungo's Wells,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:22):**  a farm and mill in East Lothian,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:24):**  check out episode four of Cereal.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:31):**  For Katrina, it's important that the bakers know  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:33):**  they're part of a wider food system.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:36):**  And that means understanding what the raw ingredients are,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:39):**  where they come from, and who produced them.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:43):**  With a day trip earlier this year,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:45):**  where we went to visit Mungo's Wells.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:48):**  So the baker saw, you know,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:50):**  the mill that's made out of the van from the Swiss army  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:53):**  and saw the whole process.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:55):**  And that was a really lovely thing to do.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:14:56):**  And also for, you know, for them to put faces on us  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:00):**  and for us to meet them properly.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:02):**  So, yeah, we have literally seen the process  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:05):**  from beginning to end.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:07):**  So why do those relationships matter?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:09):**  Probably not this particular group of people,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:12):**  but I think the vast majority of people  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:14):**  probably never give a moment's thought  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:17):**  to what has gone into their food  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:19):**  before it reaches the supermarket shelves.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:21):**  And I think somebody said to me,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:23):**  and it's probably a no-brainer to lots of people,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:25):**  that we should stop talking about farming  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:28):**  and start talking about food production  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:30):**  and bring that link together again.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:32):**  Because I think probably a lot of us think,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:35):**  oh, farmers, those are cheap country people  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:37):**  that hired a few cows and don't really think,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:39):**  well, why are they doing that?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:40):**  Well, they're doing that to put food on our tables.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:43):**  And that's the beginning of the link.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:45):**  And I think that's really important.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:47):**  When we first started the nursery across the road,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:50):**  and kept hens, and they didn't know what to do with their eggs.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:54):**  And they came in and asked us  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:56):**  if we would be interested in their eggs.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:15:58):**  And so for several, two years maybe,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:01):**  we made all their snacks,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:04):**  and we bartered them for eggs.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:07):**  And I think for the children as well,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:08):**  they would come and bring the eggs over to us.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:10):**  The bakers could go and visit the hens  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:12):**  where the eggs came from.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:13):**  And the kids got to see, you know,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:16):**  where their snacks,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:17):**  that's when they got to smell the flour.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:19):**  Sometimes we'd be baking and they came in.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:21):**  Sometimes we've gone over and made bread with them.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:24):**  And I think that's really important for valuing food.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:54):**  Cheers!  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:57):**  I think it's still early days,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:16:59):**  even though it's four years.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:01):**  And the rolls sell really well.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:03):**  There are people that come in and get the rolls regularly.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:06):**  The bread, there's one or two people that are local  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:10):**  that buy it, but some people buy it,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:13):**  but they're taking it into work for their colleagues.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:16):**  Other people are people who work locally,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:17):**  but live somewhere else.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:20):**  So I don't think that's a failure.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:22):**  I just think it's a very slow, slow process.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:28):**  Like the bread, it's a slow process,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:29):**  but hopefully if you are able to give it the time,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:34):**  then attitudes will shift and people will feel the benefit.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:38):**  And, you know, I'm a sort of middle-class person  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:41):**  that works in Goerbels.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:42):**  You're certainly not going to preach about it, you know.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:44):**  And I think it's hard for me to be passionate about it  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:50):**  and not sound prescient just because of who I am.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:53):**  What you need is people like John,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:55):**  who's now baking his bread at home  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:17:57):**  and mugging up my sourdough in his spare time.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:00):**  It's people like him that are going to create  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:02):**  the change in Goerbels when they start talking to their friends.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:06):**  Or people like Betty, who comes to all our baking workshops.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:09):**  And the first time she came, she said,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:11):**  oh, I'm never buying bread again.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:12):**  This is so good.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:14):**  But, you know, you've also got to work  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:16):**  with the realities of people's lives  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:18):**  and what they can practically...  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:19):**  Which is why they could come and buy it from us  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:21):**  if they wanted to.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:22):**  But, yeah, I just think it's a very long game  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:26):**  and we have to go at the pace of the people that we're with.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:31):**  Two of our three main recipes have a heritage in the Goerbels  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:35):**  and I think that's also something...  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:37):**  It's nice to have a story to tell people,  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:39):**  but it also reminds people that Goerbels has got a proud heritage  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:44):**  of doing good things in its community  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:48):**  and, you know, we're just a tiny wee part of trying to help that legacy  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:53):**  live on and give local people access to stuff that's nutritious  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-high-rise-bakers#t=0:18:58):**  as well as tasty and made locally for them as well.

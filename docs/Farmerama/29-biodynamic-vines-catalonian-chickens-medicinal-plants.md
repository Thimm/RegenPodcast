### Farmerama  (2017-12-31)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:00):**  Hello everybody, and welcome once again to Farmerama.  We have some slightly longer stories for you this month from three young farmers scattered  across the globe.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:19):**  We visit one of the lesser known wine-making regions, Wales, to get one perspective on  biodynamic farming.  Then we're off to the hills of Catalonia to hear from a small-scale chicken farmer.  
**[0:00:31-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:00:31):**  And finally we take a dose of medicine just outside Seattle in the form of herbs, human  connections and the land itself.  First up is young Welsh biodynamic farmer, Dave Morris.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:01):**  He grows and makes natural wine at Anchor Hill Estates in Monmouthshire, Wales.  Biodynamic farming is often seen as pretty esoteric, but Dave makes it all seem fairly  straightforward and sensible.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:18):**  Here he tells us why he converted to biodynamics from conventional farming, explains some of  the philosophy and describes how he prepares his special biodynamic brews.  So I'm Dave Morris, I'm the winemaker and vineyard manager at Anchor Hill Estates, which  
**[0:01:37-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:37):**  is a biodynamically certified vineyard and winery in Monmouth, which is like southeast  Wales.  So I was managing a lot of land, nearly 45 hectares of vines that was all quite young,  
**[0:01:50-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:01:50):**  that had been planted on sort of very intensively farmed arable land that hadn't really had  a rest and the amount of sort of chemicals and stuff that was being used on the grapes  just to sort of get them productive and keep them productive seemed to be increasing every  
**[0:02:08-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:08):**  year and like the actual sort of quality of the soil was noticeably deteriorating.  So all the things sort of combined, I kind of didn't make any logical sense.  There didn't seem any sort of sustainability to carrying on that way.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:25):**  So that's when I started reading about specially biodynamic production.  You know, there was one particular farmer, a producer called Gerard Goby whose methods  were very, seemed really practical and logical and really down to earth.  
**[0:02:41-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:02:41):**  He was just a good farmer and that really sort of struck a chord with me and I sort  of kind of maybe against sort of advice at the time, chucked in my quite good job and  comfortable life and moved to France and worked for somebody who was affiliated with him and  
**[0:03:03-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:03):**  also worked for a similar sort of ideologically minded producer in Champagne and Burgundy  and everything I learnt then sort of brought back here.  So it's very similar lines to sort of soil association or organic accreditation.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:19):**  In fact, we actually do achieve a organic certification as well.  But then to get the Demeter certification, you have to be using the biodynamic preps.  So preparation 500, which is horn manure and preparation 501, which is horn silica have  
**[0:03:38-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:38):**  to be used at least once a year.  And the idea of those two is one is working on the soil, the 500, and one is working on  light really on the atmosphere and that's 501.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:03:55):**  And so the two kind of used in conjunction to balance each other.  The two preps, the reason I prefer it to sort of organics is that biodynamics seems a lot  more like proactive in that you're trying to affect those two forces.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:17):**  It's not just about what you don't use.  And from a logical point of view, 500 to me is like such an intense population of active  bacteria and fungi that you're kind of like if you're making bread or beer or something,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:32):**  you're creating the conditions in the soil rather than like the dough.  And then you're adding loads of bacteria and fungi to that to proliferate.  It's like seeding the ground.  
**[0:04:47-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:04:47):**  With the 501, it's more a case of you're basically spraying a very, very dilute set of crystals  all over the vineyard.  I'll start stirring for 501 at like half past four in the morning.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:02):**  I'll have it sprayed on the whole vineyard by eight o'clock in the morning.  And then you have like, if it's a beautiful sunny day, you've basically kind of almost  sprayed like hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors all over your canopy.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:13):**  And the sunlight is reflecting all of those.  You're maximizing your sunlight.  I like the philosophical aspect of biodynamics, but there's a kind of a practical rationale  
**[0:05:23-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:23):**  as well that I find really interesting.  Again, under organic and biodynamic certification, you're allowed to use sulfur and copper.  The two, as most people know.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:38):**  Sulfur is really readily just evaporating and used up in the environment.  So I wouldn't say it's not harmful, but there's more of a buffer.  There's more sort of capacity for the environment to use it.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:05:54):**  Copper's much more kind of, it hangs around in the soil for a long, long time and can  cause quite a few problems.  And if it's used in the right, you know, small amounts and stuff, it can be necessary.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:07):**  I understand that.  I'd rather not use it if I could.  And so we started looking at alternatives and then again, from reading mainly, started  
**[0:06:16-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:16):**  discovering that willow and other Osia trees are very high in salicylic acid.  It's actually very easy to extract salicylic acid and it could be used instead of copper.  So initially we started using it in conjunction with a copper spray.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:35):**  And as the vines have become sort of healthier and more robust as they've got used to biodynamics  and some, you know, like ground cover competition, all that sort of stuff, we've eased off and  we've not had to use copper now for, this is the fifth year.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:06:50):**  Because of where we live and where we're growing as well, there's a huge number of other plants  that are really high in salicylic acid.  So we use something called Clivers as well, which is goose grass that, you know, like  
**[0:07:00-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:00):**  as a kid you can get stick to people's clothes.  And it's really, again, again, it's really kind of logical and obvious.  Like these plants can grow in humid, damp conditions where nothing else can because  
**[0:07:14-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:14):**  they'll suffer from disease.  And there's a reason that these plants don't.  And so they're kind of, you know, they're telling you, they've got their hands up really  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:22):**  asking to be used.  And luckily Wales is quite wet lots of the time.  So there's lots of those plants.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:29):**  So they're all readily available.  They're all picked really easily, really quickly from around the vineyard and on the fringes  of the vineyard and usable.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:38):**  So the spraying is quite a lot of preparation because some of the sprays don't, they won't  last very long.  You've got to use them within sort of 24 hours.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah, when the conditions look right, you've got to sort of make a decision and go and  then, yeah, cross your fingers.  Yeah, my kid, I've got two young kids and they like, since Harry Potter, they've just  
**[0:07:58-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:07:58):**  been like, oh, daddy does that.  It's the same as kind of any philosophy or, you know, there's a like a spiritual element  to it that sometimes certain people can become very dogmatic about how something's done.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:19):**  For me, when I read like the agriculture course by Steiner, it's just full of ideas.  And you know, he was a philosopher.  He wasn't a farmer.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:27):**  He's just trying to sort of help and open people's minds.  And so for me, it's just a mine of ideas and they were just that.  And you can start then and explore them yourself.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:39):**  And that's, for me, that's what biodynamics is about.  It's about trying to be proactive and trying to think on a much greater sort of level and  a wider sort of scope about what you're doing and why you're doing it.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:08:53):**  And it's that sort of kind of that interrogation.  The reason why all of their plants used in biodynamic preparations grow around here is  because they've always been used.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:01):**  And it's kind of almost that knowledge has been lost.  And so it's just his, to me, it's just his kind of reimagining of how and why they should  be used.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:13):**  It's having a kind of a philosophy to adhere to and to work to and having a sort of a greater  purpose to it is kind of, it's really helpful.  You know, we were talking earlier about how hard farming can be sometimes.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:09:26):**  If you've got that kind of center point that like a moral sort of principle and why you're  doing it, it gives you a target and gives you something to be, to go back to.  Dave Morris from Anchor Hill Estates.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:08):**  As we heard in a recent episode, new farmer Joel Rodker is in the process of setting up  a market garden near Peterborough.  We're going to be back with him following his journey early in the new year.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:39):**  Earlier this year, Joel spent time with Jaume Pratel.  Jaume is a chicken farmer who, like Joel, is moving towards making a living off the  land.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:10:47):**  Here, he talks to Joel about some of the creative ways he's making the most of a challenging  environment high in the mountains of Catalonia.  We are surrounded by mountains, not very high.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:05):**  We are like 300 meters high from the sea.  Above sea level.  We are surrounded by pine and oak trees, forests.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:18):**  We are like 10 kilometers far from the sea, but since we are surrounded by mountains,  we don't get that much of the influence as other towns around us.  Well I'm Jaume Pratel.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:36):**  I'm 40 years old and I'm doing chicken egg farming in Orius, a little community about  one hour far from Barcelona.  Life goes up and down, so I was working in a, I was a technician in a show company.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:11:58):**  Since I had two sons, my two sons, well I realized I had to change my life.  And one of my dreams was to work the land.  And here in this community in Orius, I found a place to work, find a piece of land, because  
**[0:12:16-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:16):**  it's not easy.  We arrived to Camp Famadas, which is the farm that we live and we work.  And there was another man who was doing vegetables, just starting to, and we thought that doing  
**[0:12:34-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:34):**  eggs could be a good complement for his activity, the one that he was doing.  And well, we started learning about it because we only knew about our experience with three,  four hands, that's it.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:12:51):**  And I was very lucky because my wife is very brave and she was like, yes, let's do it.  That's our dream.  It's now or never.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:04):**  We have, we think it's a small farm.  It's thought to be worked by my wife and myself.  We have 1,200 hens producing organic eggs.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:23):**  We have around 1,000 eggs a day.  The first thing, our main occupation was to produce eggs.  Once that we start producing, then we concern about what to do with manure, as an instance.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:13:48):**  Manure is going back to the land with our neighbor, who works on vegetables.  But also, we are experimenting making worm castings.  So we try to feed worms with our chicken manure.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:13):**  We are producing then worm castings that can be used in the field of our neighbors or other  farmers.  We are still working to improve that.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:27):**  And our main goal could be to feed our chicken part of their meal with those worms that we  are producing.  Let's see.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:41):**  That's very difficult because we need thousands and thousands of worms.  But that could be our main goal in the next years.  We are also working with the old hens.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:14:55):**  Hens that have finished their main productive period, so they get old, they don't produce  a good quality egg because the shell is very thin and they break.  So with the old ones, we are making soup.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:16):**  It's a new product that we are trying.  We mix it with organic vegetables and we make organic soup, which is a new thing in our  market around.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:32):**  We are changing our landscape, our piece of the world that we are running.  And that means that we have to cut some trees to plant other trees.  We are doing a transformation of the space following an idea that we have.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:15:51):**  We need trees because we need the shadow and we need the protection that the tree gives  to the hens.  But if we have an oak or a pine, it gives us the shadow and the protection but not fruit.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:08):**  We thought that if we change it, we also can have fruit for the hens and for us.  And we start having some proofs to see if, because we don't have that much water, so  we try to see how they react.  
**[0:16:28-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:16:28):**  And well, actually we have around 50 fruit trees of all kind of species, all the species  that we are working with a farmer that recuperates these varieties of old fruit trees.  So we have like a garden of different kind of fruit.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:01):**  My life has changed in a better way since I can, if I want, I can have breakfast, lunch  or dinner with my sons and my family.  I work next to my house.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:18):**  I put my timetable.  I choose my customers in some way and I wouldn't change that.  I've never done it before and I like it a lot.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:32):**  I am also more related to land, which is satisfying, and also with my community.  Now I'm not Jaume.  They call me Jaume, the egg producer.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:17:49):**  So we have an identity related to land and I like that too.  People don't do that much, but they like having people around them producing because they  know where products come from.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:08):**  That was Jaume Pertel talking to Joel Rodker for Farmerama.  Ari Delania is the owner operator of community supported Camion Farm near Seattle.  Camion, by the way, is Tagalog for with hands, a reference to the Filipino tradition of eating  
**[0:18:45-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:45):**  with your hands and to the intimate connection between us and our food.  As well as being a farmer, Ari is also an educator with a focus on the land and plants  as medicine.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:18:56):**  She spoke to Abby about both aspects of her work and the ways they inform each other.  I just finished a workshop series around the theme of plant allies.  We were exploring the idea of using plants as sort of a guide into our own personal well-being.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:17):**  The first workshop was on plant meditation and learning how to sit with plants and be  in deeper relationship with them.  A lot of the people who come to my farm live in cities generally.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:30):**  They are around plants all the time but maybe not present enough to see that or to notice  that and so we wanted to give them some tools to be able to feel more resilient and feel  more connected to the place that they're in even if they're living in a city and they're  
**[0:19:45-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:45):**  just walking a few blocks every day to catch the train.  And part of that, I think when you're talking about communicating with plants, this might  sound kind of crazy to people, is like being able to trust your own intuition, right?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:19:57):**  And that like what you hear, what you perceive from plants is actually good and valid information  and I think that's a knowledge set that's been lost over time as we become more industrialized  and there's more focus on like hard science.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:10):**  So I think that it's a type of knowledge that's much older that I'm trying to bring back by  using plants.  I came from a place that was like really lush.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:21):**  There were trees everywhere, there was plant life everywhere and I spent a lot of my childhood  sort of escaping into that and I went to college thinking I would do like environmental law  or something and be kind of an advocate for the environment and then when I started studying  
**[0:20:37-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:37):**  environmental justice, I started thinking more deeply about all the ways that people  and the environment are so interconnected and that you can't actually approach like  advocating for the environment without talking about the people that are reliant upon it.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:20:54):**  And so I just went really deep into food work because everyone has to eat and there are  so many different issues that intersect with food and how we eat.  So you can have conversations about it forever from so many different angles and that ended  
**[0:21:11-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:11):**  me up in the policy world which was great and a really amazing learning experience and  I feel grateful now as a farmer to have that framework to think through when I'm doing  my work and when I'm talking to people.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:24):**  But I had been moving around doing all these different jobs for years and years and years  and I wanted to go home.  I was really tired and my body was really tired and I went back home and I started farming  
**[0:21:36-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:36):**  and I think it's been a really amazing experience to farm and do land work where you grew up  because I know the history of that place and I have a personal history there.  So I think for me personally it's been really healing and that's been part of what I've  
**[0:21:50-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:21:50):**  been trying to share with other people.  In the UK we don't focus so much on our cultural context as much as it is here and especially  like different ethnicity, all that kind of stuff doesn't come up nearly as much.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:02):**  It would be great if you could say like what your cultural context is being here and how  that kind of manifests in the agricultural world.  There's a number of different ways I could describe that but typically what I tell people  
**[0:22:14-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:14):**  is that I mixed white and Filipina and I often say that I'm a bridge builder because I sort  of exist in two different worlds and in some ways sort of this anomaly and so I have a  lot of community that are folks of color and Filipino folks and then I also grew up inside  
**[0:22:32-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:32):**  of a white family and so I kind of exist in a lot of different cultural contexts which  I think is part of why my work feels really relevant to me because I see a lot of people,  especially where I'm farming, there's a lot of Filipino folks who have immigrated or just  
**[0:22:49-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:22:49):**  a lot of immigrants in general who experienced trauma through the act of migration and maybe  it was they chose to move but a lot of times that wasn't the case.  Their families had to leave their countries of origin and so I think that I've been moving  
**[0:23:06-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:06):**  towards sort of catering to them because there's such a longing to have a sense of place and  belonging and to find people who are talking about land in a way that feels relevant to  them and the sort of like movement that they've experienced because I think when you get displaced  
**[0:23:25-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:25):**  from your homeland there is so much loss there and if you don't find ways to sort of fill  that hole it can be deeply traumatic for the rest of your life.  I don't think there's anything that can fix that but I think learning the plants of a  
**[0:23:41-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:41):**  place and the environment and the ecosystems of a place that you're currently living in  can be a way to sort of heal and mend some of that.  I've learned so many things about my body and the way that my body works just by working  
**[0:23:56-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:23:56):**  on the land and one of the other farmers said earlier like I don't want to be the farmer  that at age 60 my body doesn't work anymore because of working this land and I'm constantly  thinking of the lessons that the land is trying to teach me and one of those things is like  
**[0:24:12-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:12):**  the land doesn't overwork you know like the land knows how to work in community and all  the plants know how to work in community with each other so that they're not straining constantly  and one of the things that like teaches me that is sort of the temporality or the impermanence  
**[0:24:29-0:24:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:29):**  of everything and so a lot of days I'll be running around really really busy and part  of my business is to harvest medicinal herbs and a lot of things that are medicinal are  also considered weeds so sometimes there'll be this big flush of weeds that I need to  
**[0:24:43-0:25:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:24:43):**  harvest for my business and I won't notice because I'll just be so busy like running  and running and running and the land is so generous and constantly teaching you how to  be present and how to be in your body and aware enough to to sort of move through those  
**[0:25:01-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:01):**  cycles with it.  I'm constantly grateful that the land is so patient with humans and just is like okay  here's your lesson again here it comes again and you know I feel really lucky when there  
**[0:25:12-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:12):**  are those moments when I actually stop to pay attention.  A lot of people were talking about this idea of like the feminine and nurturing which I  think is really important but I also think that the feminine can also be about like destruction  
**[0:25:25-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:25):**  and renewal and like anger and you know I think that there are all of these incredibly  dynamic ways that women can be and in my farming community there are tons of women who are  all so different and that's part of what makes it a really robust community and so I think  
**[0:25:43-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:25:43):**  it's important to not be reductive or minimize what women can look like in this movement  because we need women that have such different characteristics to do all the different pieces  of it you know there's like restaurant work there are chefs there are farmers there are  
**[0:26:01-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:01):**  herders and pastoralists we need all of those people and anybody any woman could do those  jobs you know so I think it's it's a matter of creating a platform for all of that diversity  to show because then I think more and more people will come to join us.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:20):**  What does that platform look like I guess is the question I mean that's a difficult  question.  I think it depends on the scale that you're talking about but for example in my local  
**[0:26:28-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:28):**  community I see women doing a ton of the work like they're running their own farms and then  they're also doing local policy work and they're also putting on these events they're doing  a ton of labor a lot of women just don't have enough time to also be at the front of a room  
**[0:26:46-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:26:46):**  talking to people at the end of their 16 hour day and what I think is actually really necessary  now is that like men and other people that are sort of peripheral to this farming movement  are stepping up to help support and take on some of that labor so that they can be the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:01):**  voice and they can represent themselves.  The more that we can mirror the diversity of what nature creates the better off we'll  be and the more resilient we'll be and I think there's no one path or one model for how we  
**[0:27:15-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:15):**  can do this and I think the more models that there are the better off we'll be.  Thanks for joining us this month and in fact all this year we've had a brilliant time bringing  you stories from farmers and growers all over the world and we're looking forward to lots  
**[0:27:38-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:38):**  more in the new year.  Personally I'm still grounded quite literally by the reminder in episode 23 that we're all  going to end up as soil and I loved hearing about care farming projects in episode 21.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:27:51):**  Great examples of agriculture producing emotional mental and social yields as well as physical  ones.  I loved hearing from the Welsh sheep farmer Rhys Roberts and Dame Fiona Reynolds in episode  
**[0:28:05-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:05):**  22 with their thoughts on beauty and actually all the people who got in touch after saying  farming is definitely about beauty to them.  Looking forward I'm excited about the ongoing consultation on the Good Food Nation Bill  
**[0:28:25-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:25):**  here in Scotland.  It has the potential to be a pioneering cross-cutting piece of legislation but only if a truly wide  range of voices have the opportunity to contribute.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:36):**  If you're involved at all do get in touch.  For the year ahead I'm excited to hear more stories from the fields.  What's important to you?  
**[0:28:48-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:28:48):**  We make Farmerama to share knowledge amongst the independent farming community so if you've  got another story for us do let us know.  We'd love to help you bring it to air and there are many different ways we can do that.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:01):**  We can support you to record a story yourself and then help with the editing or you might  like to tell us your story over the phone or even invite us down to your farm to visit  you in person.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:11):**  If you've got an idea let's talk and see how it might happen.  Farmerama is produced by me Katie, me Abby and Jo who does a lot of organising and editing  behind the scenes.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:27):**  Thank you Jo.  We'd like to thank everyone we've worked with this year.  The list has grown so long that we can't mention everyone by name but for this episode thank  
**[0:29:38-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:38):**  you to Joel Rodker for bringing us Catalonian chickens and to Annie for her social media  support.  Thank you also to someone who's there in the background every month, Owen who provided  
**[0:29:48-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-29#t=0:29:48):**  our theme music.  We're not bored of it yet but we would love you to make us some more.

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:00:00):**  I guess being outside in nature to me, especially in the last two years, has become a bit of  a necessity, a very, very concrete part of my day-to-day rituals. I now cannot imagine  a day where I don't go outside in some capacity, be that in urban landscapes or rural landscapes.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:00:32):**  It's something that I have found very grounding and very transient to be in, especially during  lockdown and just having the time and space to just go outside and exist in nature.  Cultivating Justice. Cultivating Justice. Cultivating Justice. Cultivating Justice.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:01:04):**  Cultivating Justice, episode two. Growing, watering, cleaning my plants, like  any activity that just allows me to connect with nature and disconnect from the world,  even medicinally, by the so much joy in nature.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:01:43):**  Like maybe on like a bigger scale, I've always been into like hiking and I really like to  climb and I like to swim. I guess being in nature has always been a place where I felt  at ease and excited and have like a lot of joy.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:02:01):**  For a lot of my life, we didn't kind of have a garden, but my aunt did have a garden and  a lot of the time we kind of grew vegetables at hers and we had a kind of small balcony  when I was growing up and it would be covered in plants. So I feel like my parents have  
**[0:02:18-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:02:18):**  always been very enthusiastic about nature, whatever that means. Whether that would just  be going for really nice long walks and just like spending time kind of being still in  the trees or yeah, I've always loved climbing trees as well actually. My parents kind of  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:02:40):**  have a running joke about that, that if I just go missing for a bit, it's probably  because I'm just in a tree somewhere.  Growing up in Sheffield, I didn't really do many outsidey naturey things with my family,  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:02:55):**  but I was super lucky to live next door to the sweetest family who were very kind of  pro nature, radical guys. I love them to bits. They're still there. They still live next  door to my mum and I'm really close to them. They saw something in me, this early interest  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:03:15):**  in the natural world and they took me all over the place to all these nature reserves.  They took me bird watching and really kind of honed my knowledge and opened my eyes to  what was going on beyond suburban Sheffield. I'm forever grateful for that. My early kind  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:03:39):**  of interactions with non-human beings was with birds, bird watching and that gave me  so much joy as a child and it still does today. I can be on my allotment and do literally  nothing for a number of hours except for sitting on my little chair, listening to the birds  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:03:59):**  with a cup of tea and it's the best thing in the world.  I'm Abbey Rose. And I'm Nadia Mehdi. Welcome to Cultivating Justice. Before we start, a  heads up that this episode includes discussion of racism, colonialism and class-based discrimination.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:04:23):**  Please take care as you listen. I'm Nadia Mehdi and I'm the assistant producer on this  podcast. I'm also a keen allotmenter and forager and just general lover of nature. And I'm  Abbey Rose, an executive producer on this series and co-creator of Farmarama, soil advocate  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:04:42):**  and deeply immersed in the agroecological farming world. Cultivating Justice is a collaboration  between Land in Our Names, Out on the Land and Farmarama. We're working together to share  and celebrate the stories of people who are marginalised in mainstream land work. That  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:05:00):**  includes women, people of colour, trans and queer people and neurodivergent people. Cultivating  Justice aims to build lasting joy and justice for these communities as we resist and reimagine  colonial patriarchal and imperialist food and farming systems. In this episode, we'll  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:05:17):**  hear about a series of foraging walks for black people and people of colour. And a conversation  about how urban gardens can be sanctuaries, healing spaces and sites of solidarity. Maimana  Arifin is a London-based community gardener, spoken word poet and artist. But my main  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:05:36):**  kind of interest is in the world of fungi and also in plants. So I do a lot of kind  of herbalism and nature-related activities with people. Maimana has a particular interest  in the connections between fungi, social justice and mutual aid. And they're also a part of  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:05:55):**  Misery Party. Misery Party is a mental health and harm reduction collective. Their activities  focus on healing for queer, trans and non-binary black people and people of colour. It started  off as a sober club night in London. Aisha, who is now also really like lovely and cherished  
**[0:06:13-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:06:13):**  friend of mine as well, set up Misery in, I think 2019, so just before the pandemic.  We wanted to kind of offer a space to people which could still be fun and still be joyful  and loving and all of these things, but also provide people with a space where they could  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:06:32):**  actually like show up for themselves and kind of by showing up for themselves also be able  to show up for their community as well. I really do feel strongly about like having  to focus inwardly and focus on your own mental health before you can offer kind of healing  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:06:49):**  for a community or for other people and extend that outwards. There's obviously so much grief  and hardship and trauma ultimately in this community, but that does not in any way like  take away from their ability to show up for each other and that just feels so, so special  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:07:10):**  and like powerful for me as well. Since 2019, Misery Parties expanded beyond its beginnings  as a sober club night and they're now running other activities too. One of them is a series  of foraging walks for black people and people of colour. The walks go by the name Misery  
**[0:07:28-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:07:28):**  Medicine Plant Magic. They're basically a series of once a month walks specifically  for queer and trans people of colour and black people. Aisha Mirza, who's the founder of  Misery Party, was the person that kind of conjured it up in their mind first of all  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:07:46):**  and then asked me and Rashika Ahmed, who's known as Hedge Herbs on Instagram. And yeah,  we kind of just really wanted it to be a space for people to explore and whatever the kind  of relationship with nature was before that, we were kind of welcoming people who are beginning  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:08:05):**  that journey or people who are much more sort of well acquainted and knowledgeable about  nature already. And we wanted to kind of draw metaphors between what the natural world is  doing at a particular time or particular season and what kind of emotion that evokes in us.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:08:24):**  It's just like naming that so we can all reflect on how we actually do feel in that month.  And it may be sometimes different to the theme, but we kind of want to hold space for that  as well. So the first theme was rise. And that kind of felt really powerful, kind of  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:08:41):**  reminds me of like the Maya Angelou poem, Still I Rise. And so in trees during this  time in kind of early spring, the sap is kind of rising inside of them. I think it was Rashika  that suggested that word and it immediately resonated just because it kind of also speaks  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:08:58):**  to the power of sort of like being able to arise after a lot of grief and a lot of loss,  but also after winter, which is kind of when people feel a little bit more like they need  to hibernate and kind of turn inwards. So rising felt like it was the right way to summarize  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:09:16):**  like people being able to show up and kind of all come together in the way that I feel  really lucky that that actually did happen because it felt quite abstract when we were  planning it. It feels really joyous for me to kind of be seeing all of the new growth  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:09:31):**  and blossoms and kind of colors start to emerge at this time in April and May. Just really  allow people to check in with their bodies and themselves and then relate that to kind  of where we are because each month we're in a different green space in London. So it's  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:09:49):**  kind of like an exploration of ourselves and also a space, a physical space in the world.  The first walk we held in Tower Hamlet Cemetery Park, which I would really, really recommend.  We kind of were just walking around in these carpets of sweet violets and then also lots  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:10:10):**  of wild garlic, which people listening might be familiar with. It's kind of quite thick  blades of grass that smell very strongly. So we foraged a bit of that. It's a foragers  delight just now. Like in the early part of spring, you'll see it in woodland places,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:10:28):**  big carpets, swades and carpets and shady woodlands. And then once you get closer up,  it's like quite a wide blade, so much wider than any other types of grass or anything  else in the environment. And it's quite a flat leaf as well. And it feels quite smooth.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:10:45):**  It's also got like some kind of parallel lines on it and a pointed kind of tip.  What we'll be doing going forward as well is a bit of a kind of group gathering at the  beginning to set some intentions and kind of speak about foraging and foraging respectfully.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:11:01):**  It's really lovely to be able to explore freely, but also how can we do that in a way that's  respectful with the plants in our surroundings and how can we meet them with gratitude and  not take too much and kind of not perpetuate the idea of kind of extracting too much from  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:11:17):**  nature for ourselves. The importance of having kind of plant medicine exchanges is just to  help people to feel that sense of belonging and help people to feel that ownership over  actually what they do know and how they do relate to the world and honouring that and  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:11:37):**  not feeling like actually we have to use the Latin names or kind of like know all of the  different plants around us immediately by those names. I think it's really just being  able to meet plants and kind of recognise them or build relationships with them. It  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:11:54):**  was really nice last time I just kind of asked people to have a look around them and then  people were kind of bringing me different leaves that they'd found and asking if I could  identify them, which was really nice. But I guess the idea is just to allow people to  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:12:06):**  have that free space to kind of be playful and inquisitive and not necessarily like lectured  or taught in any way by me or Rishika. There is so much knowledge within this community  in the file space and it's just about being able to share that amongst each other and  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:12:23):**  whether that's kind of intergenerationally or in terms of people who have more experience  in horticulture, which is quite a difficult industry to get into as a black person or  a person of colour in general. We just wanted to make that space available for those conversations  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:12:40):**  to happen really, to come into a group setting and just learn from each other and be able  to share a lot of the sort of knowledge within our community.  What we always do is I ask everyone to be silent while we taste the tea. And it's really  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:12:57):**  a way of connecting with meeting this plant or plants that are in the tea and also feeling  what the energy of the plant is in your body. So it's something that I studied and that  we've all been doing in our practice with herbal medicine. It's encouraged as a way  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:13:13):**  to meet this plant as another living being so that you meet it almost as if it's a new  person that you're making friends with. But we always go through this process of like  what's the smell? What does the smell feel like? And then what's the taste? And then  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:13:26):**  hold it in your mouth for a little bit and see what that feels like, the texture. And  then once you drink it, where does it go in your body? Do you feel it in any particular  part or does it have an effect, physical effect that you can feel?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:13:39):**  I think even as a relatively privileged brown woman in London, I still feel like it can  be quite difficult to kind of actually find spaces where you feel not only welcome but  also like actually free to explore your interests within gardening and not kind of be pushed  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:13:59):**  into a more mainstream white-centered narrative around what horticulture means or like what  gardening is or what our relationships to land should look like. I do have knowledge  from my sort of Bangladeshi heritage and from my grandparents and my mom and my dad are  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:14:19):**  both really keen growers and they always have been and that's something that's been passed  down to me and I just feel like it's actually quite rare that you are able to share that  knowledge with other people who also come from a history of kind of erasure or kind  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:14:36):**  of like that estrangement that people sometimes have with their own heritage because of colonialism.  It's been a real like amazing process for me as well. I think a lot of people have this  sort of private connection with nature and a lot of knowledge that they don't necessarily  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:14:53):**  get an opportunity to share with others. Throughout the day I just had like some really lovely  interactions with people who were kind of like very early in their journey of meeting  different plants or learning about their properties in herbalism and yeah I just felt really really  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:15:10):**  honored to kind of be part of that process. Even talking about it now I still feel quite  overwhelmed honestly and I think every month I'm just going to be really like emotionally  like overwhelmed by how kind of nice it all feels and how yeah how grateful I am to be  
**[0:15:28-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:15:28):**  part of such a loving community.  What I really get from Maimana's description and the plant magic wax what I really get  is this like unbelievable sense of belonging and connectedness. I really love how they  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:16:27):**  talk about meeting plants and then I also really enjoyed the focus from Maimana on not  having to say the Latin names and you know just really looking inside yourself and seeing  you know what experiential knowledge do you have that you can bring to this plant-based  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:16:45):**  experience essentially or this plant interaction and meeting that's happening that doesn't  have to be contextualized within the kind of constraints of a you know a white colonial  interaction with a plant and how freeing that is and the sense of belonging that they talk  
**[0:17:03-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:17:03):**  about that comes with that that just for me felt so exciting, inspiring and magical like  it really is magic of being able to connect on that level.  It definitely did resonate with me too. I started my foraging journey perhaps four years  
**[0:17:24-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:17:24):**  ago now and it was completely amazing to see everything around me in nature in a completely  different light. There were sort of plants that I'd got to know, plants that I was still  to get to know. They weren't just weeds surrounding me on the pavement or country lanes, they  
**[0:17:46-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:17:46):**  were things that I knew I could use or that could be used by other animals and that were  of benefit to sort of like a diverse biology. Not just me but to everything.  I now get really excited about things like plantain. It's such a common in inverted commas  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:18:15):**  weeds but now it's like my favorite plant because I really love the structure of it  and I know that it has a really deep tap root and it's able to just spurt up anywhere and  then start to like be drought resistant and plants are so magical and meeting them I think  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:18:32):**  like Maima says it so well it is meeting them it just opens up like a whole treasure chest  of experience. I love to introduce people and again that's  the meeting like I introduce like one friend to another I love to introduce them to pineapple  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:18:48):**  weeds out on walks and just see sort of like their minds be blown when they taste this  little yellow ball that tastes so tropical it's like it's got no business being in our  drab country but there it is. Yeah everything's turning up where you don't  
**[0:19:07-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:19:07):**  expect it to and I think that's kind of cool.  Bringing from something dissolving to something transforming together never consenting to  being one thing beginnings and endings go on reversing into, out of, into, out of, inside,  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:20:07):**  outside, inside, outside, outside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside.  outside, inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, inside, inside, outside,  Inside is outside.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:21:20):**  That was a clip from a performance by artist Sin Wai Kin.  It was commissioned by the Queer Ecologies Collective as part of their microbe disco in August 2020.  The piece mixes Sin Wai Kin's original sounds and poetry with music from the Butterfly Lovers violin concerto  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:21:37):**  and recordings from oceans and compost piles.  And what you're hearing right now is a field recording by Amu Gibbo taken by a canal in London.  I feel completely mesmerised by Sin Wai Kin's artwork, recordings, expressions,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:21:57):**  and I really am grateful to Sin Wai Kin for creating that and sharing it.  It's like somehow Sin Wai Kin captures the experience of dissolving a binary gender in the world.  And when I'm immersed in their work, I can experience the world without those boundaries in it.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:22:27):**  I've never had that experience from a piece of audio before.  Next, we're going to hear a conversation about claiming and creating urban gardens,  sanctuaries, healing spaces, and sites of solidarity.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:22:42):**  Sam Siva is a grower, a writer, and an organiser with Land in Our Names, or LION.  They're interested in liberation through healing and building resilient communities  and the ways that access to the land and to nature are key to this.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:22:57):**  Carol Wright is a project manager, community gardener, beekeeper, and proud South Londoner.  Carol grew up in Brixton, but she now lives in Southwark.  She's a passionate and talented gardener.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:23:10):**  At the moment, she manages two community gardens in South London.  Carol also founded the annual Black Outside Festival.  It's a grassroots, intergenerational event that supports working class social housing residents,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:23:24):**  as well as the queer, trans, intersex, black, and people of colour communities.  Sam met Carol at the community garden on Carol's home estate, Peabody Black Forest.  The two of them chatted about the links between growing in the city, community organising, and anti-racism.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:23:41):**  Could you introduce yourself and, yeah, in whatever ways you want.  I'm mumbling on, people.  Alright, so I'm Carol Wright and we're here in Peabody Blackfriars Community Garden.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:23:54):**  I set this up with the residents about nine years ago.  It's the third community garden that I supported residents to set up on housing estates in Southwark.  Setting up these gardens is a form of nurturing and sanctuary,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:24:12):**  even though, you know, local authority, Housing Association, call them community gardens,  they are to me healing spaces because once you step in, you just shut off from everything.  It just comes on you.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:24:26):**  That just quiet, the contemplation, you can just sit here all day.  It feels really connected to the land and considering it's zone one London,  you never understand the power of that.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:24:40):**  And to just know that you've created a space that people can feel comfortable and relaxed and protected in, you know.  And very rare for black people to be afforded that.  You were talking a bit about the land and something I think about a lot is with London and with Britain,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:25:02):**  it's like the history of this land and how it's such a violent place in a lot of ways.  Like healing the land and that sort of relationship.  So that was one thing I wondered if maybe you wanted to talk a bit.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:25:14):**  Because to me, this land that this is on and that this whole estate and on much of this part of London,  it's full of violence and poison.  This land is poisoned land because there were so many tin factories and tanneries  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:25:30):**  and people just dying through poverty.  How is it that you can have in a five minute walk from Blackfriars Road, whichever direction you go,  you would have had how many different prisons?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:25:44):**  So the violence is always there and even the first garden, Brookwood, that's built on a bomb site.  So we do have to do things to not only treat the soil but treat the spirit of this land around here.  And I feel it. I feel it on here.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:26:00):**  I feel it when I walk in this estate and this patriarchal housing association and it doesn't change.  It just has a different face.  And you think, you know who was here before?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:26:14):**  You know, it's people who had to say sorry.  And then you build these housing associations 150 years ago and you have to be good.  There's something about being made to say sorry and thank you  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:26:28):**  when you've impoverished people.  And then of course, how did those people get the money to build these properties?  And of course we have to look to Caribbean, Asia and Africa.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:26:40):**  Of course it's connected to our ancestors.  So as we make our way through this land, I can just hear the voices.  So I look at this very differently when I'm doing these projects here or just relaxing about  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:26:55):**  because you can still feel the violence in how we're treated  because it's so embedded and it's ingrained in the soil and this land.  You know, nobody in their right mind thinks a tarmac is a good thing to put on the floor for people to walk on.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:27:10):**  But yeah, it's okay.  It's okay because then working class people live there.  They're not entitled to touching the soil and being part of decisions about the land and who gets the land.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:27:23):**  And to me, this is the statement with these community gardens.  It's important to stand up there and go, I'm standing here.  Something else I wanted to ask you was you talked a little bit about being like a black woman  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:27:40):**  and like how that is seen in these spaces.  Do you want to just talk a bit more about that?  Yeah. First you're seen as difficult.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:27:47):**  You're seen as difficult if you are not seen to comply.  There's ways that people try to make you feel your voice shouldn't be heard.  We can go in the shed, you know.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:01):**  Come, let's go in the shed because now it's rainy.  We'll have all that rain.  Yeah, I could actually hear it.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:07):**  Thank you. Do you want your backpack?  Yeah, let me take this.  Nice little shed. The shed will be happy.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:15):**  Yeah, we've got like tables and chairs in that back end.  Foxes live underneath.  Of course, local language.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah, yeah, then come there.  There we go. Come on.  Little sanctuary, I told you. It's quiet.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:28):**  Yeah, so being a black woman in these spaces, to me doing these projects about holding space  and saying yes, I have a right to be here in this community garden, helping people to set up these spaces.  And I know that worries those who consider themselves to be in charge because it's like,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:49):**  why are you holding space? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that?  And I want to be involved and you have to listen to me.  It's like, no, no, mm-mm.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:28:58):**  What we're doing is we have to meet to understand that we're alive.  We're living and not just existing in these spaces.  And it's exciting. I get excited by what can this space be?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:29:14):**  Who wants to come and get involved in this space?  What type of music or creativity amongst the plants can we get up to in this space?  So we've had acoustic music, head massage, films.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:29:30):**  It's like anything's possible.  And I think that that, apart from being informed by my Caribbean African heritage,  it's informed by squat culture, DIY ethic.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:29:41):**  That's how I grew up.  It was painting murals on the squat wall.  That was a six-week holiday activity.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:29:51):**  That would be your child mind.  So whatever we have in here, we share.  It's not about pulling in the money. We can do things.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:00):**  Because when we have cinema, the squatters came out of a local pub with the bedsheets and popcorn.  And that to me is cool. This is what it's about.  So people go, oh, I want to go mingle with the squatters.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:11):**  Oh, fleabags, all of this. It's like, just behave yourself here.  Because what you have to understand is possessions is nine-tenths of the law, yeah.  Because you have to look about land rights.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:21):**  It don't matter that we're here in Zone 1 London.  You have to look at land rights.  Because you see all those laws against the squatters. What is that?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:29):**  All these acts of violence. So it's okay to die on the streets through hyperphobia then and hunger.  That's okay. And all these buildings laying empty.  And so we have to occupy this space.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:41):**  It just touches my heart. It reminds me of growing up.  If we had food in our house, we'd share it with the neighbours.  My mum worked in catering in the city. She was a pastry chef.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:30:51):**  Come a Friday, she would come home with three bags of food.  And we knew our neighbours never had no food.  So the neighbours would come on a Friday night.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:00):**  And that would be our house full. And people would get fed.  And that just reminded me of growing up.  Like in Caribbean culture, like the partner where you share the money.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:09):**  You pool the resources. And then who needs, pools out that resource.  And to me that's important.  And it's setting up those networks.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:20):**  And that's what I hope happens with these community gardens.  Is that we pool resources.  And that we understand DIY culture and radicalism.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:30):**  Because it is radical to say I'm going to look after myself.  And I'm going to encourage people to come and stand beside me and hold space.  So what I'm about, since going to Jamaica, because I went to Jamaica recently.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:43):**  Is that understanding of the land.  And that family connection.  Which isn't just about your physical family, your blood family.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:31:53):**  But the families you make, whether that's queer, whoever.  And it doesn't matter all the yatter, yatter after black lives matter.  A lot of chat, chat. But at the end of the day, we want real proof of movement.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:32:10):**  Not one or two things.  Because we deserve to be in these spaces.  And hold space. And cultivate the land.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:32:18):**  Because that's what keeps us whole.  Is the food we eat. The people who are with us.  Who nurture us. And that's what these spaces mean to me as a black woman.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:32:31):**  Maybe related to this actually.  I don't know what you think about care and how that intersects.  Because I think sometimes in activism you're feeling like you're always fighting against something.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:32:44):**  And I feel like so much of what you've talked about and what you've been doing.  It's not about fighting against. It's more about creating something for it.  Creating spaces where we can learn to care for things. Nurturing, right?  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:32:56):**  So I don't know if you can talk a bit about that.  I think that self-care is so important because burnout is a very real thing.  Because if you think that you're fighting, fighting all the time.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:33:09):**  What are you actually getting done? You're getting yourself medical attention.  That is what you're getting yourself.  You really have to look after yourself in these spaces. Look after each other.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:33:21):**  There's power in walking away and telling people no. I do know that this year.  I'm very disappointed people. I'm very happy to be looking after myself much better.  And I think it's going and seeing my family and understanding.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:33:34):**  And having more direction in where I need to spend what energy I have.  But particularly BIPOC people have to understand that we are always targeted.  You could just be standing still and people looking at the argument.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:33:48):**  So anytime I look about community programs in this garden or elsewhere.  It's always got to have a very strong self-care element.  I never say, oh, I'm a garden designer or landscape artist. No.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:34:06):**  I'm here to do something creative which uses greenery as its base.  And then we take off from there.  But the main thing is self-care always first and foremost.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:34:21):**  Brilliant. Thank you so much.  What I got from Carol is the importance of I'm standing here claiming your space on the land.  Carol specifically talks about greenery as a starting point.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:35:06):**  And claiming space within that living greenery world.  And just how powerful that is.  Especially within an inner city context.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:35:16):**  And the fact that so many people in that inner city context are black people, people of color.  It's a real act of solidarity with oneself and with your community.  And where you've come from and where you're going to.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:35:32):**  It's like this very nourishing, wholesome experience.  And I thought that was very powerful.  Again, very moving.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:35:41):**  People keep moving me a lot in this.  Yeah, I think the part about being in the city resonated with me as well.  It doesn't matter where you are.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:35:57):**  Land access and greenery is so important.  And it should be available to everyone.  And everyone should be able to be within that.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:36:07):**  I really also appreciated Carol talking about the family connection.  And land.  And she's very clear that family isn't about blood family necessarily.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:36:19):**  But it's like the family that's created through the nourishing on the land and with the land.  And in the connection with this experience of the green spaces.  And just that word.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:36:33):**  That's what keeps us whole.  It's the food we eat, the people who are with us, who nurture us.  Just the idea that there's so many people who don't have access to experiencing that wholeness.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:36:45):**  That seems like a very depleted offering that the city gives to many.  It's about just knowing what you deserve.  Just because you're alive.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:36:58):**  Because you're here.  And it's not really based on much else than that.  But the access to what we all deserve isn't doled out equally.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:37:11):**  But it should be.  I suppose it's a reciprocal thing really for me.  I work as a market gardener.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:37:27):**  So I'm in it all the time.  And lucky enough to live in it too.  It's just quite simply a nurturing space for me.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:37:39):**  I nurture it.  Whether that's weeding, watering, or just encouraging it to be there.  Not getting rid of it.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:37:50):**  Not weeding it out too much.  And then it nurtures me, I guess.  In the sense that it rewards observation.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:01):**  Sort of takes me out of my head.  Puts me right in my body.  Which is really, really important.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:11):**  You know, being in the elements.  Doing a physical job.  I don't see it as mundane, but you know, monotonous work.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:19):**  But you have to concentrate on it.  You really have to concentrate.  So your mind can't wander.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:25):**  It really occupies you.  And sort of puts you into a place where you, you know, you hear the birds sing.  Or you notice stuff around you like that.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:37):**  I think that's just amazing.  That is exactly like where I found confirmation in myself.  Or like kind of switch off this noise in my head of like, you know, am I this enough?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:38:51):**  Or am I that? Or like, where do I belong?  And like when I tap into kind of like interacting with growing, which is something that I'm learning more about.  Like it's something that I haven't done so much independently.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:39:04):**  But it's just a space that I feel makes sense.  Like it's just like, yeah, a space that's still and like grounding.  And yeah, rooting, I guess.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:39:21):**  The day after that I was diagnosed with cancer, I went for a walk in my local park.  And I experienced the most intense joy I'd ever felt before.  Just looking and being with the plants and trees and flowers that I saw there.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:39:39):**  And that was 26 years ago.  Since then, I've drawn great strength from being out in nature and knowing and feeling that I'm a part of this just amazing world.  I do find joy in just observing nature all year round, looking at the moon, the stars, seeing the effects, like just cycles.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:40:06):**  I think being observant outside allows me to ground myself, but in the grounding of myself, I also can find clarity in the things I'm feeling.  I learned to climb outdoors and it's something that I think like doing something physical that like moves your body.  Again, with hiking, that's like kind of strenuous on your body, but like feeling the solidity of a rock or like a path or something like that, the woods.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:40:40):**  Yeah, it makes me feel super connected to something.  Like even when I was walking here, like just being in the rain or just like anything, I think I like the physical, the physical feeling of being in nature a lot.  I guess what has brought me joy from those outside landscapes is like being the observer of how the natural world like ticks over and how it functions without human interaction.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cultivating-justice-episode-2#t=0:41:12):**  Even though there is probably some kind of human interaction, but just watching that very kind of natural basic turning of the seasons and those milestones of when like now where the daffodils are coming out and I'm starting to see bees flying around and watching the bare trees become more populated with greenery and dense foliage.  And to just be able to walk along that and observe it and be present in it has like really brought me quite a lot of joy, I think, because it kind of reaffirmed my place within nature and made me realize that I am a small human on this planet, essentially.

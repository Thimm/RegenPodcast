**[0:00:00-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:00:00):**  Johnny Hansen is an environmentalist who's involved in setting up Northern Ireland's  first community-supported agriculture scheme at Jubilee Farm.  Johnny reports from Jubilee Farm's first community volunteer day and provides a  
**[0:00:23-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:00:23):**  perspective on farming that I think is the first of us on Farmrama.  I'm here in the classroom at Jubilee Farm where we're having our first community volunteer day  and as part of that we've had a short service of dedication as we begin breaking ground in  
**[0:00:39-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:00:39):**  clearing this overgrown wall garden. I'm here with the Reverend Gabriel Farquhar who, before she was  a Presbyterian minister, ran a community horticulture project in Dublin. Gabriel,  I just wanted to ask you about what you felt Christianity has to offer in terms of an  
**[0:00:57-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:00:57):**  agricultural and environmental ethic for the 21st century. Thank you, Johnny. Well,  first of all, what Christianity has to offer goes way, way back to the beginning of time. God,  when he created the world, he made humankind last and then gave us the responsibility of  
**[0:01:18-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:01:18):**  caring for the earth and so it isn't a choice, it is our responsibility to do so. So as Christians,  if we forget that and concentrate on all sorts of theological issues and think that they only  are important, we're forgetting what God has asked us to do as we live in this world and through this  
**[0:01:39-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:01:39):**  life. Also, the whole idea of rest, rest not just for ourselves but for the land, caring for the  land, it was all part of his creation and even on top of that, and I just love this part in the Old  Testament where they talk about leaving the crop around the edge of the field, as it were, for the  
**[0:02:01-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:02:01):**  stranger, for the widow, for the orphan, so thinking of everybody, caring for everybody,  so that's the Old Testament part of it all and the New Testament the same. Gabriel, churches are  often quite large landowners, they often have land immediately around their site or sometimes  
**[0:02:18-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:02:18):**  they own quite large estates and the like. In terms of putting that ethic into practice, what  contribution do you think churches have given, for example, that here we are at Jubilee Farm,  which is itself in the grounds of an estate owned by the Sisters of the Cross and Passion?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:02:37):**  I think first of all it's great that this project is now able to happen here and to bring this  walled garden to life, just like the walled garden that we worked in Old Hallows in Dublin,  and it just gives such pleasure to people, such well-being and better for health. The churches,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:02:59):**  the churches if they're sitting on land are being totally irresponsible to what God wants them to  do. Sometimes they forget, they think, oh we can let it out for profit and yes they can and I suppose  if they let it out at least somebody's going to work the land which is good, but to be a little  
**[0:03:17-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:03:17):**  bit more creative and to use it for allowing others, a bit like this, to use the land and to  guide the people who maybe don't have the resources, don't have access to work in a garden,  to touch a plant, to touch the soil, there are all sorts of creative ways, or in turn to let it be a  
**[0:03:43-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:03:43):**  place where animals can stay and again children can be brought from towns or in a town sometimes,  again plenty of land around churches, open it up and let people enjoy it as it should have been.  We have a project in Ballycarrie where we brought our young people to Malawi and the following year  
**[0:04:04-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:04:04):**  we brought a group back from Malawi and we all worked together, our young people in the village  from the different churches in Ballycarrie and the young people from Malawi and we made what is now  known as the Malawi Garden and that was back in 2001 and it's still going and the churches are  
**[0:04:22-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:04:22):**  responsible each for two beds and they maintain it and if one isn't able to they then look after  the other person so working together and it's beautiful. Thanks Gabriel for that inspiring  example and just as we end our report from Jubilee Farm, here we work with Christians of all  
**[0:04:41-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-31#t=0:04:41):**  denominations which in Northern Ireland in a post-conflict context we feel is really important  but crucially we also welcome people of all backgrounds and belief to this place so that  we can create space for people and for nature to flourish together.

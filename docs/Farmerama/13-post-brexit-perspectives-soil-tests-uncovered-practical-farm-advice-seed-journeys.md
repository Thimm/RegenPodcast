### Farmerama  (Fri, 10 Mar 2017 17:16:46)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, time for another Farmerama. This month I'm tucked away in a little corner of Northern  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:07):**  Italy and I'm really enjoying being in a place which values its food and where it comes from.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:13):**  But Abi and Nigel are back in London and they'll be here shortly to guide you through the show.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:19):**  And it's a really busy one today. We get to know Fit For The Future and Agroecology,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:24):**  two projects doing some really cool work to link up the web of sustainable learnings which  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:28):**  are out there. A bit later on we're both heartened and a little bit crestfallen by what we dig up on  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:35):**  a trip to Cambridge and we cautiously dive into the Brexit debate. We're going to meet three  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:41):**  different farming families and get their thoughts on the issues over a cup of tea.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:45):**  But now I'm very excited that we're joining a future farmer at the start of a very important  
**[0:00:53-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:53):**  journey by sea. One which will end up taking her crew from Scandinavia through Europe on a journey  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:02):**  towards the Middle East. Her passengers are seeds, still to germinate flecks of potential  
**[0:01:10-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:10):**  on their way to a home buried deep in their past. I'm part of an artist collective called  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:29):**  Future Farmers which I founded in 1995 and we are leaving Oslo, Norway September 17th on an  
**[0:01:36-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:36):**  1895 wooden sailboat. The cargo of this sailboat is seven handfuls of ancient grains that we've  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:45):**  been growing for the last three years in Oslo and they're all grains that fell out of production in  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  the early 1900s and have been brought back into production around the 70s and 80s very slowly  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:57):**  and intently by a small group of farmers in Norway. So we're taking these grains on a journey  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:03):**  back to where they were domesticated in the Middle East to Palestine and Istanbul finally  
**[0:02:09-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  where we will have a symposium and we will plant these seeds in a urban farm in Istanbul. The thing  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:17):**  about this project is immediately people just start projecting their imagination into it and  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:22):**  it it it's a way of imagining it's a way of thinking just about these seeds on a journey  
**[0:02:28-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  on a sailboat across the water. What we're trying to do is make people aware of the chain of  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:36):**  production from planting to table you know from farm to table and how that operates in their  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:44):**  everyday life and how most of what we eat is such an invisible chain like maybe we go to the market  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  maybe we don't maybe we only eat out but we're trying to illustrate that chain and to and to  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:56):**  work with people who are making that chain smaller. Highlight local economies who are building robust  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:01):**  systems of resilience and it's quite tricky right because we're all traveling all over the world so  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  we're trying to highlight regions that are working on the idea of building strong local economies and  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:14):**  farmers who are trying to work together which we found often there's either a consortium that's  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:20):**  formed or a co-op of people of farmers who work together it's very hard to be out there on your  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:26):**  own. So the idea is to link different networks and also to highlight those stories because we maybe  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:32):**  we can be pollen that teaches these different regions and communities about practices that  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:38):**  maybe they haven't thought of. One of the main reasons we came to London was Andrew Forbes of  
**[0:03:43-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:43):**  Brockwell Bick. He's a hero of ours and also quite a hero of many of the Nordic grain farmers. He has  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:52):**  been growing old ancient grains I wouldn't say old you know that we had we don't have the right word  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:57):**  for them yet a lot of people say cultural grains but he's been growing these ancient varieties  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:03):**  sometimes for the first time in hundred years or or between 50 and 100 years and bringing them back  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  into production even taking them out of germ plasm for the first time and growing them in public  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:15):**  parks which I just think is the most beautiful and kind of wise way of doing this like doing it  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:22):**  in a public place a space of recreation recreation and I really think public parks are underutilized  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:30):**  or the way the land is used can be much more dynamic so we are bringing seeds to him we're  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  collecting his seeds from this year's harvest and then taking them along on the journey. We're  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:43):**  arriving in London October 1st at the Hermitage Mooring which is near the London Bridge and we'll  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:51):**  be there for three weeks and hopefully we'll be hosting events but I just want to put a shout out  
**[0:04:56-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:56):**  to Hermitage Mooring for giving us a free place to stay in London. That was Amy Francesini,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:21):**  an amazing spirit. It's so great to hear about Amy's project and we've been really inspired by  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:27):**  the seed journey and Nigel and I have been discussing a bit about native and native seeds  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:33):**  or ancient grains and what that means and well you were talking a bit about native breeds and  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:39):**  how important they are. Yeah I mean I'm not a you know dad knows a bit more about the arable  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:45):**  side of things but I'm certainly more my focus is that it's livestock and certainly with regards  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  to livestock I'm a big fan of native traditional breeds so it's kind of like the heirloom or the  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:58):**  you know what is it again? You should call them ancient grains. Yeah it's kind of the ancient  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:06):**  breeds of you see there is a sort of parallel there I think almost with crops. And what are  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:11):**  the benefits of the ancient breeds? Well they've been bred or you know they've developed to  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:18):**  you know make the most of their surroundings almost you know so you know the Sussex cattle  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:24):**  that you know we breed are developed for Sussex and they will fatten on grass so  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:30):**  they're you know they're better for the environment I think as well so yeah. Great.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  Different perspectives post-Brexit. Some voted in, some voted out. But how do farmers feel now?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:42):**  Here's some kitchen table thinking from the days just after the Brexit vote.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:46):**  Here's Monica and Fred Acust otherwise known as mum and dad with their thoughts.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  I think it's just early days and I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:56):**  Yeah I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:58):**  I think it's a good thing that we're all here. I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:09):**  I mean I would hope that whichever government is in power will put some value on home produced food  
**[0:07:19-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  and care for the environment that we live in. It will most likely be better because if they  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:30):**  do away with subsidies then his wife will have to pay for the food and the cost of production.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  You can't live without food so you should pay for what it costs to produce.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  But what about importing food you know food that was getting sucked in from all around the world?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah it's always been a problem but the world is getting that there's a lot more people in the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:53):**  world. Food is more and more difficult to produce, the weather's against us. So I think they'll have  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:59):**  to pay whatever it costs to produce for us. Someone must start again. I think the ex-wife  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  should pay what it costs to produce. It's not to do with whether the farmer survives.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  It's more to do with what they pay for beer what it costs and wine and also on what it costs to  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  produce. So why shouldn't they pay for milk and other food? What it costs to produce is a ridiculous  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  situation to carry on. It's a wealthy country why can't it pay for its food? Why should it be cheap?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:31):**  I think daddy's view is idealistic. Yes it would be great if the housewife paid for the real cost  
**[0:08:42-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:42):**  of food but that seems it's a long way from what we've got at the moment so there's a lot got to  
**[0:08:54-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:54):**  change if that's going to happen. Yes it would be a good idea if people understood what the true  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  cost is but I'm sure there will be rebellion against paying that and the worry is that if  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:15):**  it's cheaper to import that's what the supermarkets will probably try and do. So I think that's a  
**[0:09:24-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:24):**  good thing. I think the power of supermarkets needs to somehow or other be reduced. Thanks to  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:33):**  mum and dad there and just perhaps a little comment to say so obviously dad's reference to  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:41):**  housewives I think that's just be quite an old school term you know terminology which is you know  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:49):**  in this day and age is it's just really you know doesn't really mean too much. What I really loved  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:54):**  about this recording is I felt like it was really honest perspective from your mum and dad and they  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  were being very true. Pretty normal discussion around the kitchen table. And on to our second  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  stop a trip Nigel and I made just days after the Brexit vote was to visit Melanie and Adrian Steele.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:11):**  We were deep in the depths of uncertainty at this point and it's great to hear kind of where we were  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:17):**  at and hear from Melanie and Adrian. Yeah big question is food prices and whether we'll have a situation  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:24):**  where because a lot of the Brexit campaigning seems to be quite populist and along with populist  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  you get a low food tend to get a desire to have a low food price so that will obviously affect  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:37):**  farming. I think in the short term what worries me is because anyone who's exporting and the pound  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:43):**  the drop in the pound has meant the exports are worth more is going to be lulled into a  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:48):**  sense of false security I think possibly and will not be aware enough of the needs to campaign. I  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:55):**  think everyone needs to to think about making their voices heard actually. I think you've got  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:00):**  to look at areas where you can guarantee a steady income just producing a commodity product is going  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:08):**  to be very very difficult to have any form of guarantee about what that's going to be to be  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:13):**  worth. I think the shorter you can make your supply chain the better so the closer you are to the end  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:19):**  consumer then the more likely you are to have stability in your enterprise. Because you think  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  the price is less likely to fluctuate. Well we we're and there's a thing called the commodity  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  cycle the reason why farm supports were set up in the first place even before the EU was to  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:36):**  cushion farmers against the commodity cycle goes from peaks to troughs and without protection in a  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  trough then a lot of farmers will go bust. Simple as that without any form of protection. We don't  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  yet know if there will be that form of protection because as I say some of the the sort of more  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:53):**  libertarian Brexit campaigners are talking about ending farm support and opening us up to  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:01):**  to sort of unrestricted market forces and that would lead I think ultimately to a big consolidation  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:08):**  of farm holdings and would destroy the social purpose of the common agricultural policy which  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:12):**  was to keep people effectively in agriculture for the social reasons as well as purely economic.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:17):**  I think the final point really in terms of when you're talking about my my planning is actually  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:22):**  we have to encompass in the long-term planning the view of climate change and I feel it's a real  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:28):**  shame we've left the EU because he was taking a lead on climate change issues and there's a tendency  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:33):**  amongst sort of populist right-wing politicians to disregard it. I think it's a hoax and I was very  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:38):**  concerned that the climate change deniers were all lined up on the side of Brexit. We will have to  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:45):**  consider I did mention possibly agroforestry I think that if the climate does continue to warm  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:50):**  particularly winter months then the idea of mixing in with with trees into our enterprise would be  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:57):**  an interesting option not necessarily good in terms of we don't want climate change but we have  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  to accept it's happening but in terms of reducing sheep and increasing cattle sheep are the most  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:10):**  will be the most exposed sector to global trade and being kicked out of the single market  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:15):**  as the European Union is by far our biggest marketplace. Actually I'm really really keen  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:20):**  to make in people's mind is the one that there is between what we call traditional sort of mixed  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  farming and biodiversity so that if they're buying food that is produced on a mixed farm  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:32):**  they're also partly preserving a landscape and also all the biodiversity that goes with that  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:40):**  landscape and I don't think that message has got across strongly enough. I agree like even  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  if you buy organic that doesn't actually necessarily mean biodiversity I mean no you'd hope so but  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:51):**  there are actually huge monoculture organic farms yes so that is actually slightly different.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:58):**  It's an ecology message really but it really is quite logical as well when you think it all  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  through and I don't think people have have grasped it. I don't think anyone mentioned  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:11):**  conservation or environmental issues at all in the Brexit campaigning did they? I think they passed  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:17):**  me by if they did. It was very incidental if it was mentioned at all. Seen as a luxury isn't it?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah yes. I think I'd just say I think we want to start with a very simple question of what do we  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:30):**  want from our farming and what do we want from our food and then from that sort of simple such  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:36):**  a fundamental question about human beings really what then how does that relate to all those issues  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:44):**  you've just mentioned and then we end up hopefully with some sort of realistic debate about what  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:51):**  subsidies are for why you know it justifies them more I think as well because I think at the moment  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  the only sort of atmosphere around subsidies is an economic argument. It would be wonderful if we  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:02):**  could reignite a passion for local food and short supply chains have consumers really wanting to  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:06):**  buy UK projects but I fear that the economic backdrop in the next few years is going to be  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  rather negative and perhaps you know people will be looking to save and not spend. People will be  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:17):**  very anxious I think. A lot of anxiety so we have to bear that in mind it's not going to happen  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:23):**  you know straight away but I think we should not be excited in fact that it's still a very worthwhile  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  idea and objective long term for this country. And finally to friend of the show Ed Hamer who  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:34):**  you may remember regaling us with those wonderful folk songs at the start of the year. I farm a  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:40):**  market garden in Devon called Chag Food Community Market Garden and also work on policy for the Land  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:45):**  Workers Alliance. So my personal perspective is that before the referendum I was very much in  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  favour of remaining a member of the EU and I think it's fair to say although the Land Workers  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:56):**  Alliance went out to consultation beforehand we didn't come back with a clear remit from our  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:02):**  members for whether we should be campaigning actively on either remain or stay. We remained  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:06):**  relatively neutral in the run-up to the referendum but I think it's also fair to say that anecdotally  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:12):**  we know that the majority of our membership were in favour of remaining in the EU. I think that's  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:17):**  largely the reasons they're very similar to my own was that we believed the European Union  
**[0:16:22-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:22):**  represented very much a moderating effect on UK agriculture. Certainly the 2013 reform of the  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:30):**  common agricultural policy led as it was by Dasjon Cholios who was a commissioner from Romania with a  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:36):**  family history in small-scale farming. He very much understood the plight of small-scale  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:43):**  ecological farmers across the EU and as a result he was able to introduce into the 2013 reforms  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:49):**  several concrete pieces of legislation policy recommendations that were actively supportive  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:56):**  of farmers like ourselves. The first one he identified was a small farmer scheme which was  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:01):**  an option of modulating 20% of the national envelope of payments directly to farmers on less  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:08):**  than 20 hectares. There was also an option on capping the individual payments received by the  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:14):**  largest landowners at 150,000 euros a year and then there are also several options on producing  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  bureaucracy for small-scale producers themselves. Regrettably when those regulations were introduced  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  when those reforms were introduced to the UK they were interpreted at the time by the  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:30):**  conservative government and particularly by the environment minister at the time Owen Patterson.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  He was a staunch advocate of large-scale industrial farming and genetic engineering GM crops. His  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:40):**  interpretation of the policy actually made it a lot harder in the economic climate for small-scale  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:46):**  producers to survive and to thrive. Our initial reaction was certainly one of dismay in the sense  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:54):**  that we realize now that we are very much on our own within Europe in two years time we are going  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:59):**  to be and whatever food and farming policy we have going forward we have to fight a lot harder  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:06):**  than perhaps we might have done before to get recognition and support for small-scale ecological  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  producers. How does that change how you're farming day to day? Well in many ways it doesn't we because  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:17):**  we're farming on two hectares we're not eligible for a single farm payment and we're not eligible  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:23):**  for all the environmental support that comes with getting a single farm payment or what is now the  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:27):**  basic payment scheme. So I'd say from a support point of view it won't make a difference you know  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:33):**  what happened pre-Brexit and post-Brexit but the important thing to point out is that we are going  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:37):**  to have a national food and farming policy and if we take the government at their word if we take  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  DEFRA at their word they are open to consultation with any stakeholders who are involved in that  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:48):**  process and as the Land Workers Alliance we see ourselves as an important voice in that room.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:55):**  We see ourselves as being able to articulate a point of view that is not represented by the  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:00):**  National Farmers Union or by the Country Landowners Association and we think it's important our voice  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:06):**  is there. Ed is also policy person at Land Workers Alliance. We will be hearing more from him in  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:12):**  detail about what they are planning to do in the post-Brexit environment soon and this is certainly  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:17):**  a debate which we are going to be coming to again and again. So Nigel obviously your mom and dad  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:24):**  were clear that they voted out. They voted to leave yeah. What was your perspective and where  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:28):**  are you at now? When the outcome was clear that we were we are leaving I was somewhat dismayed  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:35):**  like probably many other farmers that voted to remain but I've come around to the idea that  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:41):**  actually perhaps we can make this a real positive opportunity to move forward and reshape our farming  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:48):**  and food policy here in the UK. Agreed I feel exactly the same like regardless of what you  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:54):**  voted it's like this is how it is and we need to move forward and I think there are lots of  
**[0:19:58-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:58):**  opportunities for the farmers of the future to influence the future policies right now  
**[0:20:07-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:07):**  and that's a really exciting place to be. Our boat was built by Colin Archer who was a famous  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  boat builder and he was known for building the Fromme which was the first boat to make it to the  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:22):**  very far north in the North Pole and that was led by Friedchof Nansen. That was a crazy adventure  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:29):**  because they didn't sail there they slammed the boat into ice and they floated for two years with  
**[0:20:34-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:34):**  the ice to the north. Normally you're very busy on a boat but they had to find things to do so the  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:45):**  captain organized this beautiful library of books and made them read every day so I'm going to read  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:50):**  you some of the titles that were on this journey to the north. Soul, life and intelligence in animals  
**[0:20:57-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:57):**  from the Chinese wall to Japan in the woods science and religion the birds the story that  
**[0:21:06-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  transformed the world great thoughts one through thirteen at the south pole the loss of john humble  
**[0:21:17-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:17):**  the rise of the dutch republic the short story of a long life  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  there's a lot of information out there which could potentially be useful for you  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:35):**  if you're interested in learning more about the history of the dutch republic  
**[0:21:41-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  there's a lot of information out there which could potentially support you on your farms  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  but where to start in terms of finding it all obviously we hope that farmerama is going some  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:55):**  way towards helping here but we're always keen to feature other people who are on the same mission  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  many different organizations across boundaries and labels have grouped together to form agroecology  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  it's a curated knowledge base for ecological farming ideas we hear from Suzanne Padel who  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:11):**  sowed the seeds of agroecology we started off with organic agriculture only Nick Lampkin our  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:16):**  director and Alissa Leake started to produce a report on what agroecology can contribute to  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  sustainable sustainable intensification and that was one joint project where we looked at organic  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:28):**  agriculture integrated agriculture agroforestry permaculture and various different ideas and at  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:34):**  the same time the Dalesford farm and foundation were becoming more and more interested in sharing  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:40):**  the good practice that has been developed here and we agreed that we're going to give this a try  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:45):**  so various different organizations that all have resources to contribute I was aware over many years  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:52):**  that there has been quite a lot of interesting and practical information for farmers but that  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:57):**  would be hard to find because it was this project here that article there something here and there  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:02):**  we wanted the results to be accessible for farmers so practical sustainable agriculture  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  regardless of labels passionate about that we're not trying telling farmers what to do we're trying  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  to offer them opportunities if you're interested in this then this is somebody who has done it if  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:21):**  you would like to know more about cover crops here are some examples we don't want what somebody to  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:26):**  say I can't do this because I'm not organic or because I'm integrated or because I'm  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:31):**  this or because I'm that what we're trying to do is reliable so the information is somewhat vetted  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:36):**  by somebody is from a good source and also if it's not compatible with organic agriculture it  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:42):**  will indicate so so that those that are organic know that this maybe isn't everything for me but  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:48):**  still there's so much to be gained from sharing the knowledge between the non-organic and the  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:54):**  organic partners at the moment because everybody has got a different approach farms are different  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:59):**  you can't find one solution that works for every farm so my our belief is to create opportunities  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:05):**  that farmers can find for themselves and make more informed choices and really if they want to know  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:12):**  this then there might be a resource to help them to answer that question but we don't want to tell  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  anybody this is how you should do it that's not what we are about at all this is not what we try  
**[0:24:21-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  to do and the place to find all those awesome resources is on www.agricology.co.uk one of the  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:31):**  projects featured at the agroecology day was fit for the future network who share information about  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:37):**  sustainable energy projects already in place with people looking to implement similar ideas  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:43):**  everything from reed bed water treatment to solar roofs they can put you in touch with farmers or  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:48):**  organizations who've already got a system in place and fill you in on what works and doesn't  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  more now from sophie mcgovern  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:57):**  i'm sophie i work for fit for the future network which is a partnership between the national trust  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:04):**  and a sustainability charity called ashton we're three years in now and our mission is to make  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:10):**  sure that all land and property owning organizations are sharing best practice and  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  collaborating to become more sustainable and so we do this in various ways we enable the sharing  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:21):**  of knowledge and expertise by linking people up who are working on similar projects by organizing  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:27):**  site visits and events and it makes a huge difference if you can bypass the contractors  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:32):**  and the installers and go straight to somebody else who's already done it can tell you what  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:36):**  works what doesn't work and help you along with your own projects so for example when  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:41):**  scottish canals were putting together their sustainability strategy for the next few years  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  they wanted to see what another organization had done so they visited their halfordy clan farm  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:52):**  in wales which is a national trust farm to see the renewables that have been installed there  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:58):**  and so they saw a large-scale hydro project solar solar array and biomass heat pumps and learned  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:05):**  about what had worked well there and what hadn't worked so that they could form their own plans  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:08):**  and up in scotland so whether you want to put some solar panels on them maybe an old farm building  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:16):**  just to just to power that building itself or if you want to build a solar array that will actually  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:21):**  feed back into the grid we work right through from very small scale to large scale projects as well  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:27):**  thanks so much sophie great to hear about that project on the day yeah the day was fabulous and  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:32):**  mainly because we heard from like 10 or 15 different projects a lot of different speakers and  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:38):**  and different kind of bodies all feeding into agroecology so i think it was nice to hear from  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:43):**  some of the the heads of these different organizations and what they're doing and their  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:48):**  perspectives and it was kind of interesting to see this mixed knowledge base in action because  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  there were some farmers who were like avidly organic there are some farmers who are really  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:57):**  into trees and there were some who uh you know used some chemicals and and everyone was kind  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  of interacting and sharing what they had learned and i i always find that so promising um when  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:13):**  people just kind of get over their differences in opinion and share what works quite a few of the  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:18):**  projects were farmer led and we were hearing directly from farmers who had already implemented  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:22):**  things and i think that's one of the keys it's very hard to you know find that information what  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  farmers are looking for is exactly what really works on the ground as a nitty gritty the nitty  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:35):**  gritty which is what we're all about yeah and i found that really exciting and that's i think  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:42):**  that you know one of the things we've learned is that farmers learn best from other farmers  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:47):**  if you've seen it in action there's nothing like that to convince you that it might work for you too  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:51):**  you  
**[0:27:58-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  oslo vele london cardiff entorp gijon asturias mayorka rome haifa istanbul  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:14):**  and finally we were totally bowled over as we uncovered the real story behind soil tests at the  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:19):**  national trust soils training day national trust farmer richard morris was perplexed by soil tests  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:26):**  showing some potentially worrying results but stephen breaks the soil specialist at innovation  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:32):**  for agriculture was on hand with some revelations i've been particularly interested in a number of  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:37):**  years in soil organic matter and the soil carbon that's tied up with the soil and the soil  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:42):**  structure and the soil carbon that's tied up with that and looking to improve that as we improve it  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:46):**  the soil structure improves and our yields improve something that's been concerning me through our  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:51):**  organic conversion is phosphates the measure as farmers we've used for years the phosphate indices  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:58):**  has been declining quite rapidly and i've been sort of quite worried about whether i'd continue  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:03):**  to get good germination rates and hence decent yields from the land stephen breaks uh soil and  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:10):**  water manager for innovation for agriculture the the answer to that really is that the index based  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:16):**  soil analysis methods are really only measuring the phosphate that's in solution and plant  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:23):**  available at any point in time when we are in reality there's a great deal more phosphate  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:29):**  in reserve in the soil which isn't being measured by that methodology but as one improves soil  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:37):**  management through high levels of organic matter and better biological activity that biology in  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:43):**  turn then mineralizes phosphate into available forms for the plant so there's a lot more phosphate  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:50):**  in the soil in the reserve account which we can bring into the current account make available to  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:55):**  plants through better soil management better soil biology current analysis methods with index based  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:02):**  systems to start measuring that the the accepted methodologies for measurement really are just  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:08):**  measuring the amount of nutrients like phosphates that we need to apply to meet crop nutrition  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:16):**  they're not measuring what's in the soil at all reserves are usually far greater i use the analogy  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:22):**  of it's like having a current account where you're making small deposits and quick withdrawals but  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:28):**  also having a big reserve account and it's how do we access that reserve account and bring some of  
**[0:30:34-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:34):**  those long-term reserves of phosphate into an available form and that's really through biology  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:41):**  and feeding the biology with soil organic matter is absolutely fundamental so we have to we have  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:47):**  to look at what we're measuring in different ways to fully understand that the all break system of  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:53):**  measurement is is looking at the balances of magnesium calcium phosphate calcium and trying  
**[0:31:01-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:01):**  to establish balances or ratios between those to try and balance the soil mineralogy to make it  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:13):**  have the potential to perform in the best way possible and so what the all break system is  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:18):**  doing is looking not only at the plant available forms but the reserve forms of minerals phosphate  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:24):**  magnesium calcium etc so trying to understand those reserve levels and what we can do to try  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:29):**  and unlock those the other the other sort of third level to that is starting to look at biological  
**[0:31:35-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:35):**  assessments of biology in terms of fungi bacteria mycorrhizae nematodes and microbiology and trying  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:47):**  to look at how we can feed that biology to make it work for us so that we can become  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:52):**  subterranean livestock farmers you know you live and learn i could see the indices going down on  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:57):**  on the test and the measures we took um but our crop yield and crop health is actually has been  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:02):**  increasing for the last seven years as we've got further into the organic conversion so that is  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:07):**  it's a great indicator that we we are achieving what we set out to achieve improvement in soil  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:13):**  health um and an aside to that the the sort of biodiversity the natural habitat and the um the  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:20):**  bugs and the beasts that live around our farm have increased tremendously and hence um farmland birds  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:26):**  who knew that soil tests don't really tell you what's in the soil i was like totally  
**[0:32:33-0:32:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:33):**  flabbergasted by that insight and i just found it kind of very disconcerting that these long-term  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:41):**  norms continue to define how we perceive things and and it was one way that kind of conventional  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:48):**  agriculture still had a hold on our understanding of soil to me i had always understood soil tests  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:53):**  as being scientifically correct but actually you know even though richard knew he was regenerating  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:59):**  his soil the science was saying otherwise for me this was crazy because like even on our farm in  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:06):**  chile you know everyone keeps saying oh you should do soil tests and you should test all parts of your  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:11):**  soil to see what you need to put here and there and my dad has always been like well the tests  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:17):**  aren't that helpful like they weren't helping him figure things out you know a big part of it  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:21):**  is like listening you know it's it's like watching and listening to the land isn't it and seeing how  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:26):**  crops respond and i think you can tell almost as much from that as from you know the different mpk  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:33):**  levels or something like that which is obviously the kind of the conventional way of testing soil  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:38):**  so it's a lot more to it it's just really important that as this regenerative agriculture  
**[0:33:44-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:44):**  practice develops that we alongside it have the science develop with it because otherwise you can  
**[0:33:52-0:34:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:52):**  just see that these principles will hold us back for now bye thank you to every one of you for  
**[0:34:10-0:34:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:10):**  listening something all of you can do to help is write us a review on itunes because it's really  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:18):**  good at getting us noticed in any way you can share the show with your farmer friends is of  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:21):**  course appreciated we're also really keen to hear what you enjoy and what you don't and what we can  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:28):**  do to make this program useful and enjoyable for you and we'll be back next month hopefully with  
**[0:34:36-0:34:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:36):**  all this together in the same place you

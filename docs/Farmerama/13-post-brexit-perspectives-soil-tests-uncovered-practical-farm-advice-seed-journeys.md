### Farmerama  (2017-03-10)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, time for another Farmerama. This month I'm tucked away in a little corner of Northern  Italy and I'm really enjoying being in a place which values its food and where it comes from.  But Abi and Nigel are back in London and they'll be here shortly to guide you through the show.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:19):**  And it's a really busy one today. We get to know Fit For The Future and Agroecology,  two projects doing some really cool work to link up the web of sustainable learnings which  are out there. A bit later on we're both heartened and a little bit crestfallen by what we dig up on  
**[0:00:35-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:35):**  a trip to Cambridge and we cautiously dive into the Brexit debate. We're going to meet three  different farming families and get their thoughts on the issues over a cup of tea.  But now I'm very excited that we're joining a future farmer at the start of a very important  
**[0:00:53-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:00:53):**  journey by sea. One which will end up taking her crew from Scandinavia through Europe on a journey  towards the Middle East. Her passengers are seeds, still to germinate flecks of potential  on their way to a home buried deep in their past. I'm part of an artist collective called  
**[0:01:29-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:29):**  Future Farmers which I founded in 1995 and we are leaving Oslo, Norway September 17th on an  1895 wooden sailboat. The cargo of this sailboat is seven handfuls of ancient grains that we've  been growing for the last three years in Oslo and they're all grains that fell out of production in  
**[0:01:51-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  the early 1900s and have been brought back into production around the 70s and 80s very slowly  and intently by a small group of farmers in Norway. So we're taking these grains on a journey  back to where they were domesticated in the Middle East to Palestine and Istanbul finally  
**[0:02:09-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  where we will have a symposium and we will plant these seeds in a urban farm in Istanbul. The thing  about this project is immediately people just start projecting their imagination into it and  it it it's a way of imagining it's a way of thinking just about these seeds on a journey  
**[0:02:28-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  on a sailboat across the water. What we're trying to do is make people aware of the chain of  production from planting to table you know from farm to table and how that operates in their  everyday life and how most of what we eat is such an invisible chain like maybe we go to the market  
**[0:02:51-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  maybe we don't maybe we only eat out but we're trying to illustrate that chain and to and to  work with people who are making that chain smaller. Highlight local economies who are building robust  systems of resilience and it's quite tricky right because we're all traveling all over the world so  
**[0:03:08-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  we're trying to highlight regions that are working on the idea of building strong local economies and  farmers who are trying to work together which we found often there's either a consortium that's  formed or a co-op of people of farmers who work together it's very hard to be out there on your  
**[0:03:26-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:26):**  own. So the idea is to link different networks and also to highlight those stories because we maybe  we can be pollen that teaches these different regions and communities about practices that  maybe they haven't thought of. One of the main reasons we came to London was Andrew Forbes of  
**[0:03:43-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:03:43):**  Brockwell Bick. He's a hero of ours and also quite a hero of many of the Nordic grain farmers. He has  been growing old ancient grains I wouldn't say old you know that we had we don't have the right word  for them yet a lot of people say cultural grains but he's been growing these ancient varieties  
**[0:04:03-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:03):**  sometimes for the first time in hundred years or or between 50 and 100 years and bringing them back  into production even taking them out of germ plasm for the first time and growing them in public  parks which I just think is the most beautiful and kind of wise way of doing this like doing it  
**[0:04:22-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:22):**  in a public place a space of recreation recreation and I really think public parks are underutilized  or the way the land is used can be much more dynamic so we are bringing seeds to him we're  collecting his seeds from this year's harvest and then taking them along on the journey. We're  
**[0:04:43-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:04:43):**  arriving in London October 1st at the Hermitage Mooring which is near the London Bridge and we'll  be there for three weeks and hopefully we'll be hosting events but I just want to put a shout out  to Hermitage Mooring for giving us a free place to stay in London. That was Amy Francesini,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:21):**  an amazing spirit. It's so great to hear about Amy's project and we've been really inspired by  the seed journey and Nigel and I have been discussing a bit about native and native seeds  or ancient grains and what that means and well you were talking a bit about native breeds and  
**[0:05:39-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:39):**  how important they are. Yeah I mean I'm not a you know dad knows a bit more about the arable  side of things but I'm certainly more my focus is that it's livestock and certainly with regards  to livestock I'm a big fan of native traditional breeds so it's kind of like the heirloom or the  
**[0:05:58-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:05:58):**  you know what is it again? You should call them ancient grains. Yeah it's kind of the ancient  breeds of you see there is a sort of parallel there I think almost with crops. And what are  the benefits of the ancient breeds? Well they've been bred or you know they've developed to  
**[0:06:18-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:18):**  you know make the most of their surroundings almost you know so you know the Sussex cattle  that you know we breed are developed for Sussex and they will fatten on grass so  they're you know they're better for the environment I think as well so yeah. Great.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  Different perspectives post-Brexit. Some voted in, some voted out. But how do farmers feel now?  Here's some kitchen table thinking from the days just after the Brexit vote.  Here's Monica and Fred Acust otherwise known as mum and dad with their thoughts.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  I think it's just early days and I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  Yeah I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  I think it's a good thing that we're all here. I think it's a good thing that we're all here.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:09):**  I mean I would hope that whichever government is in power will put some value on home produced food  and care for the environment that we live in. It will most likely be better because if they  do away with subsidies then his wife will have to pay for the food and the cost of production.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  You can't live without food so you should pay for what it costs to produce.  But what about importing food you know food that was getting sucked in from all around the world?  Yeah it's always been a problem but the world is getting that there's a lot more people in the  
**[0:07:53-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:07:53):**  world. Food is more and more difficult to produce, the weather's against us. So I think they'll have  to pay whatever it costs to produce for us. Someone must start again. I think the ex-wife  should pay what it costs to produce. It's not to do with whether the farmer survives.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  It's more to do with what they pay for beer what it costs and wine and also on what it costs to  produce. So why shouldn't they pay for milk and other food? What it costs to produce is a ridiculous  situation to carry on. It's a wealthy country why can't it pay for its food? Why should it be cheap?  
**[0:08:31-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:08:31):**  I think daddy's view is idealistic. Yes it would be great if the housewife paid for the real cost  of food but that seems it's a long way from what we've got at the moment so there's a lot got to  change if that's going to happen. Yes it would be a good idea if people understood what the true  
**[0:09:07-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  cost is but I'm sure there will be rebellion against paying that and the worry is that if  it's cheaper to import that's what the supermarkets will probably try and do. So I think that's a  good thing. I think the power of supermarkets needs to somehow or other be reduced. Thanks to  
**[0:09:33-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:33):**  mum and dad there and just perhaps a little comment to say so obviously dad's reference to  housewives I think that's just be quite an old school term you know terminology which is you know  in this day and age is it's just really you know doesn't really mean too much. What I really loved  
**[0:09:54-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:09:54):**  about this recording is I felt like it was really honest perspective from your mum and dad and they  were being very true. Pretty normal discussion around the kitchen table. And on to our second  stop a trip Nigel and I made just days after the Brexit vote was to visit Melanie and Adrian Steele.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:11):**  We were deep in the depths of uncertainty at this point and it's great to hear kind of where we were  at and hear from Melanie and Adrian. Yeah big question is food prices and whether we'll have a situation  where because a lot of the Brexit campaigning seems to be quite populist and along with populist  
**[0:10:29-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  you get a low food tend to get a desire to have a low food price so that will obviously affect  farming. I think in the short term what worries me is because anyone who's exporting and the pound  the drop in the pound has meant the exports are worth more is going to be lulled into a  
**[0:10:48-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:10:48):**  sense of false security I think possibly and will not be aware enough of the needs to campaign. I  think everyone needs to to think about making their voices heard actually. I think you've got  to look at areas where you can guarantee a steady income just producing a commodity product is going  
**[0:11:08-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:08):**  to be very very difficult to have any form of guarantee about what that's going to be to be  worth. I think the shorter you can make your supply chain the better so the closer you are to the end  consumer then the more likely you are to have stability in your enterprise. Because you think  
**[0:11:26-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  the price is less likely to fluctuate. Well we we're and there's a thing called the commodity  cycle the reason why farm supports were set up in the first place even before the EU was to  cushion farmers against the commodity cycle goes from peaks to troughs and without protection in a  
**[0:11:42-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  trough then a lot of farmers will go bust. Simple as that without any form of protection. We don't  yet know if there will be that form of protection because as I say some of the the sort of more  libertarian Brexit campaigners are talking about ending farm support and opening us up to  
**[0:12:01-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:01):**  to sort of unrestricted market forces and that would lead I think ultimately to a big consolidation  of farm holdings and would destroy the social purpose of the common agricultural policy which  was to keep people effectively in agriculture for the social reasons as well as purely economic.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:17):**  I think the final point really in terms of when you're talking about my my planning is actually  we have to encompass in the long-term planning the view of climate change and I feel it's a real  shame we've left the EU because he was taking a lead on climate change issues and there's a tendency  
**[0:12:33-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:33):**  amongst sort of populist right-wing politicians to disregard it. I think it's a hoax and I was very  concerned that the climate change deniers were all lined up on the side of Brexit. We will have to  consider I did mention possibly agroforestry I think that if the climate does continue to warm  
**[0:12:50-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:12:50):**  particularly winter months then the idea of mixing in with with trees into our enterprise would be  an interesting option not necessarily good in terms of we don't want climate change but we have  to accept it's happening but in terms of reducing sheep and increasing cattle sheep are the most  
**[0:13:10-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:10):**  will be the most exposed sector to global trade and being kicked out of the single market  as the European Union is by far our biggest marketplace. Actually I'm really really keen  to make in people's mind is the one that there is between what we call traditional sort of mixed  
**[0:13:26-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  farming and biodiversity so that if they're buying food that is produced on a mixed farm  they're also partly preserving a landscape and also all the biodiversity that goes with that  landscape and I don't think that message has got across strongly enough. I agree like even  
**[0:13:46-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  if you buy organic that doesn't actually necessarily mean biodiversity I mean no you'd hope so but  there are actually huge monoculture organic farms yes so that is actually slightly different.  It's an ecology message really but it really is quite logical as well when you think it all  
**[0:14:03-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  through and I don't think people have have grasped it. I don't think anyone mentioned  conservation or environmental issues at all in the Brexit campaigning did they? I think they passed  me by if they did. It was very incidental if it was mentioned at all. Seen as a luxury isn't it?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah yes. I think I'd just say I think we want to start with a very simple question of what do we  want from our farming and what do we want from our food and then from that sort of simple such  a fundamental question about human beings really what then how does that relate to all those issues  
**[0:14:44-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:14:44):**  you've just mentioned and then we end up hopefully with some sort of realistic debate about what  subsidies are for why you know it justifies them more I think as well because I think at the moment  the only sort of atmosphere around subsidies is an economic argument. It would be wonderful if we  
**[0:15:02-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:02):**  could reignite a passion for local food and short supply chains have consumers really wanting to  buy UK projects but I fear that the economic backdrop in the next few years is going to be  rather negative and perhaps you know people will be looking to save and not spend. People will be  
**[0:15:17-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:17):**  very anxious I think. A lot of anxiety so we have to bear that in mind it's not going to happen  you know straight away but I think we should not be excited in fact that it's still a very worthwhile  idea and objective long term for this country. And finally to friend of the show Ed Hamer who  
**[0:15:34-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:34):**  you may remember regaling us with those wonderful folk songs at the start of the year. I farm a  market garden in Devon called Chag Food Community Market Garden and also work on policy for the Land  Workers Alliance. So my personal perspective is that before the referendum I was very much in  
**[0:15:51-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  favour of remaining a member of the EU and I think it's fair to say although the Land Workers  Alliance went out to consultation beforehand we didn't come back with a clear remit from our  members for whether we should be campaigning actively on either remain or stay. We remained  
**[0:16:06-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:06):**  relatively neutral in the run-up to the referendum but I think it's also fair to say that anecdotally  we know that the majority of our membership were in favour of remaining in the EU. I think that's  largely the reasons they're very similar to my own was that we believed the European Union  
**[0:16:22-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:22):**  represented very much a moderating effect on UK agriculture. Certainly the 2013 reform of the  common agricultural policy led as it was by Dasjon Cholios who was a commissioner from Romania with a  family history in small-scale farming. He very much understood the plight of small-scale  
**[0:16:43-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:16:43):**  ecological farmers across the EU and as a result he was able to introduce into the 2013 reforms  several concrete pieces of legislation policy recommendations that were actively supportive  of farmers like ourselves. The first one he identified was a small farmer scheme which was  
**[0:17:01-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:01):**  an option of modulating 20% of the national envelope of payments directly to farmers on less  than 20 hectares. There was also an option on capping the individual payments received by the  largest landowners at 150,000 euros a year and then there are also several options on producing  
**[0:17:19-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  bureaucracy for small-scale producers themselves. Regrettably when those regulations were introduced  when those reforms were introduced to the UK they were interpreted at the time by the  conservative government and particularly by the environment minister at the time Owen Patterson.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  He was a staunch advocate of large-scale industrial farming and genetic engineering GM crops. His  interpretation of the policy actually made it a lot harder in the economic climate for small-scale  producers to survive and to thrive. Our initial reaction was certainly one of dismay in the sense  
**[0:17:54-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:17:54):**  that we realize now that we are very much on our own within Europe in two years time we are going  to be and whatever food and farming policy we have going forward we have to fight a lot harder  than perhaps we might have done before to get recognition and support for small-scale ecological  
**[0:18:11-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  producers. How does that change how you're farming day to day? Well in many ways it doesn't we because  we're farming on two hectares we're not eligible for a single farm payment and we're not eligible  for all the environmental support that comes with getting a single farm payment or what is now the  
**[0:18:27-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:27):**  basic payment scheme. So I'd say from a support point of view it won't make a difference you know  what happened pre-Brexit and post-Brexit but the important thing to point out is that we are going  to have a national food and farming policy and if we take the government at their word if we take  
**[0:18:42-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  DEFRA at their word they are open to consultation with any stakeholders who are involved in that  process and as the Land Workers Alliance we see ourselves as an important voice in that room.  We see ourselves as being able to articulate a point of view that is not represented by the  
**[0:19:00-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:00):**  National Farmers Union or by the Country Landowners Association and we think it's important our voice  is there. Ed is also policy person at Land Workers Alliance. We will be hearing more from him in  detail about what they are planning to do in the post-Brexit environment soon and this is certainly  
**[0:19:17-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:17):**  a debate which we are going to be coming to again and again. So Nigel obviously your mom and dad  were clear that they voted out. They voted to leave yeah. What was your perspective and where  are you at now? When the outcome was clear that we were we are leaving I was somewhat dismayed  
**[0:19:35-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:35):**  like probably many other farmers that voted to remain but I've come around to the idea that  actually perhaps we can make this a real positive opportunity to move forward and reshape our farming  and food policy here in the UK. Agreed I feel exactly the same like regardless of what you  
**[0:19:54-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:19:54):**  voted it's like this is how it is and we need to move forward and I think there are lots of  opportunities for the farmers of the future to influence the future policies right now  and that's a really exciting place to be. Our boat was built by Colin Archer who was a famous  
**[0:20:17-0:20:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  boat builder and he was known for building the Fromme which was the first boat to make it to the  very far north in the North Pole and that was led by Friedchof Nansen. That was a crazy adventure  because they didn't sail there they slammed the boat into ice and they floated for two years with  
**[0:20:34-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:34):**  the ice to the north. Normally you're very busy on a boat but they had to find things to do so the  captain organized this beautiful library of books and made them read every day so I'm going to read  you some of the titles that were on this journey to the north. Soul, life and intelligence in animals  
**[0:20:57-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:20:57):**  from the Chinese wall to Japan in the woods science and religion the birds the story that  transformed the world great thoughts one through thirteen at the south pole the loss of john humble  the rise of the dutch republic the short story of a long life  
**[0:21:28-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  there's a lot of information out there which could potentially be useful for you  if you're interested in learning more about the history of the dutch republic  there's a lot of information out there which could potentially support you on your farms  
**[0:21:50-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  but where to start in terms of finding it all obviously we hope that farmerama is going some  way towards helping here but we're always keen to feature other people who are on the same mission  many different organizations across boundaries and labels have grouped together to form agroecology  
**[0:22:05-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  it's a curated knowledge base for ecological farming ideas we hear from Suzanne Padel who  sowed the seeds of agroecology we started off with organic agriculture only Nick Lampkin our  director and Alissa Leake started to produce a report on what agroecology can contribute to  
**[0:22:21-0:22:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  sustainable sustainable intensification and that was one joint project where we looked at organic  agriculture integrated agriculture agroforestry permaculture and various different ideas and at  the same time the Dalesford farm and foundation were becoming more and more interested in sharing  
**[0:22:40-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:40):**  the good practice that has been developed here and we agreed that we're going to give this a try  so various different organizations that all have resources to contribute I was aware over many years  that there has been quite a lot of interesting and practical information for farmers but that  
**[0:22:57-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:22:57):**  would be hard to find because it was this project here that article there something here and there  we wanted the results to be accessible for farmers so practical sustainable agriculture  regardless of labels passionate about that we're not trying telling farmers what to do we're trying  
**[0:23:16-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  to offer them opportunities if you're interested in this then this is somebody who has done it if  you would like to know more about cover crops here are some examples we don't want what somebody to  say I can't do this because I'm not organic or because I'm integrated or because I'm  
**[0:23:31-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:31):**  this or because I'm that what we're trying to do is reliable so the information is somewhat vetted  by somebody is from a good source and also if it's not compatible with organic agriculture it  will indicate so so that those that are organic know that this maybe isn't everything for me but  
**[0:23:48-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:23:48):**  still there's so much to be gained from sharing the knowledge between the non-organic and the  organic partners at the moment because everybody has got a different approach farms are different  you can't find one solution that works for every farm so my our belief is to create opportunities  
**[0:24:05-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:05):**  that farmers can find for themselves and make more informed choices and really if they want to know  this then there might be a resource to help them to answer that question but we don't want to tell  anybody this is how you should do it that's not what we are about at all this is not what we try  
**[0:24:21-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  to do and the place to find all those awesome resources is on www.agricology.co.uk one of the  projects featured at the agroecology day was fit for the future network who share information about  sustainable energy projects already in place with people looking to implement similar ideas  
**[0:24:43-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:43):**  everything from reed bed water treatment to solar roofs they can put you in touch with farmers or  organizations who've already got a system in place and fill you in on what works and doesn't  more now from sophie mcgovern  
**[0:24:57-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:24:57):**  i'm sophie i work for fit for the future network which is a partnership between the national trust  and a sustainability charity called ashton we're three years in now and our mission is to make  sure that all land and property owning organizations are sharing best practice and  
**[0:25:15-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  collaborating to become more sustainable and so we do this in various ways we enable the sharing  of knowledge and expertise by linking people up who are working on similar projects by organizing  site visits and events and it makes a huge difference if you can bypass the contractors  
**[0:25:32-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:32):**  and the installers and go straight to somebody else who's already done it can tell you what  works what doesn't work and help you along with your own projects so for example when  scottish canals were putting together their sustainability strategy for the next few years  
**[0:25:46-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  they wanted to see what another organization had done so they visited their halfordy clan farm  in wales which is a national trust farm to see the renewables that have been installed there  and so they saw a large-scale hydro project solar solar array and biomass heat pumps and learned  
**[0:26:05-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:05):**  about what had worked well there and what hadn't worked so that they could form their own plans  and up in scotland so whether you want to put some solar panels on them maybe an old farm building  just to just to power that building itself or if you want to build a solar array that will actually  
**[0:26:21-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:21):**  feed back into the grid we work right through from very small scale to large scale projects as well  thanks so much sophie great to hear about that project on the day yeah the day was fabulous and  mainly because we heard from like 10 or 15 different projects a lot of different speakers and  
**[0:26:38-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:38):**  and different kind of bodies all feeding into agroecology so i think it was nice to hear from  some of the the heads of these different organizations and what they're doing and their  perspectives and it was kind of interesting to see this mixed knowledge base in action because  
**[0:26:54-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  there were some farmers who were like avidly organic there are some farmers who are really  into trees and there were some who uh you know used some chemicals and and everyone was kind  of interacting and sharing what they had learned and i i always find that so promising um when  
**[0:27:13-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:13):**  people just kind of get over their differences in opinion and share what works quite a few of the  projects were farmer led and we were hearing directly from farmers who had already implemented  things and i think that's one of the keys it's very hard to you know find that information what  
**[0:27:29-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  farmers are looking for is exactly what really works on the ground as a nitty gritty the nitty  gritty which is what we're all about yeah and i found that really exciting and that's i think  that you know one of the things we've learned is that farmers learn best from other farmers  
**[0:27:47-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:27:47):**  if you've seen it in action there's nothing like that to convince you that it might work for you too  you  oslo vele london cardiff entorp gijon asturias mayorka rome haifa istanbul  
**[0:28:14-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:14):**  and finally we were totally bowled over as we uncovered the real story behind soil tests at the  national trust soils training day national trust farmer richard morris was perplexed by soil tests  showing some potentially worrying results but stephen breaks the soil specialist at innovation  
**[0:28:32-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:32):**  for agriculture was on hand with some revelations i've been particularly interested in a number of  years in soil organic matter and the soil carbon that's tied up with the soil and the soil  structure and the soil carbon that's tied up with that and looking to improve that as we improve it  
**[0:28:46-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:28:46):**  the soil structure improves and our yields improve something that's been concerning me through our  organic conversion is phosphates the measure as farmers we've used for years the phosphate indices  has been declining quite rapidly and i've been sort of quite worried about whether i'd continue  
**[0:29:03-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:03):**  to get good germination rates and hence decent yields from the land stephen breaks uh soil and  water manager for innovation for agriculture the the answer to that really is that the index based  soil analysis methods are really only measuring the phosphate that's in solution and plant  
**[0:29:23-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:23):**  available at any point in time when we are in reality there's a great deal more phosphate  in reserve in the soil which isn't being measured by that methodology but as one improves soil  management through high levels of organic matter and better biological activity that biology in  
**[0:29:43-0:30:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:29:43):**  turn then mineralizes phosphate into available forms for the plant so there's a lot more phosphate  in the soil in the reserve account which we can bring into the current account make available to  plants through better soil management better soil biology current analysis methods with index based  
**[0:30:02-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:02):**  systems to start measuring that the the accepted methodologies for measurement really are just  measuring the amount of nutrients like phosphates that we need to apply to meet crop nutrition  they're not measuring what's in the soil at all reserves are usually far greater i use the analogy  
**[0:30:22-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:22):**  of it's like having a current account where you're making small deposits and quick withdrawals but  also having a big reserve account and it's how do we access that reserve account and bring some of  those long-term reserves of phosphate into an available form and that's really through biology  
**[0:30:41-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:30:41):**  and feeding the biology with soil organic matter is absolutely fundamental so we have to we have  to look at what we're measuring in different ways to fully understand that the all break system of  measurement is is looking at the balances of magnesium calcium phosphate calcium and trying  
**[0:31:01-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:01):**  to establish balances or ratios between those to try and balance the soil mineralogy to make it  have the potential to perform in the best way possible and so what the all break system is  doing is looking not only at the plant available forms but the reserve forms of minerals phosphate  
**[0:31:24-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:24):**  magnesium calcium etc so trying to understand those reserve levels and what we can do to try  and unlock those the other the other sort of third level to that is starting to look at biological  assessments of biology in terms of fungi bacteria mycorrhizae nematodes and microbiology and trying  
**[0:31:47-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:31:47):**  to look at how we can feed that biology to make it work for us so that we can become  subterranean livestock farmers you know you live and learn i could see the indices going down on  on the test and the measures we took um but our crop yield and crop health is actually has been  
**[0:32:02-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:02):**  increasing for the last seven years as we've got further into the organic conversion so that is  it's a great indicator that we we are achieving what we set out to achieve improvement in soil  health um and an aside to that the the sort of biodiversity the natural habitat and the um the  
**[0:32:20-0:32:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:20):**  bugs and the beasts that live around our farm have increased tremendously and hence um farmland birds  who knew that soil tests don't really tell you what's in the soil i was like totally  flabbergasted by that insight and i just found it kind of very disconcerting that these long-term  
**[0:32:41-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:41):**  norms continue to define how we perceive things and and it was one way that kind of conventional  agriculture still had a hold on our understanding of soil to me i had always understood soil tests  as being scientifically correct but actually you know even though richard knew he was regenerating  
**[0:32:59-0:33:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:32:59):**  his soil the science was saying otherwise for me this was crazy because like even on our farm in  chile you know everyone keeps saying oh you should do soil tests and you should test all parts of your  soil to see what you need to put here and there and my dad has always been like well the tests  
**[0:33:17-0:33:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:17):**  aren't that helpful like they weren't helping him figure things out you know a big part of it  is like listening you know it's it's like watching and listening to the land isn't it and seeing how  crops respond and i think you can tell almost as much from that as from you know the different mpk  
**[0:33:33-0:33:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:33):**  levels or something like that which is obviously the kind of the conventional way of testing soil  so it's a lot more to it it's just really important that as this regenerative agriculture  practice develops that we alongside it have the science develop with it because otherwise you can  
**[0:33:52-0:34:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:33:52):**  just see that these principles will hold us back for now bye thank you to every one of you for  listening something all of you can do to help is write us a review on itunes because it's really  good at getting us noticed in any way you can share the show with your farmer friends is of  
**[0:34:21-0:34:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/13-farmerama#t=0:34:21):**  course appreciated we're also really keen to hear what you enjoy and what you don't and what we can  do to make this program useful and enjoyable for you and we'll be back next month hopefully with  all this together in the same place you

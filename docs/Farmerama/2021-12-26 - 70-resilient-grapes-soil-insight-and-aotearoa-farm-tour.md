**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:23):**  This month we hear about more resilient grape varieties and growing grapes in the UK. We're  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:28):**  offered a mind-bending new way of understanding what soil is. And you can sit back and relax  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:34):**  as we take you on a farm tour on the other side of the world.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:41):**  Firstly, here's Victoria Vine Lizard, who's recently established a new vineyard, the Shiny  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:50):**  Vine, on her family's farm in Warwickshire. Victoria's looking to farm her vines as ecologically  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:00:56):**  as possible. And as part of that, she's planted disease-resistant grape varieties which are  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:01):**  more suited to the climate in the UK, known as Pee Wee varieties.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:06):**  So we only just planted in May this year, so we're at very, very early stages. In terms  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:13):**  of the estate, it's always been in the family. So this is my home estate that I've lived  
**[0:01:18-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:18):**  on my entire life, my dad before me. And we've always had land that we've farmed, mainly  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:26):**  it used to be maize and rapeseed. There was a stint that we had peas as well. So I've  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:32):**  simply just taken a proportion of the land and instead I've decided to diversify the  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:39):**  land and the estate into vine growth, grape growing and wine production because that's  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:45):**  a personal interest of mine.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:47):**  I suppose it's a natural progression from me having an interest in where my food comes  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:52):**  from and having a personal interest in growing vegetables and trying to be as low intervention  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:01:59):**  as possible, particularly in this day and age where there's a level of loss of control  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:05):**  in that respect. For some people it can simply be convenience, for others it can be expensive  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:12):**  to eat well.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:14):**  It made sense to me that if I have a passion in wine and wine making that I should also  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:20):**  have a hand in how those grapes have been grown, how the vines have been nurtured to  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:26):**  also see if I can be as responsible as possible for the land itself, to not abuse it, to not  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:32):**  overwork it, so to speak. That's a common farmer's term, overworking it, but to look  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:40):**  after the soils because ultimately it's going to be there after me. I haven't used up all  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:45):**  of our land, it's a relatively speaking for farming, it's a small estate, it's 150 acres  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:02:52):**  and there's two lakes, extensive woodland, beautiful mature trees, the biodiversity is  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:00):**  fantastic, we've got all kinds of birds here and species that we're proud of.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:08):**  Grape growing also is my way of having a hand in how the land is looked after, how it's  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:14):**  going to progress. I suppose I'd like to create an environment where also people can come  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:20):**  and find a bit of peace in nature and to learn about how grapes are grown and where our vegetables  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:25):**  come from and take a moment to look around them, to walk around the lake and to take  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:31):**  walks through the woodlands and to listen to the birds, as cliche as that sounds, but  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:37):**  professionally speaking I came from a very corporate commercialised environment and I  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:41):**  spent a huge chunk of my time where I recognised it's very difficult to know when to stop and  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:50):**  know when to be able to switch off and nature does that for me, so I want to create a space  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:55):**  where I can share that with other people as well.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:03:58):**  From the outset I've tried to make it as easier as possible, if there's such a thing, by picking  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:06):**  grape varieties that I've heard anyway and it appears that science is telling us are  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:14):**  lower intervention, so I'm talking about the Pee Wee grape varieties that have been effectively  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:20):**  bred and selected to have a high resistance to fungal diseases. So the idea is that you  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:28):**  won't need to do as many passes in the vineyard with your tractor, you're not compacting the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:32):**  soils as much, you're obviously not having to use as many fungicides. I don't think they  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:39):**  are perfect in the sense of I don't believe there are varieties that you never need to  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:44):**  spray but it certainly makes it a lot easier. I heard somebody else say it's all very well  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:49):**  saying you want to be sustainable but you're not sustainable if you're economically not  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:04:54):**  viable as well, if you're not having a sustainable business, so it's finding that balance, that  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:00):**  absolute respect for the land and for what you're doing and making as wiser decisions  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:06):**  as possible. It's all meaningless if you end up with a business that cripples you because  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:12):**  you never actually end up with any fruit or be able to make any wines that anybody wants  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:17):**  to drink, which is another concern that people have had with Pee Wee varieties thus far.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:25):**  Decades ago they weren't necessarily known as creating great wines whereas now with a  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:29):**  bit of trial and error and extensive use in countries like Germany we're finding that  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:35):**  there's some varieties that are making some delicious wines and I think the market's picking  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:40):**  up on that. It's about marketing it right as well which I'm hoping as time goes on will  
**[0:05:46-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:46):**  become easier. The challenges that always face people of colour, that's not something  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:05:56):**  that I haven't experienced, I'm aware of, I couldn't say that it's limited to me, I've  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:04):**  been aware of the fact that I've always felt I've had to work twice as hard as others but  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:09):**  if you've been doing that from the day you've taken a breath I suppose you don't know any  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:14):**  different. What it has made me is very aware of the importance of inclusivity and diversity  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:21):**  in the business that I'm about to run. So I want to make sure that any wine I produce,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:27):**  any labelling, any marketing, any website that I do, any social media, every single  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:32):**  time I open my mouth that to the best of my abilities I don't feel that anybody from any  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:38):**  background, religion, race, creed, whatever, I don't want them to feel they can't be a  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:46):**  part of what I'm doing. That's important to me so it has moulded me in that respect. I  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:52):**  would say I have a good collection of stories and I'm aware of the importance of making  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:06:59):**  sure that nobody, whatever their personal story is, ever feels that they can't be part  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:04):**  of mine. You know so long as it's all good feelings obviously, you know, but that's important  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:10):**  to me. But everything that I do it's important to me that it's a space that people can connect,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:18):**  people can you know find a bit of peace, people can feel seen, people can you know share their  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:23):**  stories and not feel that they're excluded from mine or my business because their story  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:30):**  differs from mine. You know that's the core of everything that I do, that's the core of  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:35):**  what the shiny vine itself is and the imagery of it. It's a vine that's struggled, it's  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:43):**  slightly gnarled, it's got all these knots and ridges in it but it's shining because  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:48):**  of its own experience, its own ability to overcome and to produce fruit, fruit being  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:55):**  the good things that we can share with other people. So that's why I'm called, that's why  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:07:59):**  the business is called the shiny vine and it's the root of everything that I do. I'm  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:05):**  hoping that our industry becomes ever increasingly open-minded and that means the kinds of people  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:12):**  that we invite into the industry, that means creating spaces where younger people can come  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:19):**  into the agricultural industry and it's not about just landowners, people who perhaps  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:25):**  come from a fortunate position. I think we need to, I suppose I'm boiling back to what  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:30):**  I said previously, that being as inclusive as possible and it also means giving different  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:35):**  grape varieties an opportunity and so long as the product is good, which obviously is  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:40):**  important, so long as the wine is something that can truly be marketed for, I hope this  
**[0:08:46-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:46):**  industry opens its mind a little bit more to differences.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:08:56):**  Research scientist Andy Neill shares the results of some of the work he's involved in at Rothamsted  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:01):**  Research where they've established a very different way of thinking about soil. Andy  
**[0:09:07-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:07):**  says that soil is a composite extended phenotype of the microbes that make up that soil. This  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:16):**  is definitely one to re-listen to a few times to really get your head around it.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:23):**  The extended composite phenotype is based upon the concept originally of Richard Dawkins  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:29):**  of the extended phenotype and he demonstrated that with certain organisms, birds are a very  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:36):**  good example, that the genes, or rather the effect of the genes can be noticed beyond  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:43):**  the boundaries of the body. So a bird's nest is a perfect example of that because they're  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:49):**  clearly an expression of the organism's genes because you can tell one species from another  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:54):**  just by looking at the nest. Even if the bird isn't there, you can definitely tell a hummingbird's  
**[0:09:59-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:09:59):**  nest from an osprey's nest or a bowerbird's nest from an ostrich's nest. But critically,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:07):**  evolution works upon those nests. So if those nests do not protect the eggs well, the genes  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:12):**  are not passed on to the next generation. So there's this close coupling between the  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:17):**  expression of those genes in building the nest, but then the selection of birds that  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:23):**  are good at building nests back onto the evolution of those genes. So that's the sort of concept  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:30):**  of an extended phenotype. What we've done is taken that and used the extended composite  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:36):**  phenotype to describe that process. So to understand soil as the expression of the genes of all  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:44):**  the organisms in it, and that's where we add the extended term in the sense that the microbiology  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:50):**  and the genes that are being expressed there are what are creating this living structure  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:10:56):**  that is soil. Now, critically, what drives this extended composite phenotype is the input  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:02):**  of carbon as energy and nutrients for the microbes. But then once it's processed, so  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:09):**  you put carbon into soil as leafy material, as sticks, as effectively large, complex organic  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:15):**  material, it's broken down by the microbial community in soil. And when those cells die  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:21):**  and burst open and release all their innards, when they secrete compounds out through the  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:28):**  cell wall, that carbon is then of the right molecular size to stick to clay particles  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:34):**  in soil, and it forms a sort of cement that then starts to glue particles together in  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:40):**  ever greater sizes. And that's what creates the structure that we call good structure  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:45):**  in soil. The critical bit about the extended composite phenotype concept is that that structure  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:11:55):**  that is created by the activity of microbes breaking down carbon-creating structure is  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:00):**  that that structure then feeds back upon how the microbes live by changing the way in which  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:07):**  nutrients, water, and oxygen flow through the system. So there's this complex feedback  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:13):**  between the way microbes create structure and the way that that new structure then feeds  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:19):**  back upon the genes in the microbes. We haven't had an opportunity to really look at very  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:24):**  fine time scales. We know soil structure itself and soil carbon sequestration is quite a slow  
**[0:12:31-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:31):**  process. So we have looked at some very degraded soils, soils that have been starved of carbon  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:41):**  for over 50 years. Very low pores, very few connections between those pores. When we plant  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:48):**  that up as a pasture and manage it as a permanent pasture system, even after 10 years, we're  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:12:54):**  still struggling to see statistically significant changes in the pore network and the amount  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:00):**  of pores in those soils. So it's very, I'm not saying all soils will be that slow. I'm  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:05):**  sure some soils will be even slower. But our experience is that you've got to think about  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:10):**  these things on a sort of decade time scale. How the microbial community changes, we've  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:15):**  never really looked at in any great depth. So one of the key questions is if you take  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:21):**  an organism that has been grown in the lab for 10 years and has got used to being grown  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:26):**  in the lab, how effective is it going to be when you place it back in a community that  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:30):**  may have tens of thousands of other species competing for nutrients in those soils? So  
**[0:13:36-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:36):**  theoretically those organisms are not going to be fit to be able to thrive in any soil.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:45):**  Given that soil is very low in nutrients, it's a very changeable environment, it can  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:50):**  be very hot during some seasons, very cold in others, very high salt content, but then  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:55):**  there can also be very low water content. So organisms to be able to thrive have to  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:13:59):**  be as good at coping with those changes as the resident community is. If it's lived for  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:06):**  10 years in the lab, it will have become a labrador rather than a wolf. And so it's very  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:11):**  difficult to get it to, now what we can say is the soils we have at Rothamsted that have  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:16):**  had farmyard manure for 170 years, we're not seeing a particularly different microbial  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:23):**  community in those. They look ostensibly the same. So it's not like you're suddenly seeing  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:28):**  soil, this is really helpful, isn't it? It's not like you're seeing soil suddenly looking  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:33):**  like the rumen microbiome of cattle because it's got lots of farmyard manure in it. It  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:39):**  still looks like the soil microbiome. So I'm rather skeptical about individual organisms  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:47):**  being the answer. I think the way to manage soil is to accept that it functions as a community  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:14:56):**  and try and manage that community. And that's actually quite optimistic because we have  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:15:00):**  evidence that we can do that, that we can influence the way the whole community functions  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:15:06):**  and we can manage it in a positive direction so that it uses nitrogen more efficiently,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:15:12):**  it uses less anaerobic processes. So we know that this is possible. A lot of these single  
**[0:15:19-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:15:19):**  organism products, I am rather skeptical of.

**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:01):**  local market is doing as well because it sets the benchmark and we have been fortunate that  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:07):**  we have got these partnerships with butcher shops which have locked us into a price so  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:13):**  we do have that surety but you know if things get too out of whack then we'd have to adjust  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:19):**  our prices to fall back and so we're two different to what the market is doing.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:26):**  At least we do have something that's green.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:31):**  How much winter feed would you make here?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:39):**  Do you make...  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:40):**  Nothing.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:41):**  That's what I thought.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:42):**  I had a thing with it.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:43):**  Okay.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:44):**  The whole drive has really been around getting fossil fuels out of our food system and so  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:19:52):**  we don't make hay or silage and that's probably the big change that we've made is that we're  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:00):**  not afraid to let the grass grow long in the summertime as long as we at some stage we  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:05):**  always will catch up with it and just with big mobs of cattle densely stocked come back  
**[0:20:12-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:12):**  and so they're grazing and are shifted every day so we're returning a lot of that dry matter  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:21):**  back onto the soil surface where it gets broken down by healthy soil biology.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:28):**  So is that part of your planning?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah so that's part of the New Zealand Environment Trust planning and the plan was to go right  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:37):**  to the top of the hill but we started in 2008 and of course after the 2008 financial crisis  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:44):**  the money just didn't flow into the trust and so we got our budget which we were allocated  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:49):**  for three years and then they said sorry there's no more so we didn't get to go right to the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:53):**  top of that hill.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:54):**  Are you measuring the organic matter in your soils?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:20:58):**  Because I just look around and I mean this is all going to go back into the soil as organic  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:03):**  matter a lot of this dead grass and I mean okay you've got a low stocking rate here so  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:10):**  you've got heaps of.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:12):**  That's just for now.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:13):**  I know it's not the normal one but it would just be interesting to see what the long-term  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:17):**  effects of this organic matter going back into the soil.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:21):**  Okay you're having a difficult year this year but maybe the long term is going to have some  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:26):**  significant effects further down the track of water holding capacity and those sorts  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:32):**  of things.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:33):**  That's my expectation.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:34):**  Mmm that's brilliant.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:35):**  Saw lots of chicory coming up in the paddocks down by where the hens are.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:42):**  Yeah yeah we planted a lot of that.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:44):**  We haven't planted or cultivated for 12 more years since we've sort of been in this mindset.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:21:55):**  And like this here we had a mob of like little calves that we couldn't push and they were  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:02):**  being densely stocked.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:03):**  So you know we'd get a bigger mob of cattle in here that we'll graze and there's still  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:08):**  lots of good clover and lots of good grazing in here and they'll do a good job of tramping  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:14):**  all the rest of it.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:15):**  There's some plankton in there as well.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:16):**  Yeah it would be just a wild native plankton.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:17):**  Yeah but I mean still it's a.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:18):**  It's diversity.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:19):**  Diversity and it's providing a different nutrient level too isn't it.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:24):**  Yep absolutely yeah and other minerals and that for the livestock.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:29):**  That's right.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:30):**  So can you walk, you actually go on a walk from like.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah I didn't point it out but back at the sheep yards there is because part of the agreement  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:41):**  for New Zealand is that the farms open to the public and so people can see where their  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:46):**  money that they donated to the trust has gone.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:49):**  And so they sign in and read the health and safety briefing at the front of the farm and  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:22:55):**  then drive into the sheep yards, sheep and shed area and then there's maps and that that  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:01):**  show them how to walk and there's little signs.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:03):**  Oh okay so those are the signs that you get.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:06):**  Yep yep.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:08):**  You're right.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:09):**  With this taller grazing and more trees and then having public access to the farm and  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:16):**  fire is a bit of a concern.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:21):**  So what soils are these mainly?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:22):**  Great soil that I'm trying to work with.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:27):**  Well they're a silt, if I show you over the back there it's quite interesting, is a waterfall  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:35):**  and it's like papa which is you know it's sea sediment which is laid down underneath  
**[0:23:41-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:41):**  the sea just stacked up on top of that and then it's just the source of development under  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:50):**  the forest and washed off the hills around.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:54):**  Amazing.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:23:55):**  Do you want the skate open?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:02):**  Yeah we might have to walk from here.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:03):**  Yeah that's right.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:04):**  I usually drive and then we all go.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:05):**  Yeah can you, I left you in front of the hole there.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:10):**  I'm still here.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:11):**  As I'm getting a guy to remake the map.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:35):**  It's been a long year and we don't know about you but here at the Fomarama team we're pretty  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/69-resilient-grapes-soil-insight-and-aotearoa-farm-tour#t=0:24:40):**  exhausted.

This month we begin on the island of Jersey, where the community have come together to  build sustainable supply networks, benefiting both smaller scale farmers and local people.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:17):**  We revisit rewilding and how it fits into the farming landscape.  Then it's back to a regenerative farm to hear how they are working with nature to build  pollinators and many other beneficials into their farming landscape.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:31):**  Finally, we hear from a Malawian reverend about the connections between their faith,  farming and agro-ecological principles.  The Sustainable Cooperative, or SCOOP, in Jersey aim to create a more sustainable supply  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:50):**  of food on the island.  They have a plastic free shop where both those buying food and those supplying it are members.  Co-founder India Hamilton wanted to make sure that ecological farmers had a clear route  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:01):**  to market and that people had access to more affordable, healthy local food.  It's a co-operative of conscientious consumers, people in Jersey who really care about the  environment and they've come together to support the small organic farmer.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:21):**  I got back to Jersey and I was reading around the subject, there was loads of different  stuff going on around pollutants and water, really progressive research and big companies,  big sort of supermarkets coming in and taking over local businesses.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:43):**  But I noticed one statistic which didn't quite work out, which was organic farming had dropped  by 80% in five years and I knew that organic farming globally was on the up and from a  supply and demand level I knew that something was more complicated and something different  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:01):**  was going on.  So we went to find out what it was.  I was very lucky to come across this lady called Laura Santa Maria who looks at regenerative  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:12):**  system design and she helped me understand across multi-stakeholders within the community  how you kind of ask questions to align an agenda in a way.  And so we did a bit of that and asked kind of targeted questions around problems and  
**[0:02:34-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:34):**  we realised that almost every level, if it's a local only campaign or how regularly restaurants  print menus or the size of a wholesaler, each element were marginalising the smaller farmer.  It was a little bit of serendipity because at the same time I met a couple called Casper  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:57):**  and Susanna Wimbley and they had started an agricultural art project there where they  had invited artists from around the world to come in and interpret artistically the  agriculture locally demanding a sort of grassroots understanding.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:15):**  And so they were sort of gathering understanding from the community.  I had come from this sort of food systems solutions background, kind of chefing background  and I'd met a few farmers like Justin from Amble Farm and we all sort of got together  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:34):**  at one point and we decided to, we can't ask the farmers to do anything if there isn't  a shop and if there's a shop and a market, let's get going on this.  So we just went for it and crowdfunded this idea of sort of aggregating the market to  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:53):**  support those farmers.  Well we're all a bit last minute, so the day before getting it going we were up all  night, we had not only crowded the money but also the people to do it.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:07):**  Nothing was bought in terms of the shop's infrastructure, it was all upcycled material  from pallet boards but Casper who designed the shop has got a very high standard.  So we were sanding and using V Polish wax and getting it to an incredibly almost ridiculous  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:26):**  high spec.  We sort of set a standard of quality, about 120 people came and we were pretty entrenched  in stress and tears.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:37):**  But going forward from that we learnt really quickly that when you're working with food  you're basically working with things that are dying and you have to be good at it and  you have to have a good cycle and you have to work very closely with your suppliers.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:53):**  We'd launched with 350 different products and none of us had really done this before.  And so it's been a really steep learning curve and we have now about just shy of 500  products.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:08):**  We're completely plastic free or single use free and it's been very interesting to watch  people really slow down.  I mean our till system makes you really slow down.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:20):**  We have about six or seven very committed volunteers and some amazing staff to keep  it going.  It's nice.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:33):**  When you remove all the packaging people call it bulk buying but actually it's precision  buying and it means you've got this, you've all of a sudden got this cost management to  organic food that people who are low income can afford because they're all of a sudden  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:49):**  buying five peas worth of something for a meal so they can price their organic food  in.  So sometimes in our queue we'll have someone who's driven in a really fancy car with kids  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:01):**  from private school and then a few people who are on low income and they all pay a sliding  scale of membership and everyone equally gets 25% off or you're a non-member and then you  just pay the full whack.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:17):**  Casper and Susanna had lived in Germany and it was a membership model that they had seen  work in terms of monthly payments.  We had noticed that a lot of farm shops locally had suffered or disappeared when supermarkets  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:33):**  came in and we wanted to create a model where if people wanted that convenience and that  choice of supermarkets they could go that day and it not affect us so we wanted to be  pre-paid and cover our basic bills and our staffing.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:47):**  We don't co-op the farmers, we want to pay what they ask for and we want them to sell  to any market.  We want to take their surplus, we want to kind of be as easy for them as possible.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:59):**  Some farmers are really jowling with us, other farmers are kind of too big and then support  us when we need it.  I think in a couple of years time when they're getting more and more confident to grow and  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:14):**  extend the season and actually probably grow less potatoes.  Jersey's got a very strong potato land use directive which impacts our biodiversity.  But what's really fun is we've got a couple of really small farmers who have huge diversity  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:32):**  and they'll just come in and drop off a kilo of a yacon or akaroo or something crazy or  quinoa or amaranth and they're so excited but we will sell it.  Co-ops are really interesting to run.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:48):**  People put a lot of time into them.  I suppose this is kind of a learning curve and if someone integral makes you turn on  it, it's actually how you value that effort putting in.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:08:00):**  There's no financial effort so it makes it quite fragile.  There's no financial accounting for that kind of effort of people.  What's been important to us is we've affiliated with different platforms that are looking  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:08:19):**  at how you value different economies.  We joined a platform called Good Market Global which is based out of Sri Lanka which looks  at the economy and the value of a sustainable model and it takes you all through the employment  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:08:36):**  and the security of volunteers and that sort of stuff.  Biodiversity is incredibly exciting for a chef and most people will struggle to access  that biodiversity in their daily life.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:08:53):**  So if you're a small farmer, go and find a chef or someone who understands how to manage  that biodiversity and make it really palatable for people.  Farming is a one part, it's responsible they say for 25 cent of carbon emission but it's  
**[0:09:12-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:09:12):**  one of the only acts that everybody can integrate with nature with and through and farming can  do anything from enhance life to destroy life.  I sit and I think about these beautiful places that find it so difficult to get to market  
**[0:09:37-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:09:37):**  and if everywhere farmed like those places would, it'll be fine.  Last month you heard a wonderful journey through the thistles, butterflies, anthills as Isabella  Tree described some of the most surprising moments in the last 20 years of letting the  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:10:00):**  wilderness return at Nepp Estate.  As farmers we're always a little wary of the idea of rewilding because farming is so often  pitted as the opposite of rewilding.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:10:14):**  So we quizzed Isabella about this to get the lowdown on whether she sees herself as a farmer  and how projects like Nepp fit into the farming landscape.  We cannot continue farming intensively as we are, it's unsustainable, there is no future  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:10:32):**  in it, it is a dying system whether we like it or not.  The future is regenerative farming and so we have to be doing that on all our intensive  agricultural land and that in itself is more wildlife friendly.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:10:48):**  Farming can be the webbing between those regenerated farm areas where we're producing our food,  where we have really proper dynamic habitat for wildlife.  Why should people living in an arable belt be deprived of any life at all?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:11:04):**  We need life, we need wildlife, we need wild spaces, we know the dangers of severing ourselves  from nature.  We've only been urban for a blip in our evolution anyway, if we disconnect ourselves entirely  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:11:17):**  from nature we know that has a mental and a physical impact.  The NHS can even put figures on it.  So we need access to nature, we need access not just to green spaces because we know those  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:11:29):**  can be deserts, we need access to nature that is heaving, thrumming, buzzing with life and  if we can have that on our agricultural land as well then we're win-win.  Rewilding has shown that we can, just in 20 years we've proved at Nepp that our soils  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:11:44):**  have restored significantly, so we've doubled our carbon, we have tripled the mycorrhizal  fungi networks underground, we have tripled our soil biota.  That is really astonishing in under 20 years.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:11:59):**  So what one could consider is using rewilding in a system alongside agriculture, so to restore  your soils.  So a bit like the rotational systems of the past where you allowed land to lie fallow  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:12:13):**  and be grazed, go back to pasture in order to allow those soils to recover.  What you could do, say in the fens for example where we know there's only about 15 harvests  left before we've got no topsoil at all, you could do a rewilding project on say 3, 4,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:12:28):**  5,000 acres for just a generation, so for 25, 35 years.  Allow your species to come back, allow your soils to restore, allow your water to purify,  or doing all your other ecosystem services, and then at the end of that time you send  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:12:44):**  in those amazing machines that the Forestry Commission have, turn that whole load of thorny  scrub back into a workable tilth, very easy to do with these machines, and turn that area  into regenerative farming.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:12:57):**  Meanwhile around you, areas are starting to come up to rewild, so you've got your thorny  scrub coming up again, and that is where your turtle doves, your nightingales, your purple  emperors go to, that's the next door habitat that they can move to.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:13:10):**  So you can do this on a cyclical basis, but just on a much longer time frame and a much  larger area.  It would be a really interesting way I think of seeing rewilding and regenerative farming  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:13:23):**  working in tandem.  There's this wonderful feeling at the moment, and it's just happened in the last year or  so where everyone who owns even a tiny patch of land wants to do their bit, and absolutely  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:13:34):**  there's things to do.  I think the first key is connectivity.  It goes down into very even small scale.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:13:41):**  I've got a friend who has rewilded his back garden in Bristol, but what he's done is he's  talked to his neighbours.  So the neighbours have now all put in hedgehog tunnels in their fences and their hedgerows  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:13:55):**  so that all the gardens are now connected by the tunnel, so they've now become a wildlife  corridor.  One person has a pond, another person has quite happily got nettles in the bottom of  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:14:06):**  their garden, so between them in this street they have pretty much every habitat that you'd  want but it is now connected.  And if you can connect a street with say a railway line, railway embankments or perhaps  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:14:19):**  just a park at one end, suddenly you're connecting nature together in a really interesting and  dynamic way.  There's obvious things you can do in your garden like not using chemicals at all, going  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:14:28):**  chemical free.  Instantly you have interest for insects and for birds.  But I think from our point of view when we're talking about getting natural processes back  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:14:38):**  into a landscape, it still does really depend on scale.  That's when you get the most excitement, the most unexpected responses and that's when  you start getting your turtle doves or your nightingales, your really rare species then  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:14:54):**  have a chance if they're in these big landscapes with dynamic natural habitat.  So what we're seeing now more and more is farmers with say 100, 200 acres clubbing together  with people around them creating farm clusters and this is a wonderful new phenomenon.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:15:12):**  I think Defra has on their desk at the moment eight farm clusters to do kind of rewilding  projects like this.  Rewilding Britain has just announced an amazing project from the top of Pumlemann Mountain  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:15:25):**  to the benthic layer of Cardigan Bay so that will be a huge rewilding project using natural  processes that will link all sorts of stakeholders together.  So you'll have forestry commission land, you've got Welsh National Government land, you've  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:15:41):**  got Royal land, you've got small holders, you've got gardeners.  It'll be everybody in that catchment will be involved in some way.  So it really is about connecting and joining the dots I think.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:15:54):**  The wonderful thing about rewilding is it never ends and so because we're not kind of,  we have no goals, no set targets, we just wait and see what happens and every week something  extraordinary turns up.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:16:06):**  We had a fly species new to Britain last week which was all the excitement but we've also  just applied for our beaver licence and we would love to have beavers at NET that would  just be astonishing.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:16:20):**  They create amazing habitat.  If we could get money for a land bridge over the A24 we could join with some other landowners  and perhaps one day reach the sea.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:16:30):**  We'd love to rewild the whole of the River Aida catchment and have our cattle browsing  on Sallow on NET one week and then eating seaweed on Shoreham Beach the next.  I think I would like to share a feeling of hope really because I think for us in the  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:16:49):**  last year we have certainly felt that the tide is turning and that people are now open  to new ideas, hungry for new ideas.  For me I feel like regenerative farming and rewilding is inevitable.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:17:03):**  It's going to happen because it has to happen.  The problem is we have these dinosaur kind of corporate structures that are the food  and farming industry who want to hold things back.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:17:15):**  They have vested interests in maintaining the status quo and it's how do we dismantle  that as fast as possible so that we can be free to do this really responsible regenerative  ecology and farming that will save us and the planet.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:17:35):**  Following on from Isabella's vision of a patchwork of regenerative farms we wanted to return  to Gothenley Farm in Somerset to hear how Fred Price is building wildlife into the arteries  and veins of his farm.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:17:49):**  We were particularly intrigued by his plans to have every part of the farm no more than  50 metres away from beneficial habitants.  So behind me is an 8 acre field of our Autumn Heritage varieties.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:07):**  Autumn Heritage not as some sort of gimmick but I see them as low input cereals.  So we spend a lot of time sourcing different products from gene banks, multiplying them  up over 3 or 4 years before we grow them out on big acreage and get other farmers to grow  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:21):**  them for us as well.  So that's behind me, different stages of development, different sized blocks.  As we get to the end of the field we've got, we just had about 3 quarters of an acre left  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:32):**  over so I went back to the grain store and chucked all the seeds that I had left over  from cover crops and herbal lays and cereals and pulses, put them in the drill and just  drilled it and actually now we're stood here in, when is it, end of May and it looks absolutely  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:51):**  fantastic.  Absolutely humming when you walk through.  It's a really visceral experience actually isn't it?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:57):**  Very addictive way of farming when you start.  And then there's sort of basically a, we call it a brook, that runs right through the middle  of the farm, I guess like a kind of artery and the way I see the farm moving forward  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:11):**  would be that being kind of like, almost like imagine a delta, what a delta looks like and  then from this brook which is the kind of permanent refuge area for all the beneficials,  arteries and veins run from this throughout into the fields each side either in the form  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:31):**  of like buffer strips against the brook but then dividing some fields up using hedgerows  and then some of the larger fields kind of agroforestry so you've got arteries running  from the mainstream.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:47):**  So I guess like a leaf or a delta, that kind of image.  The whole theory being that to build resilience into your system you have to have some permanent  areas of high biological diversity, I guess nature and on our farm at the moment those  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:08):**  pockets aren't linked and they're not close enough together so I see a farm in the future  where you're never more than 50 meters away from one of those pockets so that if you have  a block of arable crop all the beneficials that you've built up in these permanent areas  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:25):**  have access to that area which you're kind of drawing down on the fertility or the good  work that you're doing but without drawing down on the biodiversity.  So that's kind of how I see the farm and I see the brook where we stood now is a real  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:39):**  like kind of source for all of those tributaries to go out into the more kind of commercial  arable cropping, that's how I would see it.  Can you just tell me a little bit about the 50 meter theory and for example maybe talk  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:56):**  about it in the context of that bean field that we can see?  Yeah so most of the things I've come across, in fact all of the things, none of them are  my ideas but I've applied them when I've seen first hand something going wrong.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:12):**  So my whole understanding of soil fertility changed when I had a whole half the farm go  flat, the cereals weren't flat because the nutrient resource efficiency of the cereals  was greater than I anticipated year on year and so it made me really think about what  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:27):**  was going on under the soil.  Similarly I've had an experience this year where I've got 18 acres of spring beans that  we use as part of the pig diet and as along with our no fungicide no nitrogen policy we  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:41):**  also have a no insecticide policy.  So about three weeks after the beans emerged they were experiencing notching on the leaves  so that's basically pea and bean weevil pest.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:55):**  Now I could have just gone out with a sprayer and sprayed it and sorted the problem but  I've lost probably a third of the field but when you look at the field it's just remarkable,  it's actually quite a long thin field, it's mostly headland but genuinely a strip through  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:09):**  the middle of the field, i.e. the furthest point from any of the hedgerows and permanent  refuge areas is the bit that's been hammered and affected.  I mean typically your headlands are your worst parts of your field with compaction and where  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:21):**  you're turning and that kind of thing and so it's an absolute visual example of where  we're trying to get to.  If we can make every part of the farm easily accessible because I think something I've  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:32):**  heard and read is these beneficials can migrate 50 meters from wherever they are based and  so that field is a perfect example.  I'm not saying the beans on the outside haven't been affected but in terms of the impact on  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:45):**  yield instead of 50-60% it's probably 10 or 15%.  I think that's the whole model that we're moving to, much more accepting lower yields  but at no cost and those yields are always the same amount lower.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:02):**  So 15 or 10% lower rather than the kind of boom or bust swings that we see at the moment.  So I guess I just have to accept that field how it looks at the moment and take a 10 year  view and say back myself that we won't be getting that in 10 years time.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:16):**  But it's tough at the moment because we're neither organic nor conventional, we're somewhere  in between, we've created red lines for ourselves because I want to find out and push the system  as far as it can go and you do suffer because you can't just resort to the chemical can  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:31):**  because it sets you back to where you started.  Finally we have another report from Jonny Hanson at Jubilee Farm in conversation with  the Reverend Goodwin's Mayor about his work with the farming community in Malawi and how  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:44):**  their faith connects with their farming practices.  We're back at Jubilee Farm this month and although we're a small farm based in Northern  Ireland we like to think locally, we like to use our farm and what we're doing here  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:59):**  to engage with people who are doing similar projects around the world.  I'm joined by the Reverend Goodwin's Mayor and we've just finished running an event here  near Jubilee Farm called the Reverend Farmer because Goodwin's is not just a Presbyterian  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:14):**  Minister but he is also a trainer in conservation agriculture.  Goodwin's would you be able to tell us a little bit about your project in Northern Malawi  and how it combines faith and farming?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:27):**  We are doing a project in the northern part of Malawi in a community called Chirida where  this was the community that has been devastated with hunger for several years.  We looked at that as a problem and upon searching and trying to find the answers we discovered  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:45):**  that the best method that could fit the community was what we call foundations for farming which  is based on four cornerstones that we use for teaching.  The first one is we teach people to be on time all the time because we believe that  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:59):**  when people they know when to do it that means they will have good harvest.  The second cornerstone is they have to do something on a high standard, they have to  just do things because they want just to try but they have to do it specifically on a high  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:15):**  standard that's the recommendation.  The third one, the third point is there should be no wastage, everything that they harvest  the residues must remain in the garden decompose and turn into manure.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:31):**  The last part of it is they have to do the work with joy because we had the experience  that many people in Malawi they were thinking to do farm work was a punishment so they had  no joy but we had to tell them that farming is the way that we are supposed to do and  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:43):**  they have to have joy doing it.  Christians believe that the world was created by God and man was put in the world to take  care of the world therefore there should be a great relationship between Christians and  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:03):**  the creation.  So what we teach our farmers is at the end of their harvest they know that though they  planted maize they needed rain and that rain is provided by God.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:15):**  They had to work on the garden they needed energy and that we believe that it came from  God.  So at the end of the harvest what we do is all the people they come together in a community,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:26):**  we have some gospel artists around our community which we have from another part who is an  ambassador at the moment Maria Nunwe with the choir redemption choir and people come  together to celebrate.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:38):**  The main reason they celebrate is that God gave us a good weather, God gave us good rains  and he gave us good energy and it's time to celebrate and it's time for joy.  So in our local language we call it tiza mwemetera toko vironga.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:54):**  Then after harvesting we have joy.

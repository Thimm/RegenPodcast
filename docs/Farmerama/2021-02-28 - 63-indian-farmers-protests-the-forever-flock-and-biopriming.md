**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:00):**  They're basically saying, we'll stick here till you shoot us dead because if you pass  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:06):**  these laws of total deregulation, we're going to be dead anyway.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:13):**  What happened yesterday was Republic Day of India and a totally orchestrated invasion  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:20):**  of the Red Fort was done.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:22):**  The parade was peaceful.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:23):**  The farmers protest over two months has been totally peaceful.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:27):**  This to me took me back to 84 where exactly in the same way a deflection took place, a  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:34):**  criminalization of farmers took place.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:36):**  30,000 people had died in 84 in that period in Punjab.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:40):**  Right now, for a very peaceful movement to continue to be able to tell its story in authenticity  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:47):**  when now the loaded media is deflecting it, that's the challenge.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:54):**  I think for all of us, that's the challenge.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:03:57):**  Here is this amazing work being done all over, three of us from three continents and sharing  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:04):**  the same vision.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:07):**  Look at them and look at BBC and what they talk about in terms of the future of agriculture.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:15):**  For those who are working on care for the land, harvesting your tomatoes is not a painful  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:23):**  task, but all of the thing is we'll get robots to relieve the farmer of hard work.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:30):**  They've been trying to relieve us of hard work forever till they made everyone jobless.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:36):**  I think that narrative of work as drudgery rather than work as liberation is part of  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:43):**  the new narrative that we must tell.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:46):**  It's so much of a fossil fuel story that it had to define every bit of autonomous work  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:52):**  by people as drudgery and real slave work as progress.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:04:59):**  Now they're reaching the stage with robotics and artificial intelligence.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:02):**  We don't need people.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:03):**  99% of you are useless.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:06):**  So our farmers are seeing the past.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:10):**  They've lived through 30 years of globalization and neoliberal deregulation, and they can  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:16):**  see what the future will be.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:18):**  They know they won't have a place and they don't want to be disposable because they're  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:24):**  proud farmers.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:25):**  They take pride in their work.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:29):**  I think nobody should see the Indian farmers protest as Indian for two reasons.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:35):**  First, every fourth farmer of the world is an Indian because we have fought to stay small  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:41):**  farmers.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:43):**  We fought against the mythology of large farms are productive.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:47):**  We've defended the smallness.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:50):**  We've celebrated smallness.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:52):**  And so every fourth farmer is an Indian, but also whether it was the green revolution in  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:05:57):**  1965 or neoliberal agriculture in 91 or Bill Gates and digital agriculture, India or East  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:05):**  India Company in the beginning.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:07):**  India for some reason has always been with experiment of greed in a new colonization  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:13):**  always comes.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:14):**  I think it's because the land is so generous.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:17):**  People are so hardworking that we are a very big economy, just that it's not counted.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:24):**  So the Indian farmers protest are really global protests and it's about small farmers.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:29):**  It's a small farmer future.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:31):**  The farmers are defending.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:33):**  And it is about continuing the fight against the East India Company that captured Africans  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:40):**  to work as slaves on land grab from the indigenous people.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:44):**  That empire of cotton is today the empire of bad food.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:50):**  And all of the struggles are one.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:52):**  And I think our duty is to not allow the story of the Indian farmers protest to be catalyzed  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:06:59):**  and to build it and link it to our stories wherever we are, because it is relevant.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:06):**  You know, you've got such an important extinction rebellion going on.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:10):**  I think the threat of extinction of the small farmer is the foundation of all other extinctions  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:17):**  because only the small farmer who has the possibility and potential to care, not just  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:22):**  for the land, but all the species that depend on the land.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:25):**  So if all those other movements can wake up to this, until we cannot allow the extinction  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:32):**  of the small farmer, we need the opposite.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:34):**  We need everyone to be a farmer directly or indirectly, you know, and to really have more  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:40):**  people on the land.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:41):**  You know, we need 50, according to me, we need 50% directly taking care of the land  
**[0:07:46-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:07:46):**  and the rest supported and supporting the 50%.

**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:08:41):**  And I was farming that with my best friend, and we were pushing the realms really of regenerative  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:08:48):**  farming in the UK.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:08:50):**  We were very much trying to base ourselves as part of the ecology on our farm.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:08:57):**  The challenge we had taken on with Village Farm was taking this very denuded coastal  
**[0:09:02-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:02):**  arable farm and turning it into a wildlife haven, producing beautiful food that was increasing

**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:12):**  And the nuts and bolts of it all, and the very sadness of it all, Tim was killed in

**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:21):**  And the fallout of this was that we lost staff, very quickly turned this business that was  
**[0:09:29-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:29):**  something that I look forward to every day getting up to do into a deeply sad, very emotional  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:40):**  job where my heart was broken.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:45):**  Long story short, I got back to my family farm and my family gave me a small part of  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:52):**  the farm to run.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:54):**  And I tried to take back as many animals as I possibly could.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:09:58):**  And I got the rest of them to as best of homes as I possibly could, because that was really  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:02):**  important to me.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:05):**  And I had an awful year.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:07):**  And the one thing that kept me going every day was getting up and seeing these sheep  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:11):**  and moving them and caring for them.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:13):**  And they got me through this horrible time.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:17):**  And slowly in 2019, I began to dust myself back off and pick myself up.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:23):**  And it was what to do with these sheep, because they were characters and I loved them dearly  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:28):**  and they'd seen me through this awful time.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:30):**  There was no way I could go back into meat and death and killing them to make money.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:37):**  So we came up with the idea of the forever flock and that was their payback.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:41):**  They got me through this awful time.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:44):**  Now it's my time that they have a time off from being a commercial animal.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:48):**  So we thought, well, they have to be sheared every year.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:51):**  So let's make a story out of them, of we're preserving them.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:10:57):**  They're still doing ecological good, but I wanted to try and find a way of finding worth  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:03):**  from them without killing them.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:05):**  Actually I used to find myself once I'd move them, I would just sit down with them.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:10):**  And it was a really peaceful, you know, it was just a peaceful practice to do was sit  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:14):**  and watch them graze and happily graze on their fresh pasture.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:17):**  We've got grumpy ones and bullies and we've got funny ones and we've got curious, curious,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:22):**  curious guys in there.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:24):**  And we've got happy ones and caring ones and sensitive and shy.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:28):**  And there's ones, there's individuals that work like guards.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:31):**  They're like guard dogs in the flock.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:33):**  And we have very matriarchal old characters that are the leaders and the others trust  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:39):**  them.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:40):**  And there's the huge amount of contact calls that goes on between the whole flock.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:45):**  They're always communicating.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:47):**  I'd seen it already, obviously, because I've been a shepherd for several years, but I was  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:52):**  seeing it in that, okay, these are individual characters I'm now going to stay with for  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:57):**  a very long time.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:11:59):**  Because I think when people say sheep, you know, sheep are sheep and they just see white  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:03):**  fluffy sheep.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:04):**  But with, well, one of the things that helps with ours are the Shetland Icelandic crosses.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:08):**  So they're all multicolored and they're very different looking individuals anyway.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:13):**  But I wanted to, when people were starting to buy the wall, I wanted to share the stories  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:18):**  of what I was seeing in the field with these sheep.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:22):**  So that's how we've started to go about selling our wall now.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:25):**  We call them by the names and we tell the buyers of the wall a little bit about the  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:30):**  characters of each of the sheep.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:34):**  It was interesting because when we were at Village Farm, we had a local neighbor who  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:38):**  was into felting and asked for some of the rugs to be made into felted sheep skins.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:43):**  And so she did it there.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:45):**  And this is the great thing with a felted rug is no animal has lost its life.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:50):**  So if someone hasn't seen one of these rugs, essentially when it's thrown down on the floor  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:55):**  on the back of a settee, it looks like a sheepskin.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:12:58):**  But when you flip it over, it's felted on the back.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:02):**  So you have all of the benefit of a sheepskin rug and no animal has lost its life.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:09):**  When we're at shearing time, we write the name of the ewe as we're rolling up the fleece.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:15):**  And then when Rosie comes to make this rug, she emails me to say, okay, we're making,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:20):**  say, like Marmite's rug is being made at the moment.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:23):**  So I run out and take a photo of Marmite.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:26):**  And then I have to write a little bit about Marmite's personality.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:29):**  And that goes back to Rosie.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:31):**  And all of that encompassed goes to the buyer.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:36):**  And so it goes onto the website.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:37):**  So not only do you have the name of the sheep, you have a photo of the sheep.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:41):**  And this is really popular because people are connecting with the animal.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:45):**  And for me, it's lovely when Rosie is saying, actually, they're not just buying it on the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:49):**  colour, they're buying it on the personality.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:51):**  They love the story behind this individual.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:13:54):**  And on a more sort of, I suppose, a more personhood type way, we're giving agency back to the  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:04):**  animal who created this fleece in the first place.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:07):**  This isn't just the craftsperson who has made this.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:09):**  This is the individual sheep behind this as well.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:14):**  And so there's this real link buyers now have.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:17):**  And some people are framing their photos of the sheep beside their fleece.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:23):**  And it's a, I mean, it's wonderful, I think, of completely changing the personality of  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:30):**  sheep in the UK.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:31):**  And people are so proud of it.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:34):**  And now the great thing is they want another fleece from the same sheep because they're  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:40):**  there.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:41):**  So they want matching ones.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:42):**  So we really like, I don't know, whoever it is, Duckies Fleece, please can we have another  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:47):**  one?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:48):**  We've got one on the back of the chair, we've got another chair or settee and we'd love  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:50):**  another one to match.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:51):**  So it's all that this goes on as well.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:14:55):**  This has come from a personal choice of mine, but I still holistically plan graze the forever  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:02):**  flock.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:03):**  They're still doing the same land maintenance that they were doing when we were putting  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:08):**  them through into meat sales.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:10):**  That bit hasn't changed at all.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:11):**  And I actually think I've seen the importance of animals on the land.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:17):**  I've seen the health benefits to the local ecology, if done correctly, and I've seen  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:24):**  the health benefits to the soil.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:27):**  And the forever flock, now they are just a fiber flock, their ecological stance within  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:34):**  our landscape is exactly the same.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:36):**  So I still see them as an integral part of the ecology here.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:42):**  This is just a sort of a personal choice within how I'm using these sheep and how they're  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:48):**  sort of the interface between the general public and the way of making an income from  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:54):**  them.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:15:56):**  The fact is, is obviously if you do the nuts and bolts and you're just very pragmatic about  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:03):**  this and hard nosed, you will get a lot more money from killing an animal than getting  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:09):**  the wool from the animal.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:10):**  The usual prices for wool in this country are just horrifically bad.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:16):**  But by having this beautiful fleece and by having the animal alive and the whole story  
**[0:16:23-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:23):**  and the narrative of what they're doing to benefit nature, then we're able to get a top  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:32):**  price for those fleeces.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:34):**  And I suppose I'm putting this out for someone who's going, well, surely you can't make money  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:38):**  doing this.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:39):**  If I took on doing secondary product, made manufacturer or created something from that  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:45):**  wool, then yes, we would make a nice income from the wool.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:49):**  As it is at the moment, the wool covers the price of looking after the sheep.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:54):**  So they pay for themselves.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:16:56):**  I wouldn't say I make an income from them because I'm doing secondary incomes, but if  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:00):**  I wanted to make an income from them and that would mean some way of processing the wool  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:06):**  into other goods, then yes, you could make an income from doing this.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:11):**  Obviously, I've been through this rather personal, painful journey to get to where I am today.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:21):**  And we're all energy and life ending.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:24):**  And do we really end life?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:26):**  You know, when I go, when I pop my clogs one day, I'm going to go into the soil and the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:31):**  worms and the microbes are going to eat me and there's my energy into them.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:35):**  And then the energy from them is going to go into a plant.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:38):**  My energy will end up in plants.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:40):**  And then the energy in the plants will be ending up into the animals.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:44):**  And then depending where they are on the food chain, if they're small animals, they're going  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:48):**  to be predated on bigger animals.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:50):**  And eventually those animals are going to die and back they go into the soil.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:53):**  And there is that energy cycle going on the whole time.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:56):**  That energy never goes.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:17:58):**  And I suppose what, whether you're vegan or actually it's not even a vegan type question,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:05):**  it's where you like that energy.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:07):**  And right now I rather like the energy in those sheep.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:11):**  And then, you know, and I like the characters of those sheep and I don't want to end that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:15):**  energy there for me.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:17):**  But other people may want to end that energy and may want to put it into the circle of  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:21):**  life a bit quicker than I do.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:27):**  As Rebecca acknowledged, farming is full of life and death.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:32):**  And at the core of agroecological farming is to cultivate a good life and a good death  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:37):**  for all beings in this cycle of life.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:40):**  That's something that I think when you farm, you do start to really understand is, you  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:47):**  face up to is that death is an unavoidable part of this life.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:54):**  I think it's something, you know, we're all told and we know.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:18:57):**  But as a farmer, you actually live that, recurringly.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:02):**  Whether you're farming crops or with animals or anything, it's like these cycles of life  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:09):**  are happening all the time and the energy is flowing in many different ways.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:16):**  I guess farmers really have to understand or have the opportunity to work with both  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:22):**  life and death on a regular basis.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:26):**  And I think that's something that people outside the farming community don't really  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:30):**  acknowledge fully or understand.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:33):**  It's something I think we could explore further.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:41):**  Nicole Masters is an agroecologist, systems thinker and educator, originally from New

**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:48):**  She's the director of an agroecological consultancy, Integrity Soils, and recently published a  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:54):**  brilliant book, definitely recommend it, For the Love of Soil.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:19:58):**  Nicole's a bounty of knowledge about many different regenerative techniques and she  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:03):**  offers a number of online courses for farmers and coaching for advisors.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:08):**  She gave us the lowdown on bio-priming and explained why it can be an important part  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:12):**  of a more regenerative approach to farming.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:15):**  There's a process of what we call bio-priming, so using different types of products that  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:20):**  we can put onto seed to support that plant's defense system and a process called ISR, so  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:27):**  induced systemic responses.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:29):**  And also in terms of looking at trace elements, of lifting the quality of what you're growing.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:35):**  So if you're seeing things like viruses and aphids and insects attacking, it's really  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:39):**  telling you that there's something nutritionally and biologically off with the crop that you're  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:43):**  trying to grow and no one wants to grow a subpar product.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:46):**  So some of these bio-priming processes, we can actually add bio-control agents to the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:53):**  seed.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:54):**  So some of these are what they're called entomopathogenic fungi, and I don't know who comes up with  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:20:59):**  these words, but people that like really big words.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:01):**  And basically what they are is a fungus that will live inside the plant like an endophyte,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:08):**  and when an insect chews on it, it infects that insect and basically turns it into a  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:12):**  mummy and then it spreads out spores.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:15):**  It's really, really cool.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:16):**  So there's a number of those that you can use as seed treatments in transition while  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:20):**  you're trying to build up your soil health and not resort to some of these really ghastly  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:24):**  chemicals.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:27):**  It's something that has happened for centuries, especially if you look at Korean natural farming  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:32):**  or some of the technologies coming out of India.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:35):**  And what's fascinating is that there's so much research that's been coming out in the  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:39):**  last two or three years about the benefits of bio-priming.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:43):**  So bio-priming means that we're going to put some kind of biological catalyst or microbial  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:49):**  inoculant on seed.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:51):**  So if you think about that little seed, there is a microbiome inside that seed and on the  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:21:57):**  outside of that seed, and the research on that's really very, very new.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:02):**  The reason for that is that the minute that that plant starts to germinate, that microbiology  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:07):**  goes out and is absorbing different types of nutrients, solubilizing different types  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:13):**  of nutrients, and then as that plant grows in that process known as rhizophagy, they'll  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:18):**  actually absorb that bacteria again, blow open their cell walls and absorb those nutrients.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:23):**  So there's this feeding process.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:25):**  So they say between 30 to 100% of the nutrients that's coming into a seedling actually comes  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:30):**  from this biological process.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:32):**  So if you're planting a seed naked or with fungicides and pesticides on it into a fairly  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:38):**  hostile environment, you're not going to get these benefits.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:42):**  And then we have a situation where you're going to need to apply pesticides or fungicides.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:47):**  So these microbes are producing all sorts of compounds.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:51):**  So these compounds are eliciting plant responses in terms of them being able to prime or being  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:22:59):**  able to respond by increasing their defense molecules or the enzymes or proteins.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:05):**  So like proteinase, which is what the plant uses to defend itself from insects, is primed  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:10):**  by microbiology.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:12):**  So when we're talking about these different types of biopriming agents, we can do things  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:19):**  like compost extracts or vermicast, so the worm extracts, putting that directly onto  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:24):**  seed as a liquid or as something that we can put on as a dried product when we're drilling.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:30):**  And what they contain are all sorts of those humic compounds.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:34):**  They got minerals, they got plant growth promotants in them, enzymes, hormones, the quorum signaling  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:40):**  metabolites.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:43):**  So there's all sorts of things that we can actually use as even commercial products like  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:46):**  trichoderma, lactobacillus, aspergillus, so our nitrogen fixers, mycorrhizae.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:23:54):**  And what's amazing, they just contain such a huge variety of these secondary metabolites,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:00):**  things that plants use for defense and health that we couldn't even fathom being able to  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:05):**  add these things as individuals.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:08):**  What's exciting is to see that in the literature, the effect that these biopriming agents are  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:14):**  having in terms of seed germination, in terms of yield, in terms of the need to be adding  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:20):**  all of these other chemical products and instead going, how do I support this plant optimally  
**[0:24:25-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:25):**  so that it's healthy, so that I don't need to be putting all of this other junk in basically,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:32):**  and then at the end of the day, we're going to be more profitable.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:36):**  Yay.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:37):**  Thank you.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:38):**  Probably wondering if that sounds quite complicated.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:40):**  And what I'm finding is probably nearly all of our clients now are doing these things  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:47):**  themselves.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:48):**  So you can make your own vermicast very, very simply with any kind of farm waste materials,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:53):**  so manure and straw and wood chips and wood shavings or anything like that, and feed that  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:24:59):**  to worms and it creates a highly concentrated biological product that we can put down with  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:04):**  the seed.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:05):**  You can also make your own compost.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:07):**  And the thing here is you can buy these products commercially, you just got to ensure that  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:12):**  they really are top quality because you're resting your whole farm on that this is going  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:18):**  to be successful.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:19):**  And if you're buying what we call municipal waste compost, so compost that's come from  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:23):**  the cities where maybe they're not thinking, how do I make a good product for a farmer?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:28):**  What they're thinking is how do I get rid of waste?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:31):**  Those products typically aren't very biologically diverse.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:34):**  They're generally full of bacteria, they're not going to have all this disease suppression  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:39):**  that you need.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:42):**  So thinking long term, do we need to continue to do biopriming?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:46):**  And what I find is for my cropping guys anyway, probably.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:50):**  I mean, it's something that's not very expensive.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:53):**  It's very simple to do once you have your systems up and running.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:25:57):**  You're going into systems where, I mean, hopefully you're not cultivating, but you might be  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:02):**  cultivating or you might be spraying with herbicides.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:05):**  So we still have this, it's like earning the right to get off the inputs.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:11):**  And until we stop those kinds of disturbance mechanisms, you're going to need to be able  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:15):**  to help to repair that system.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:18):**  But if you're in a perennial grassland system, then absolutely not, you're not going to need  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:21):**  to keep this up if you have really good management.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:26):**  So I've been asked why we don't call ourselves consultants.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:30):**  So there's this expectation in agriculture that you're going to get a consultant and  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:33):**  they're going to tell you what to do.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:35):**  Whereas regenerative agriculture is actually a mindset shift.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:39):**  It's learning how to learn again, learning how to observe, learning how to shift a whole  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:45):**  worldview really around insects and diseases.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:48):**  And so we find the most successful way to really imparting long term change where you're  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:54):**  not going to require someone to hold your hand because actually you can figure this  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:26:58):**  stuff out yourself is through coaching.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:00):**  So we work alongside farmers and viticulture and water culture and ranches in terms of  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:09):**  what do you see, what are your goals, what's going to be the best fit here and ensuring  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:15):**  that we don't have these kind of long term inputs.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:18):**  How do we get off these inputs?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:19):**  But that really happens through knowledge.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:22):**  And I think a lot of modern agriculture is really trying people to stop being creative  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:26):**  and stop that kind of thinking.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:28):**  So learning to really think diagnostically is it's a long term journey.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:35):**  And so it's something that we see that actually this is where the coaching needs to come in.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:40):**  And if we look at the massive expansion in regenerative agriculture, the biggest missing  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:44):**  is having really highly trained coaches to help support that transition because that  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:51):**  transition period can be really, really scary, especially if you've got a lot of debt and  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:56):**  someone saying to you, hey, question everything.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:27:59):**  That's really easy to get overwhelmed and just go, I'm just going to stick with what  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:02):**  I know.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:03):**  And we can't stick with what we know.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:05):**  We don't have the time.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:06):**  We don't have we don't have the public license, quite frankly, to continue with the use of  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:11):**  some of these chemicals that we're doing or the land degradation or what how much land  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:17):**  is actually affecting climate change.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:19):**  So we're seeing a lens shine in on agriculture now that it hasn't done in the past.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:23):**  And the only way we're going to be able to stand up proud to confront that light shining  
**[0:28:27-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/63-indian-farmers-protests-the-forever-flock-and-biopriming#t=0:28:27):**  on us is to be doing these practices regeneratively.

### Farmerama  (2017-05-28)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  This month's episode is a little different to usual, as we weave in and out of a conversation  we had with Dame Fiona Reynolds, former Director General of the National Trust.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:19):**  Her book, The Fight for Beauty, is a call to arms for us all to pay more attention to  matters of the earth and oceans, as she charts the power of the people and campaigns through  hundreds of years of land disputes in the UK.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  Of course, farming and fishing communities feature heavily in this fight.  We caught up with Fiona and she told us how she sees farming fits into the future of a  Britain built on beauty.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:45):**  We are well aware that beauty seems a little airy-fairy and disconnected from the realities  of running a farming business, but please do hear us out to the end.  I was a bit sceptical at first as well, and still have some questions around it, but I  
**[0:00:59-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:59):**  do think there is something there that we can all identify with.  Plus, we're going to hear what some farmers think about beauty, and some of the other  issues which come up in our chat, such as rewilding.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:11):**  We get to listen in to Martin Peck asking his long-time neighbour and fellow upland  sheep farmer, Rhys Roberts, for some of his thoughts.  Here's a bit about Rhys.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  Rhys Roberts from Dufferin Tannacht, which is a valley in north-east Wales.  I'm an upland farmer, although the farms in this area are more what we call in this area  Havard and Hendre, which is a traditional way of farming, valley bottom up to the mountain.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:40):**  In our case, the valley bottom is at 450 foot above sea level, and the top of our hill mountain  is 2200.  So typical of the area, it rapidly rises to the top of the Berywyn range.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  And we sheep farmers.  I have been dairy in the past, but as I got older and slowed down, I've never beefened  sheep.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  We, as a family, have lived in this area for generations, and hope to continue living in  this area for generations.  We will hear more from Rhys later, but a big thanks to Martin for taking the time to record  
**[0:02:15-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  Rhys, and for Rhys being so honest and willing to let us know what he thinks.  It's brilliant to hear the views of an upland sheep farmer.  This voice is so often missing from the debate.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:27):**  You will also hear from spiritual ecologist and the artist behind the milking parlor,  Nessie Reid.  Here she is telling us a bit about herself.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:36):**  My name is Nessie Reid, and I am creator of the milking parlor, which is an ongoing art  project looking at the future of our food system and engaging the public in thinking  about where our food comes from and the politics behind our food.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  And I'm also a fellow at the St. Ethelberger's Spiritual Ecology Fellowship, which is a year-long  fellowship looking into how do we apply the principles of spiritual ecology to our work.  And so the conversation with Fiona begins.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  We start with beauty.  I don't see beauty as just about aesthetics or the sort of superficial attractiveness of  a place.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:17):**  I see beauty almost as a sense of moral purpose.  It's a way of looking at the world, of valuing the things that money can't buy, of recognizing  there's a sort of spiritual connection that we have through valuing the kind of unquantifiable.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:30):**  And I get really nervous when people say, oh, let's make beauty a sort of part of this  exercise or try and corral it in some way.  Because for me, it is about values.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  So one of the reasons I'm so passionate about reviving the fight for beauty is I think it  gives people a language that they can use when they're not experts.  People can feel intimidated by the planning system and having to justify in technical  
**[0:03:53-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:53):**  ways why this place is special or basically being challenged by highly paid experts from  the developer side that say, you don't know anything.  Your voice doesn't matter.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:06):**  And I want to empower people to just speak up for places they love and to be able to  feel they can defend them and to use arguments that are meaningful to them without having  to kind of turn it into an econometric argument or some sort of scientific process.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:20):**  So actually, I've got lots of experiences in my life where local people have tried to  protect places like that and have been stamped on by the process of bureaucracy and economism,  which is the word that we use in my book.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  But for myself, I can remember fighting planning applications against quarry developments in  the Peak District National Parks and the Yorkshire Dales National Park and determinedly of using  the arguments for beauty and sometimes winning and sometimes not winning.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:52):**  But I do think it's about empowering people.  That's why I think the word beauty is so important because as an individual, it's a word that  we use all the time.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  It's just you never hear it used in official language anymore.  It's liberating to just use words that we feel comfortable with in everyday life.  And I'm trying to sort of in a sense empower people to speak from the heart with confidence  
**[0:05:17-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:17):**  about the vital importance of beautiful places to our general quality of life.  I mean, we are at a point in our society where we can't go on getting richer because we're  using natural resources at a high pace.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:29):**  We've diminished the quality of our own natural resource base.  We can't just go on seeking material progress.  We have to start accepting that a different kind of progress is going to be beneficial  
**[0:05:41-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:41):**  to the planet and beneficial to us if we see it that way.  And beauty to me is a way into those arguments, a way of opening our hearts out to a different  kind of future.  
**[0:05:50-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  That's really beautiful.  I've never heard someone say that that way and reframe what's often sold to us as, well,  you just are going to have to have a worse life.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  We really love the idea of using the word beauty to empower all people to have a say  in what happens to the landscapes around them.  We asked Nessie and Rhys what beauty means to them.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  For me, beauty relates to a state of the heart.  When I find something beautiful, I can feel my heart aching and sometimes something can  be almost too beautiful that it aches tremendously.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  When I look at the man I love, sometimes it's painfully beautiful.  And then I think also beauty is not just about functionality.  Some functional things can be beautiful, but for me beauty serves a higher purpose than  
**[0:06:51-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:51):**  just a day-to-day living and a day-to-day functionality.  It's speaking to a place within our hearts and within our souls that that day-to-day  life doesn't necessarily do.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:03):**  We all have an opinion about beauty and what it is.  Some people think that it's not necessarily beauty in the eyes of the beholder.  For me, it's my family, it's my area.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:16):**  We all have ideas of what beauty is.  But the concern, if we take it into a wider perspective, is that while the nation would  feel that they want to protect what is deemed to be beautiful, and maybe in countryside  
**[0:07:32-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:32):**  designations of outstanding natural beauty would be one thing, and the public require  certain elements of beauty to be protected, it is very dangerous for, particularly civil  servants or people who are influenced by various economic and maybe even planning drivers,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:58):**  decide what is beautiful and what is not.  Beauty is an interesting word, isn't it?  And they're using the Welsh language, it's arddoch, which is not necessarily as a fundamental  
**[0:08:10-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  word as perhaps beauty would be in English.  It's more of a general term, and other verbs and adjectives are used to add to it depending  on what the context is.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  At the same time, it's interesting that any discussion concentrate on one word, because  one word is not wide enough very often to describe what you're talking about.  And now back to Fiona.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  We pick up the conversation talking about planning and sustainable land use.  I do think land is the forgotten resource in this country.  I think we've taken it for granted for too long, everyone thinks that there's always  
**[0:08:45-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:45):**  going to be plenty of land, and yet if you look at what we've done, particularly since  the Industrial Revolution, we've squandered land, we've used land too intensively, we  have had a planning system which I'm enormously passionate about, but we have also made some  
**[0:08:58-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:58):**  bad mistakes.  So to me, if we put land at the centre of our vision for this country, I think we'd  do a better job.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  How do you think small-scale farmers could start to see some space to access that land  and make a positive contribution to the beauty of the landscape?  Well, I think there's basically a big decision that's got to be made about whether land is  
**[0:09:22-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:22):**  used for farming, used for urban development, and of course, there are many other demands  we place on it for infrastructure, for housing and all the rest of it.  But I think when it comes to rural land, it does seem to me that the kind of old principle  
**[0:09:36-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:36):**  – you aren't making it any more, you need to protect the productivity and the wellbeing  of the land as a fundamental objective of policy – I think is absolutely critical.  So I would like to see all land that is farmed farmed well in a profoundly sustainable way,  
**[0:09:54-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:54):**  but also producing multiple outputs.  We live in a small country with a big population, we can't afford for land just to have one  function – it's got to deliver for farming, it's got to deliver for nature, it's got  
**[0:10:05-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  to deliver for people's wellbeing, it's got to deliver those wider public goods.  So to me, farmers, large or small, actually, have absolutely got a critical role to play  in that.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  So do you know anyone who's already doing things to reform land use in that way?  Well, there are a lot of organisations that are really campaigning now in this new Brexit  world for better land use policies.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, you've got organisations like CPRE, the one I used to work for, who are doing  a great job on land use strategy from a kind of a more planning perspective.  There are organisations like the National Trust that own great tracts of land, there  
**[0:10:40-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  are RSPB wildlife trusts, there are lots and lots of organisations.  But I'm not quite sure anybody has this really strong focus on sustainable land use as the  absolute core of what we should be trying to achieve post Brexit in the new world.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:55):**  Where would you put your energy?  Well, I'd put my energy in two places.  I'd put it as much in sustainable cities as I would in sustainable countryside, because  
**[0:11:05-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:05):**  you can't do one without the other.  We need to make our cities beautiful, sustainable, healthy, good places to live.  And we also need to make our rural areas productive, but productive in a sustainable sense.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:18):**  Places where people can also get those wider benefits from, you know, fresh air, enjoyment  of the outdoors, wildlife, all of the things that really matter, but that we have rather  lost in the last 50 years or so.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  So I think we've got to have a kind of integrated strategy where both the urban areas and the  rural areas have to work to new objectives.  What do you think about the rewilding debate and the idea that often farmers are pitted  
**[0:11:46-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:46):**  against the rewilders?  I'm going to start with a bit of context here, because our landscape is essentially a farm  landscape and has been for several thousand years.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:59):**  We have in the process massively diminished its natural capital, if you like, particularly  the resource through biodiversity and wildlife.  And we've got to get it back, this is for sure.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:11):**  But I think there's a choice between the way that we get it back, either by kind of literally  setting aside and rewilding places, or through a different vision for farming.  And my own passionate preference is for a different vision for farming, because that  
**[0:12:26-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:26):**  allows you to, over a huge area, do things better.  Now that doesn't mean there aren't places where nature would take precedence, but I  worry that the rewilding debate does absolutely divide people into two camps who say, you  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:41):**  know, you can't do farming and wildlife together, you have to either do wildlife over here and  farming over there, or kind of accept that somehow you've got a kind of unbridgeable  chasm.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  And I think that rewilding will have a place, of course, but a much more important debate  is how to make farming much better for wildlife, so that the majority of our countryside can  be farmed sustainably.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:04):**  We don't have the luxury in this country of huge expanses of land that aren't near where  anybody lives, as they do in some of the bigger continents or whatever.  We certainly, I think we do have a place for beavers in this country without question.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  And what you're talking about is a gradation, you know, there will be some areas that are  still, you know, where production is the main purpose, the majority purpose, and there will  be others on a sort of sliding scale where nature is much more dominant.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:30):**  And I think the hills and uplands are places where, you know, nature would take a much,  much stronger role, partly because the economics of what we produce for food there is very  questionable and highly influenced by the old CAP, which we're not going to have anymore,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  so we can choose to make all that much, much better for nature.  So I'm not so worried about the kind of internal tensions between beavers and trees and all  the rest of it, because actually I think it's much more important we have a look at how,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:57):**  you know, we get that much bigger picture view of, particularly in our hills and uplands,  of much less intensive farming within which there will be places for beavers, but there  will still be, I bet, and rightly so, some production going on.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah, because I know some upland sheep farmers, and they're the people who are the most angry  about the rewilding debate, because they're often sectioned off as like the least productive,  so they're the first to go.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  So what would you say to them?  Well, I've been working with hill farmers all my life.  My grandfather was a hill farmer, and I'm a really passionate advocate for hill farmers,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:37):**  because I also believe that we have a cultural landscape.  You know, this is an landscape made by and for and with people, and it's not something  that you can just sort of sweep aside centuries of a really important part of our culture.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:53):**  Farming in the uplands will change, of course, because it is an artificial construct, but  it should not be without people.  It should not be without sheep.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  I have to say, I love sheep.  We have got too many of them at the moment, but I love sheep, and I think they're part  of our history and our future.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  So I think it's this question about degradation, about saying in some places that, you know,  sheep farming will be much less economic, but it shouldn't go.  And much of the Lake District, for example, you know, I would passionately defend hill  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:24):**  farming in the Lake District, but it'd probably be less intense.  It would be structured and supported in a different way, and it would produce other  benefits alongside it.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:33):**  It's great to hear Fiona sees the value in upland hill farmers, but not everyone does.  Martin asked Rhys about the life of an upland sheep farmer and what he felt about the rewilding  debate.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:45):**  What would you say is unique about upland sheep farmers?  That's a good question, I think.  I don't know that unique is not a word I would use because people are the same, farmers are  
**[0:15:55-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:55):**  the same, plumbers are the same, the world over in the sense, in the general sense.  I think probably upland farmers have to live in isolation very often, or communities are  fairly isolated communities, and therefore they create their own communities and their  
**[0:16:12-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:12):**  own, the driving force is to live with nature and communicate with the outside world when  they need to and when they want to.  So it's a little bit of that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:24):**  It's not isolation, unless it's by choice.  It's just the environment they live in, really.  So I suppose that's not necessarily unique, but it's singularly a requirement if you're  
**[0:16:36-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:36):**  an upland farmer, you have to adapt to that way of life.  We understand what the very seasons and the various moods of the weather will have its  effect on us, really.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  So we have to be very aware of how those things work.  What do you think about the idea of rewilding parts of Britain?  Maybe what does rewilding mean to you?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  I've struggled with that.  My first reaction, I probably still believe it, is that it's an idea certain people have  
**[0:17:10-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:10):**  expounded as a marquee idea that they suddenly dreamt in the middle of the night.  The thing about rewilding, as I understand it, and I don't pretend to understand how  George Mombio thought processes work, ignores a lot of reality.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:30):**  We're all very, very concerned about conservation and protecting our environment.  Nobody I believe has the right to think that they have the monopoly on good ideas or wisdom.  In the case of rewilding, as I was saying, I think they are ignoring some realities.  
**[0:17:49-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:49):**  By rewilding, we reintroduce species that are not necessarily endangered because they  exist in Europe.  It's not a problem for the genetics and that side of it.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  It's some idea that the whole structure of the upland areas, particularly, maybe other  areas as well, can be changed to some prehistoric scenario.  I really do think that people who think about rewilding in terms of bringing in species  
**[0:18:20-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:20):**  that perhaps weren't here before, and sadly the dodo is not one of the options that they  can do unless the scientists can work some miracle, should concentrate on the endangered  species that already have a problem in Britain.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:33):**  I think by working together, the upland farmer, the lowland farmer, conservationist, those  so-called intellectuals could do far more good for their environment and have these  marquee ideas that mean nothing in reality.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:48):**  Point is, it's an endanger to the people who live in those communities.  Do you really want to lose the people that live in these communities?  Because that is the risk that you take.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:59):**  Removing what Mr. Monbiot calls the white maggots of sheep, doesn't do anything necessarily  to sheep because they'll go somewhere else, they'll be kept somewhere else, but it will  remove the communities.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:11):**  And I don't think we can afford to lose those.  That pool of expertise and great interest in the countryside that people living in upland  communities have.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:22):**  The resource that we have in the upland areas, we can talk at length about air and water,  clean air, clean water, all these things, carbon sink, they're all very, very important  and we need to preserve them and nurture them as best we can.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:39):**  But I really do think that one of those primary elements is food as well, and the production  of food for the community.  And this is what the upland area does that some people would think, well let the lowland  
**[0:19:50-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  areas do that and we can have the upland areas catering for some other need that community  has, community benefit.  But community benefits from, nobody in the lowlands will keep the sheep for instance  
**[0:20:02-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:02):**  that the nation would require.  You'd have to import them from denuded areas of Australia or New Zealand in the end that  don't have the same principles perhaps sometimes that we would have, especially if there is  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  care taken.  Yes, again it's difficult for me not to...  You be quiet Martin, you just ask the questions.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  Yeah, no it's really good.  What would be lost would be the people.  What would be gained would be, it depends how, rewilding or ecological rebalancing,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  how it would be played.  But what I fear is people who don't really understand these areas and the need to be  in control.  
**[0:20:47-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  So what would be lost is people with proper understanding of what's needed.  It really does worry me that you hear statements from politicians and groupings of so-called  charities who say, oh well let the lowlands produce the food and the uplands do something  
**[0:21:05-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:05):**  else.  That is so insulting to the intelligence of those people who live in the various areas.  It's a patchwork, it's a mosaic.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:16):**  How anybody could be so simplistic as to talk in those terms is very worrying.  Nessie also had a few thoughts on what rewilding means to her.  Something quite different altogether.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  When we talk about rewilding it's not just a rewilding of our natural landscapes, it's  a rewilding of ourselves, of that beauty.  And I think it's a stripping from a Buddhist perspective, which is what I come from.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:40):**  How do we strip away the incessant, endless, nagging noise of the mind?  And how do we rewild and repopulate our mind with much bigger, much more important stories?  And I think when we look at things like cosmology and our bigger place in the human history,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:56):**  we need to think about what kind of mark are we going to leave behind and what do we stand  for?  And I want that to be a beautiful one.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:03):**  I want the architecture to be beautiful.  I want our science to be beautiful.  And I suppose when I say beautiful, I mean ultimately serving the greater good of humanity.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:13):**  So going back to rewilding, I think it's really about how do we rewild ourselves, but also  how do we live in landscapes where it's not just completely anthracentric, where it becomes  more biocentric, where nature is valued and revered and respected, rather than man always  
**[0:22:30-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:30):**  having to have such great dominion.  And finally, back to Fiona for her thoughts on putting all this into policy and practice.  An ideal vision would be where we valued all the products from the land and found a kind  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:49):**  of harmony between them.  So of course we're going to produce food.  We need to produce food, but we also have a crisis in nature.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:57):**  We also have major human benefits that we need from land.  We also have things that we didn't understand 20 or 30 years ago, like protection against  flooding and those other sort of wider land uses.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  And we have a much stronger need to protect our soil and the integrity of our soil.  I think for me it isn't about being prescriptive, but it is about having an ambition for harmony,  for making decisions at a relatively local level that are based on the particular qualities  
**[0:23:29-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  and characteristics of that area, but which also try to balance off, if you like, the  best way of delivering multiple outputs from the land.  I'm sure you read the CPRE report and their new model farming section.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:43):**  What did you think of that?  I think there are loads of ideas in that that I would completely agree with, actually.  But it won't be, you know, nobody will just pick that up and implement it.  
**[0:23:51-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:51):**  I think what we're looking for out of this change is we're looking for a simpler farm  policy.  You know, the common agricultural policy is fraught with bureaucracy and complications.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  I think we're looking for some high-level principles that are about multiple objectives,  about sustainability, about soil protection, about nature's revival, about public benefit.  But we're also looking, I think, for more delegated responsibility to local level where  
**[0:24:21-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  the detail of what incentives are given and what encouragement are given to farmers is  attuned to the character and the need of particular areas.  We don't try and prescribe it all from the centre, but we do recognise that there is  
**[0:24:36-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:36):**  diversity in our landscape and we need to reflect that in policy.  What would you say to farmers going forward about subsidies?  Well, I haven't got a new one in my pocket, but I do think that we do need to support  
**[0:24:49-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:49):**  sustainable farming in this country.  I don't think it would survive in a free market environment.  And actually, some of the lessons we've learned of the past, and you know, my book charts  
**[0:24:59-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:59):**  painfully all the fights we had.  In fact, we have learned some very good skills about how to support environmentally responsible  farming through initially the ESA process, through country-centred stewardship, through  
**[0:25:13-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:13):**  all of these pillar two kind of payments.  And I don't think we should throw that knowledge away.  We should remember, you know, where we've come from.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:22):**  So I think we do need some high-level principles which everybody, every farmer has to accede  to.  You can't trash the soil, you can't fundamentally, you know, damage nature, and you do need to  
**[0:25:35-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:35):**  produce food in a sustainable way.  But then I think there will be subsidies available for particular benefits delivered.  And some of that may be for certain food crops.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:47):**  Still, there may well be a case, more vegetables actually, we've never subsidised vegetables,  maybe because of the questions of diet and all the rest of it, we'll need to do that.  Those are discussions we need to have, but I think more importantly it will be clear  
**[0:25:59-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:59):**  that there will be certain public benefits that won't be delivered unless they're subsidised.  And that's where, you know, the work's going on about wildlife landscape, heritage,  flood protection, soil conservation, you know, those things will all be, I think, necessarily  
**[0:26:16-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:16):**  supported under a new system.  Farming is inherently a very risky business and for very little reward economically, generally.  So a lot of farmers would say, oh, it's all very well talking about beauty and nature,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:29):**  but you know, our livelihood's on the line, so of course I'll spray the chemicals or I'll  add the nitrogen or I'll cut down the trees.  What's the retort to that?  
**[0:26:41-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:41):**  I think it depends entirely on what you're trying to produce.  I mean, if you're trying to produce food as cheaply as possible with very low environmental  standards to meet a trade deal with, say, America, for the sake of argument, then of  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  course that's how, you know, that's how the picture will look.  But you know what?  In the UK we could have a much better vision than that.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:01):**  We could have a vision to be a clean, green country that has high standards of production,  high standards of animal welfare, high standards of, you know, industrial policy, and that  our exports are, if you like, the best in the world.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:14):**  But then if our subsidy system and our regulatory system was designed to sustain that, actually  that would frame the economic, you know, proposition that farmers would buy into, and they wouldn't  be therefore just trying to, you know, drive to the bottom and drive for the cheapest outcome,  
**[0:27:30-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:30):**  because actually the system would be constructed around something that was high quality, good  for the environment, and good for, you know, the broader sort of reputation of the UK.  So I think it depends entirely on how we construct the vision.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  I fear the race for the bottom.  I think many people do.  But actually we have a choice.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  We could do it completely the other way, and that would give farmers for the first time  a sense that they were entirely in tune, if you like, with what the nation wanted from  them and not somehow fighting against it.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:01):**  Actually farmers also say, we are conservationists in our blood, and I think we should take that  at face value and design a system that plays to that desire.  Farmers say they have to be stewards, to be farming in a way that's good for the future,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:17):**  as well as good for today.  And you know, that's a challenge I think, to design a system that genuinely supports  that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:24):**  But then one other side to that debate is like, how do we produce food for people who,  you know, have low incomes?  Where do they fit into that picture?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:31):**  Well, I think that's where, again, it's this question about integration.  At the moment, our social policies don't really have much to say about food and diets, don't  have much to say about healthy eating, about, you know, well-being.  
**[0:28:45-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:45):**  But it's entirely possible to design a system which says that, you know, as part of the  sort of social subsidy network, for people in genuine need, there is hope for people  to have access to healthy food and to be supported to, whether it's grow their own, which isn't  
**[0:29:01-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:01):**  practical everybody, but cook from ingredients rather than buying prepackaged food.  You know, there are things we could do.  There's a whole raft of ambitions for the education system about teaching children to  
**[0:29:12-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:12):**  grow, teaching children to appreciate food, teaching children to enjoy eating vegetables  and, you know, actually know what a healthy diet is.  So, again, it's about joining up and having a much more connected vision rather than saying,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:26):**  oh, dear, people can't afford expensive packaged food, which is true.  And I think this is why, you know, the Brexit debate, which is quite divisive and quite  difficult, you know, has to be a moment where we ask ourselves some really fundamental questions  
**[0:29:40-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:40):**  about the direction we're going and what we want.  And if all we do is go for the cheapest possible production of food, you know, rock bottom  standards, we'll pay for it in one way or another.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:51):**  If in the other hand we say, no, this is a moment where we can right some of the past  wrongs, put together a package which is much more sustainable, much better for society  as a whole, restores our wildlife, but produces food in a sustainable way, then that's the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:06):**  prize I think that we should aim for.  And I genuinely think that beauty as an argument helps to create that positive vision.  Brilliant.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:15):**  Well, I wouldn't say that, but, yes, thank you.  Give me the chance to say a few things.  I hope it's rational because I don't want well sound, you know, fundamentalist one way  
**[0:30:29-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:29):**  or the other.  So there you have it.  A spiritual ecologist, a long time institution leader and policy advisor, and a lifelong  
**[0:30:41-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:41):**  farmer with a range of perspectives on beauty and rewilding.  We hope you've found Fiona's fight for beauty a voice you want to support.  I find it interesting that we're hearing more of these softer words such as harmony and  
**[0:30:56-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:56):**  beauty in a farming context.  I understand Reese's concern of who decides what beauty is, but I think that ultimately  Fiona has shown that throughout history the word can actually be a support to Reese and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:12):**  upland farmers like him.  Beauty is a unifier.  It's a cause that everyone in the community can identify with and fight for.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:23):**  Whether you're convinced about beauty or not, it seems one thing is clear.  Neither Fiona nor Nessie nor Reese believe that it's a good idea to let productivity  be the main thing which shapes our landscape.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:39):**  Thank you for listening and thank you to all our guests and to Joe and Katie who worked  with me to put this episode together.

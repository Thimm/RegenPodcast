### Farmerama  (Sun, 28 May 2017 08:02:23)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:08):**  This month's episode is a little different to usual, as we weave in and out of a conversation  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:13):**  we had with Dame Fiona Reynolds, former Director General of the National Trust.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:19):**  Her book, The Fight for Beauty, is a call to arms for us all to pay more attention to  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:23):**  matters of the earth and oceans, as she charts the power of the people and campaigns through  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:29):**  hundreds of years of land disputes in the UK.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  Of course, farming and fishing communities feature heavily in this fight.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:38):**  We caught up with Fiona and she told us how she sees farming fits into the future of a  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:42):**  Britain built on beauty.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:45):**  We are well aware that beauty seems a little airy-fairy and disconnected from the realities  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:50):**  of running a farming business, but please do hear us out to the end.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:55):**  I was a bit sceptical at first as well, and still have some questions around it, but I  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:00:59):**  do think there is something there that we can all identify with.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:03):**  Plus, we're going to hear what some farmers think about beauty, and some of the other  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:07):**  issues which come up in our chat, such as rewilding.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:11):**  We get to listen in to Martin Peck asking his long-time neighbour and fellow upland  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:15):**  sheep farmer, Rhys Roberts, for some of his thoughts.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:20):**  Here's a bit about Rhys.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  Rhys Roberts from Dufferin Tannacht, which is a valley in north-east Wales.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:28):**  I'm an upland farmer, although the farms in this area are more what we call in this area  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:34):**  Havard and Hendre, which is a traditional way of farming, valley bottom up to the mountain.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:40):**  In our case, the valley bottom is at 450 foot above sea level, and the top of our hill mountain  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:48):**  is 2200.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:49):**  So typical of the area, it rapidly rises to the top of the Berywyn range.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  And we sheep farmers.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:01:56):**  I have been dairy in the past, but as I got older and slowed down, I've never beefened  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:01):**  sheep.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  We, as a family, have lived in this area for generations, and hope to continue living in  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  this area for generations.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:11):**  We will hear more from Rhys later, but a big thanks to Martin for taking the time to record  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  Rhys, and for Rhys being so honest and willing to let us know what he thinks.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:20):**  It's brilliant to hear the views of an upland sheep farmer.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  This voice is so often missing from the debate.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:27):**  You will also hear from spiritual ecologist and the artist behind the milking parlor,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:31):**  Nessie Reid.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  Here she is telling us a bit about herself.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:36):**  My name is Nessie Reid, and I am creator of the milking parlor, which is an ongoing art  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  project looking at the future of our food system and engaging the public in thinking  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:47):**  about where our food comes from and the politics behind our food.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  And I'm also a fellow at the St. Ethelberger's Spiritual Ecology Fellowship, which is a year-long  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  fellowship looking into how do we apply the principles of spiritual ecology to our work.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:05):**  And so the conversation with Fiona begins.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:08):**  We start with beauty.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:11):**  I don't see beauty as just about aesthetics or the sort of superficial attractiveness of  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:16):**  a place.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:17):**  I see beauty almost as a sense of moral purpose.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:21):**  It's a way of looking at the world, of valuing the things that money can't buy, of recognizing  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:25):**  there's a sort of spiritual connection that we have through valuing the kind of unquantifiable.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:30):**  And I get really nervous when people say, oh, let's make beauty a sort of part of this  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:36):**  exercise or try and corral it in some way.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:39):**  Because for me, it is about values.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  So one of the reasons I'm so passionate about reviving the fight for beauty is I think it  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  gives people a language that they can use when they're not experts.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:50):**  People can feel intimidated by the planning system and having to justify in technical  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:03:53):**  ways why this place is special or basically being challenged by highly paid experts from  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  the developer side that say, you don't know anything.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:05):**  Your voice doesn't matter.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:06):**  And I want to empower people to just speak up for places they love and to be able to  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:10):**  feel they can defend them and to use arguments that are meaningful to them without having  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:15):**  to kind of turn it into an econometric argument or some sort of scientific process.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:20):**  So actually, I've got lots of experiences in my life where local people have tried to  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:26):**  protect places like that and have been stamped on by the process of bureaucracy and economism,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:34):**  which is the word that we use in my book.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  But for myself, I can remember fighting planning applications against quarry developments in  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:44):**  the Peak District National Parks and the Yorkshire Dales National Park and determinedly of using  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:48):**  the arguments for beauty and sometimes winning and sometimes not winning.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:52):**  But I do think it's about empowering people.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:04:55):**  That's why I think the word beauty is so important because as an individual, it's a word that  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:00):**  we use all the time.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  It's just you never hear it used in official language anymore.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:05):**  It's liberating to just use words that we feel comfortable with in everyday life.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:10):**  And I'm trying to sort of in a sense empower people to speak from the heart with confidence  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:17):**  about the vital importance of beautiful places to our general quality of life.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:21):**  I mean, we are at a point in our society where we can't go on getting richer because we're  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:26):**  using natural resources at a high pace.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:29):**  We've diminished the quality of our own natural resource base.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:33):**  We can't just go on seeking material progress.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:36):**  We have to start accepting that a different kind of progress is going to be beneficial  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:41):**  to the planet and beneficial to us if we see it that way.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:44):**  And beauty to me is a way into those arguments, a way of opening our hearts out to a different  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:49):**  kind of future.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  That's really beautiful.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:51):**  I've never heard someone say that that way and reframe what's often sold to us as, well,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:05:57):**  you just are going to have to have a worse life.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  We really love the idea of using the word beauty to empower all people to have a say  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:07):**  in what happens to the landscapes around them.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:11):**  We asked Nessie and Rhys what beauty means to them.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  For me, beauty relates to a state of the heart.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:21):**  When I find something beautiful, I can feel my heart aching and sometimes something can  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:28):**  be almost too beautiful that it aches tremendously.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  When I look at the man I love, sometimes it's painfully beautiful.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  And then I think also beauty is not just about functionality.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  Some functional things can be beautiful, but for me beauty serves a higher purpose than  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:51):**  just a day-to-day living and a day-to-day functionality.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:06:55):**  It's speaking to a place within our hearts and within our souls that that day-to-day  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:01):**  life doesn't necessarily do.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:03):**  We all have an opinion about beauty and what it is.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:07):**  Some people think that it's not necessarily beauty in the eyes of the beholder.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:12):**  For me, it's my family, it's my area.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:16):**  We all have ideas of what beauty is.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:20):**  But the concern, if we take it into a wider perspective, is that while the nation would  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:27):**  feel that they want to protect what is deemed to be beautiful, and maybe in countryside  
**[0:07:32-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:32):**  designations of outstanding natural beauty would be one thing, and the public require  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:41):**  certain elements of beauty to be protected, it is very dangerous for, particularly civil  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:50):**  servants or people who are influenced by various economic and maybe even planning drivers,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:07:58):**  decide what is beautiful and what is not.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:00):**  Beauty is an interesting word, isn't it?  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:03):**  And they're using the Welsh language, it's arddoch, which is not necessarily as a fundamental  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  word as perhaps beauty would be in English.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:13):**  It's more of a general term, and other verbs and adjectives are used to add to it depending  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  on what the context is.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:20):**  At the same time, it's interesting that any discussion concentrate on one word, because  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:27):**  one word is not wide enough very often to describe what you're talking about.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:32):**  And now back to Fiona.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  We pick up the conversation talking about planning and sustainable land use.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:38):**  I do think land is the forgotten resource in this country.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:42):**  I think we've taken it for granted for too long, everyone thinks that there's always  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:45):**  going to be plenty of land, and yet if you look at what we've done, particularly since  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:49):**  the Industrial Revolution, we've squandered land, we've used land too intensively, we  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:54):**  have had a planning system which I'm enormously passionate about, but we have also made some  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:58):**  bad mistakes.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:08:59):**  So to me, if we put land at the centre of our vision for this country, I think we'd  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:05):**  do a better job.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:07):**  How do you think small-scale farmers could start to see some space to access that land  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:14):**  and make a positive contribution to the beauty of the landscape?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:17):**  Well, I think there's basically a big decision that's got to be made about whether land is  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:22):**  used for farming, used for urban development, and of course, there are many other demands  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:28):**  we place on it for infrastructure, for housing and all the rest of it.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  But I think when it comes to rural land, it does seem to me that the kind of old principle  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:36):**  – you aren't making it any more, you need to protect the productivity and the wellbeing  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:42):**  of the land as a fundamental objective of policy – I think is absolutely critical.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  So I would like to see all land that is farmed farmed well in a profoundly sustainable way,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:54):**  but also producing multiple outputs.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:09:56):**  We live in a small country with a big population, we can't afford for land just to have one  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:01):**  function – it's got to deliver for farming, it's got to deliver for nature, it's got  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  to deliver for people's wellbeing, it's got to deliver those wider public goods.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:09):**  So to me, farmers, large or small, actually, have absolutely got a critical role to play  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:14):**  in that.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:16):**  So do you know anyone who's already doing things to reform land use in that way?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:20):**  Well, there are a lot of organisations that are really campaigning now in this new Brexit  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:26):**  world for better land use policies.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, you've got organisations like CPRE, the one I used to work for, who are doing  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:32):**  a great job on land use strategy from a kind of a more planning perspective.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:37):**  There are organisations like the National Trust that own great tracts of land, there  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  are RSPB wildlife trusts, there are lots and lots of organisations.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:44):**  But I'm not quite sure anybody has this really strong focus on sustainable land use as the  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  absolute core of what we should be trying to achieve post Brexit in the new world.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:55):**  Where would you put your energy?  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:56):**  Well, I'd put my energy in two places.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:10:59):**  I'd put it as much in sustainable cities as I would in sustainable countryside, because  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:05):**  you can't do one without the other.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:07):**  We need to make our cities beautiful, sustainable, healthy, good places to live.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:13):**  And we also need to make our rural areas productive, but productive in a sustainable sense.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:18):**  Places where people can also get those wider benefits from, you know, fresh air, enjoyment  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:24):**  of the outdoors, wildlife, all of the things that really matter, but that we have rather  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  lost in the last 50 years or so.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  So I think we've got to have a kind of integrated strategy where both the urban areas and the  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:38):**  rural areas have to work to new objectives.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:41):**  What do you think about the rewilding debate and the idea that often farmers are pitted  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:46):**  against the rewilders?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:49):**  I'm going to start with a bit of context here, because our landscape is essentially a farm  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:54):**  landscape and has been for several thousand years.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:11:59):**  We have in the process massively diminished its natural capital, if you like, particularly  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:06):**  the resource through biodiversity and wildlife.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:08):**  And we've got to get it back, this is for sure.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:11):**  But I think there's a choice between the way that we get it back, either by kind of literally  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:15):**  setting aside and rewilding places, or through a different vision for farming.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:22):**  And my own passionate preference is for a different vision for farming, because that  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:26):**  allows you to, over a huge area, do things better.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:31):**  Now that doesn't mean there aren't places where nature would take precedence, but I  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:35):**  worry that the rewilding debate does absolutely divide people into two camps who say, you  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:41):**  know, you can't do farming and wildlife together, you have to either do wildlife over here and  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:46):**  farming over there, or kind of accept that somehow you've got a kind of unbridgeable  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:50):**  chasm.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  And I think that rewilding will have a place, of course, but a much more important debate  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:12:56):**  is how to make farming much better for wildlife, so that the majority of our countryside can  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:02):**  be farmed sustainably.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:04):**  We don't have the luxury in this country of huge expanses of land that aren't near where  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:09):**  anybody lives, as they do in some of the bigger continents or whatever.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:13):**  We certainly, I think we do have a place for beavers in this country without question.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  And what you're talking about is a gradation, you know, there will be some areas that are  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:20):**  still, you know, where production is the main purpose, the majority purpose, and there will  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  be others on a sort of sliding scale where nature is much more dominant.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:30):**  And I think the hills and uplands are places where, you know, nature would take a much,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:35):**  much stronger role, partly because the economics of what we produce for food there is very  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:40):**  questionable and highly influenced by the old CAP, which we're not going to have anymore,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  so we can choose to make all that much, much better for nature.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:48):**  So I'm not so worried about the kind of internal tensions between beavers and trees and all  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:53):**  the rest of it, because actually I think it's much more important we have a look at how,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:13:57):**  you know, we get that much bigger picture view of, particularly in our hills and uplands,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:05):**  of much less intensive farming within which there will be places for beavers, but there  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:11):**  will still be, I bet, and rightly so, some production going on.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah, because I know some upland sheep farmers, and they're the people who are the most angry  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:20):**  about the rewilding debate, because they're often sectioned off as like the least productive,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:26):**  so they're the first to go.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  So what would you say to them?  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:30):**  Well, I've been working with hill farmers all my life.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:32):**  My grandfather was a hill farmer, and I'm a really passionate advocate for hill farmers,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:37):**  because I also believe that we have a cultural landscape.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:41):**  You know, this is an landscape made by and for and with people, and it's not something  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:46):**  that you can just sort of sweep aside centuries of a really important part of our culture.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:53):**  Farming in the uplands will change, of course, because it is an artificial construct, but  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:57):**  it should not be without people.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  It should not be without sheep.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:01):**  I have to say, I love sheep.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:05):**  We have got too many of them at the moment, but I love sheep, and I think they're part  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:08):**  of our history and our future.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:12):**  So I think it's this question about degradation, about saying in some places that, you know,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:17):**  sheep farming will be much less economic, but it shouldn't go.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:20):**  And much of the Lake District, for example, you know, I would passionately defend hill  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:24):**  farming in the Lake District, but it'd probably be less intense.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:27):**  It would be structured and supported in a different way, and it would produce other  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:31):**  benefits alongside it.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:33):**  It's great to hear Fiona sees the value in upland hill farmers, but not everyone does.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:38):**  Martin asked Rhys about the life of an upland sheep farmer and what he felt about the rewilding  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:43):**  debate.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:45):**  What would you say is unique about upland sheep farmers?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:48):**  That's a good question, I think.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:49):**  I don't know that unique is not a word I would use because people are the same, farmers are  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:15:55):**  the same, plumbers are the same, the world over in the sense, in the general sense.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:00):**  I think probably upland farmers have to live in isolation very often, or communities are  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:07):**  fairly isolated communities, and therefore they create their own communities and their  
**[0:16:12-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:12):**  own, the driving force is to live with nature and communicate with the outside world when  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:20):**  they need to and when they want to.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:22):**  So it's a little bit of that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:24):**  It's not isolation, unless it's by choice.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:28):**  It's just the environment they live in, really.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:29):**  So I suppose that's not necessarily unique, but it's singularly a requirement if you're  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:36):**  an upland farmer, you have to adapt to that way of life.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:41):**  We understand what the very seasons and the various moods of the weather will have its  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:47):**  effect on us, really.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  So we have to be very aware of how those things work.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:51):**  What do you think about the idea of rewilding parts of Britain?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:56):**  Maybe what does rewilding mean to you?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:00):**  I've struggled with that.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:03):**  My first reaction, I probably still believe it, is that it's an idea certain people have  
**[0:17:10-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:10):**  expounded as a marquee idea that they suddenly dreamt in the middle of the night.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  The thing about rewilding, as I understand it, and I don't pretend to understand how  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:23):**  George Mombio thought processes work, ignores a lot of reality.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:30):**  We're all very, very concerned about conservation and protecting our environment.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:36):**  Nobody I believe has the right to think that they have the monopoly on good ideas or wisdom.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:43):**  In the case of rewilding, as I was saying, I think they are ignoring some realities.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:49):**  By rewilding, we reintroduce species that are not necessarily endangered because they  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:55):**  exist in Europe.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  It's not a problem for the genetics and that side of it.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  It's some idea that the whole structure of the upland areas, particularly, maybe other  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:07):**  areas as well, can be changed to some prehistoric scenario.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:13):**  I really do think that people who think about rewilding in terms of bringing in species  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:20):**  that perhaps weren't here before, and sadly the dodo is not one of the options that they  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:24):**  can do unless the scientists can work some miracle, should concentrate on the endangered  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:29):**  species that already have a problem in Britain.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:33):**  I think by working together, the upland farmer, the lowland farmer, conservationist, those  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:40):**  so-called intellectuals could do far more good for their environment and have these  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:44):**  marquee ideas that mean nothing in reality.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:48):**  Point is, it's an endanger to the people who live in those communities.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  Do you really want to lose the people that live in these communities?  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:57):**  Because that is the risk that you take.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:18:59):**  Removing what Mr. Monbiot calls the white maggots of sheep, doesn't do anything necessarily  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:05):**  to sheep because they'll go somewhere else, they'll be kept somewhere else, but it will  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:08):**  remove the communities.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:11):**  And I don't think we can afford to lose those.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:13):**  That pool of expertise and great interest in the countryside that people living in upland  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:20):**  communities have.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:22):**  The resource that we have in the upland areas, we can talk at length about air and water,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:28):**  clean air, clean water, all these things, carbon sink, they're all very, very important  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  and we need to preserve them and nurture them as best we can.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:39):**  But I really do think that one of those primary elements is food as well, and the production  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:44):**  of food for the community.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  And this is what the upland area does that some people would think, well let the lowland  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  areas do that and we can have the upland areas catering for some other need that community  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:55):**  has, community benefit.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:19:57):**  But community benefits from, nobody in the lowlands will keep the sheep for instance  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:02):**  that the nation would require.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:05):**  You'd have to import them from denuded areas of Australia or New Zealand in the end that  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:12):**  don't have the same principles perhaps sometimes that we would have, especially if there is  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  care taken.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:18):**  Yes, again it's difficult for me not to...  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:20):**  You be quiet Martin, you just ask the questions.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  Yeah, no it's really good.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:25):**  What would be lost would be the people.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  What would be gained would be, it depends how, rewilding or ecological rebalancing,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  how it would be played.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:38):**  But what I fear is people who don't really understand these areas and the need to be  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:46):**  in control.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  So what would be lost is people with proper understanding of what's needed.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:20:52):**  It really does worry me that you hear statements from politicians and groupings of so-called  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:00):**  charities who say, oh well let the lowlands produce the food and the uplands do something  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:05):**  else.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  That is so insulting to the intelligence of those people who live in the various areas.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:13):**  It's a patchwork, it's a mosaic.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:16):**  How anybody could be so simplistic as to talk in those terms is very worrying.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:22):**  Nessie also had a few thoughts on what rewilding means to her.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:26):**  Something quite different altogether.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  When we talk about rewilding it's not just a rewilding of our natural landscapes, it's  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:32):**  a rewilding of ourselves, of that beauty.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:35):**  And I think it's a stripping from a Buddhist perspective, which is what I come from.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:40):**  How do we strip away the incessant, endless, nagging noise of the mind?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:44):**  And how do we rewild and repopulate our mind with much bigger, much more important stories?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  And I think when we look at things like cosmology and our bigger place in the human history,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:21:56):**  we need to think about what kind of mark are we going to leave behind and what do we stand  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:00):**  for?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:01):**  And I want that to be a beautiful one.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:03):**  I want the architecture to be beautiful.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  I want our science to be beautiful.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:07):**  And I suppose when I say beautiful, I mean ultimately serving the greater good of humanity.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:13):**  So going back to rewilding, I think it's really about how do we rewild ourselves, but also  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:18):**  how do we live in landscapes where it's not just completely anthracentric, where it becomes  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:23):**  more biocentric, where nature is valued and revered and respected, rather than man always  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:30):**  having to have such great dominion.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:35):**  And finally, back to Fiona for her thoughts on putting all this into policy and practice.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:43):**  An ideal vision would be where we valued all the products from the land and found a kind  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:49):**  of harmony between them.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:51):**  So of course we're going to produce food.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  We need to produce food, but we also have a crisis in nature.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:22:57):**  We also have major human benefits that we need from land.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  We also have things that we didn't understand 20 or 30 years ago, like protection against  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:06):**  flooding and those other sort of wider land uses.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  And we have a much stronger need to protect our soil and the integrity of our soil.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  I think for me it isn't about being prescriptive, but it is about having an ambition for harmony,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:21):**  for making decisions at a relatively local level that are based on the particular qualities  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  and characteristics of that area, but which also try to balance off, if you like, the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:35):**  best way of delivering multiple outputs from the land.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:38):**  I'm sure you read the CPRE report and their new model farming section.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:43):**  What did you think of that?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:44):**  I think there are loads of ideas in that that I would completely agree with, actually.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:48):**  But it won't be, you know, nobody will just pick that up and implement it.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:51):**  I think what we're looking for out of this change is we're looking for a simpler farm  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:57):**  policy.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:23:58):**  You know, the common agricultural policy is fraught with bureaucracy and complications.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  I think we're looking for some high-level principles that are about multiple objectives,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  about sustainability, about soil protection, about nature's revival, about public benefit.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:15):**  But we're also looking, I think, for more delegated responsibility to local level where  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  the detail of what incentives are given and what encouragement are given to farmers is  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:26):**  attuned to the character and the need of particular areas.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:30):**  We don't try and prescribe it all from the centre, but we do recognise that there is  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:36):**  diversity in our landscape and we need to reflect that in policy.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  What would you say to farmers going forward about subsidies?  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:42):**  Well, I haven't got a new one in my pocket, but I do think that we do need to support  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:49):**  sustainable farming in this country.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:51):**  I don't think it would survive in a free market environment.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:55):**  And actually, some of the lessons we've learned of the past, and you know, my book charts  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:24:59):**  painfully all the fights we had.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:03):**  In fact, we have learned some very good skills about how to support environmentally responsible  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:09):**  farming through initially the ESA process, through country-centred stewardship, through  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:13):**  all of these pillar two kind of payments.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  And I don't think we should throw that knowledge away.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:18):**  We should remember, you know, where we've come from.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:22):**  So I think we do need some high-level principles which everybody, every farmer has to accede  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:27):**  to.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:28):**  You can't trash the soil, you can't fundamentally, you know, damage nature, and you do need to  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:35):**  produce food in a sustainable way.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:37):**  But then I think there will be subsidies available for particular benefits delivered.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:44):**  And some of that may be for certain food crops.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:47):**  Still, there may well be a case, more vegetables actually, we've never subsidised vegetables,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:51):**  maybe because of the questions of diet and all the rest of it, we'll need to do that.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:56):**  Those are discussions we need to have, but I think more importantly it will be clear  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:25:59):**  that there will be certain public benefits that won't be delivered unless they're subsidised.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:05):**  And that's where, you know, the work's going on about wildlife landscape, heritage,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:10):**  flood protection, soil conservation, you know, those things will all be, I think, necessarily  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:16):**  supported under a new system.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:18):**  Farming is inherently a very risky business and for very little reward economically, generally.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:24):**  So a lot of farmers would say, oh, it's all very well talking about beauty and nature,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:29):**  but you know, our livelihood's on the line, so of course I'll spray the chemicals or I'll  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:36):**  add the nitrogen or I'll cut down the trees.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:40):**  What's the retort to that?  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:41):**  I think it depends entirely on what you're trying to produce.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:44):**  I mean, if you're trying to produce food as cheaply as possible with very low environmental  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:49):**  standards to meet a trade deal with, say, America, for the sake of argument, then of  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  course that's how, you know, that's how the picture will look.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:57):**  But you know what?  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:26:58):**  In the UK we could have a much better vision than that.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:01):**  We could have a vision to be a clean, green country that has high standards of production,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  high standards of animal welfare, high standards of, you know, industrial policy, and that  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:10):**  our exports are, if you like, the best in the world.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:14):**  But then if our subsidy system and our regulatory system was designed to sustain that, actually  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:20):**  that would frame the economic, you know, proposition that farmers would buy into, and they wouldn't  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:25):**  be therefore just trying to, you know, drive to the bottom and drive for the cheapest outcome,  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:30):**  because actually the system would be constructed around something that was high quality, good  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:35):**  for the environment, and good for, you know, the broader sort of reputation of the UK.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:40):**  So I think it depends entirely on how we construct the vision.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  I fear the race for the bottom.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:47):**  I think many people do.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:49):**  But actually we have a choice.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:50):**  We could do it completely the other way, and that would give farmers for the first time  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:54):**  a sense that they were entirely in tune, if you like, with what the nation wanted from  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  them and not somehow fighting against it.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:01):**  Actually farmers also say, we are conservationists in our blood, and I think we should take that  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:07):**  at face value and design a system that plays to that desire.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:12):**  Farmers say they have to be stewards, to be farming in a way that's good for the future,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:17):**  as well as good for today.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:19):**  And you know, that's a challenge I think, to design a system that genuinely supports  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:23):**  that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:24):**  But then one other side to that debate is like, how do we produce food for people who,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:28):**  you know, have low incomes?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:30):**  Where do they fit into that picture?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:31):**  Well, I think that's where, again, it's this question about integration.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:35):**  At the moment, our social policies don't really have much to say about food and diets, don't  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:42):**  have much to say about healthy eating, about, you know, well-being.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:45):**  But it's entirely possible to design a system which says that, you know, as part of the  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:50):**  sort of social subsidy network, for people in genuine need, there is hope for people  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:28:54):**  to have access to healthy food and to be supported to, whether it's grow their own, which isn't  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:01):**  practical everybody, but cook from ingredients rather than buying prepackaged food.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:06):**  You know, there are things we could do.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:08):**  There's a whole raft of ambitions for the education system about teaching children to  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:12):**  grow, teaching children to appreciate food, teaching children to enjoy eating vegetables  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:17):**  and, you know, actually know what a healthy diet is.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:20):**  So, again, it's about joining up and having a much more connected vision rather than saying,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:26):**  oh, dear, people can't afford expensive packaged food, which is true.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:30):**  And I think this is why, you know, the Brexit debate, which is quite divisive and quite  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:35):**  difficult, you know, has to be a moment where we ask ourselves some really fundamental questions  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:40):**  about the direction we're going and what we want.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:42):**  And if all we do is go for the cheapest possible production of food, you know, rock bottom  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:47):**  standards, we'll pay for it in one way or another.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:51):**  If in the other hand we say, no, this is a moment where we can right some of the past  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:29:56):**  wrongs, put together a package which is much more sustainable, much better for society  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:00):**  as a whole, restores our wildlife, but produces food in a sustainable way, then that's the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:06):**  prize I think that we should aim for.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:08):**  And I genuinely think that beauty as an argument helps to create that positive vision.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:14):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:15):**  Well, I wouldn't say that, but, yes, thank you.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:22):**  Give me the chance to say a few things.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:23):**  I hope it's rational because I don't want well sound, you know, fundamentalist one way  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:29):**  or the other.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:34):**  So there you have it.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:35):**  A spiritual ecologist, a long time institution leader and policy advisor, and a lifelong  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:41):**  farmer with a range of perspectives on beauty and rewilding.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:46):**  We hope you've found Fiona's fight for beauty a voice you want to support.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:52):**  I find it interesting that we're hearing more of these softer words such as harmony and  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:30:56):**  beauty in a farming context.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:00):**  I understand Reese's concern of who decides what beauty is, but I think that ultimately  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:06):**  Fiona has shown that throughout history the word can actually be a support to Reese and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:12):**  upland farmers like him.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:15):**  Beauty is a unifier.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:17):**  It's a cause that everyone in the community can identify with and fight for.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:23):**  Whether you're convinced about beauty or not, it seems one thing is clear.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:28):**  Neither Fiona nor Nessie nor Reese believe that it's a good idea to let productivity  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:34):**  be the main thing which shapes our landscape.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama#t=0:31:39):**  Thank you for listening and thank you to all our guests and to Joe and Katie who worked

## 44: Radical roots, Slow Money, CSAs and Allies.  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:09):**  This month we explore radical roots and cider apples with a farming couple in Oregon.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:15):**  We hear about a different type of investment, the slow money movement.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:20):**  We talk to CSAs in Northern Ireland and we end with a call for allyship in the kitchen  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:26):**  from a passionate chef.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:33):**  Kim Hamblin and Dan Rinke live down a little track in rural Oregon where they have a beautiful  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:38):**  experimental farm, Rochambeau Art Farm.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:41):**  The duo have a deep understanding of what it means to be regenerative farmers and are  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:46):**  crafting a farming landscape that's focused on resilience.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:50):**  They have a cider and wine label called Art & Science, which is currently made from wild  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:00:56):**  foraged apples and fruits, but they've started planting apple trees from seedlings on their  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:00):**  40 acres, as well as many other trees.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:04):**  Here's Dan and Kim talking to us through seedlings, roots and resilience.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:10):**  Hi, I'm Kim Hamblin and I am co-owner with Dan Rinke of Art & Science Cider and Wine.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:21):**  We have a farm, about 50 acres, and it's kind of a mixed-use farm.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:25):**  We do a music fest annually, so I like to have a lot of fun doing different things.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:30):**  Hi, I'm Dan Rinke and I am the other co-owner of Rochambeau Art Farm.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:35):**  We are in, or just between Sheridan and Willamina, Oregon.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:40):**  In our rootstock orchard, it's about a four and a half acre orchard, we have 70 different  
**[0:01:47-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:47):**  apple varieties, a little bit over 20 different pear varieties, and just over a dozen quince  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:56):**  varieties.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:01:58):**  In between each of those varieties, we planted a non-malus, non-cydonia, non-pirus species,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:07):**  and that could be anything from black locust to honey locust to ash, an alder, maple, willow,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:20):**  elderberry, hazelnuts, just a very vast, diverse selection of plants.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:28):**  As far as the potential negative aspects of this would be, harvesting is going to be a  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:35):**  pain in the butt.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:36):**  There's a lot of different varieties and a lot of different things going on out there.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:40):**  It's not as easy as a regular monoculture cropping situation like the rest of the country  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:48):**  does, but as far as I see it, I think it's going to create more resilient plants and  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:02:55):**  more interconnectedness within the plant and microbiological communities, creating more  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:03):**  resilient and potentially healthier plants.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:08):**  It should create a more expansive hyphal network between plants and allow the different plants  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:20):**  to potentially pass nutrients and water and hormones from plant to plant, which could  
**[0:03:27-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:27):**  help with just the overall health of the plant and also their disease and insect resistances.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:36):**  One of the main things that I'm looking at is creating a very healthy soil microbial  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:44):**  food web and a vast system of mycelium.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:50):**  Within the mycelium and the mycorrhizae that grow in the soil and on the plants, there  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:03:54):**  are specific species that have two associations with mycorrhizae, the two different mycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:02):**  There's the endomycorrhizae and the ectomycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:06):**  Species like Aldaberry and Willow have both associations to both mycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:14):**  I think it's really important to have these hub-like species out there to bridge the gaps  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:21):**  between the two different types of mycorrhizae.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:26):**  The seedling orchard, we just planted this last fall, so in 2018, and it's about 10 acres.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:37):**  The grid is a 60 by 60 spacing on the apples.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:40):**  It's mostly apples, a little bit of pears.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:43):**  The reason we did it was because we wanted to have more resilient trees.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:49):**  Seedling trees tend to tap root down, so most of them are apples and they form a natural  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:55):**  trap.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:56):**  You plant the seed and it just keeps going.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:04:58):**  Dan, would you like to talk about the radical?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:01):**  The primary radical of the seedling.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:05):**  As a seed germinates, it creates one primary radical, which then becomes the tap root.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:12):**  That goes straight down and becomes the main root of the tree.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:18):**  The difference is that normally apple trees are grown on rootstocks.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:23):**  The rootstocks come from a stick cutting, so then all the roots come from the periphery  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:30):**  of the edge of the stick.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:32):**  There's no one main radical.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:35):**  One of those roots may become a little bit more dominant than the others, but it's not  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:40):**  one single root.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:42):**  There was a seedling over by the front porch.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:45):**  We used to do all our processing on the patio illegally.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:51):**  Some of the mash would wash off when we washed the patio.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:56):**  Some seeds just planted themselves.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:05:58):**  Most of the time we just dug them up or they'd wither away after some neglect.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:03):**  This one tree would not die.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:06):**  I kept running it over with a hose back and forth.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:08):**  It was right in the middle of a corner between two patios, so it was in this really weird  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:13):**  spot.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:14):**  It just kept living.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:16):**  I just let it go because I was like, well, you want to live.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:18):**  I'm going to let it go.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:20):**  I just dug it up and it was probably about four feet tall.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:23):**  I dug as far as I could and then I just snapped off the tap.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:29):**  It was damn near the size of the tree, and I think it probably was if I kept going.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:34):**  It really had one main tap and then some secondary ones coming off.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:38):**  It was really interesting to see how that one looked versus some of my potted ones.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:44):**  I also have a little nursery where we potted up some of the compost pile, some of the seedlings  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:50):**  just popped up in the compost.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:51):**  I dug them up and put them in a pot and kept them.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:56):**  We had some root stock ones that we grafted.  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:58):**  I looked at those two side by side.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:06:59):**  I opened them up and shook off the roots just to see what the differences were.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:03):**  It was really interesting because the seedling ones, even though some of them were only a  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:07):**  year old, had tapped through the pot and went in through the cloth underneath and down into  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:14):**  the ground.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:16):**  They really wanted to get in the damn ground.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:18):**  So it's like, all right, you want to live.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:20):**  I appreciate that resiliency.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:22):**  So that's kind of what we want for future cider production and future climate change  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:27):**  and all the good stuff.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:30):**  Climate change forecast has shown that the Pacific Northwest is just going to get hotter  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:34):**  and drier.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:36):**  Currently we don't have water rights, and so we don't really have the ability to irrigate  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:42):**  our crop.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:43):**  And this will help circumnavigate, get over that problem by just having a deeper taproot  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:52):**  and more resilient trees that can live through droughts.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:07:56):**  The other thing I have to say about propagating an orchard by seed is we're also helping change  
**[0:08:05-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:05):**  the genetic makeup and the diversity of the plants by allowing some genetic changes.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:15):**  The way apples and grapes and most of our agricultural perennial crops are grown nowadays  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:21):**  is that they're taken from clonal selection.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:24):**  So there's no way for evolution to happen, where if you're taking it from seed, you're  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:30):**  allowing more evolution or the chance of evolution to happen and possibly overcoming some of  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:36):**  the disease issues that we deal with in modern farming.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:40):**  And then also on that same note is making a true American species of apple, because  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:45):**  right now most of the cider industry is copying the English or the French.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:49):**  So they're importing these same varieties that they grow in other countries across the  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:54):**  world and planting them in America and like, oh, we make cider now, you know, instead of  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:08:59):**  like we actually have American cider varieties and it's endless how many we can have.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:04):**  So it's actually kind of fun to be part of that movement too of like, this is going to  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:09):**  be future cider in 10 years.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:11):**  I think the one easy thing is to keep in mind that with diversity comes resilience.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:19):**  I never really considered, I don't know why, but the idea that clones were sort of evading  
**[0:09:27-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:27):**  evolutionary, or evading evolution and not allowing seeds or seed or lines of genetics  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:38):**  to evolve.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:40):**  And I think that actually that, you know, when Dan and Kim pointed that out to me, it  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:45):**  really made me think hard about the importance of what they're doing in terms of, you know,  
**[0:09:51-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:09:51):**  planting seedlings, okay, it may not be as quick and easy to get those trees to start,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:01):**  but actually if we just keep using clones in all of our, and specific rootstocks in  
**[0:10:08-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:08):**  all of our trees that we're planting, that is actually setting us up for potential large  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:17):**  scale failure because everything's got the same makeup.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:23):**  So it's the opposite of diversity and yeah, so it was really interesting they pointed  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:27):**  that out and I'd love to hear about more people who are working in that way.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:34):**  Woody Tash is the most bright-eyed, socially and environmentally responsible financier  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:39):**  we've ever met.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:41):**  He worked for over 30 years in finance, managing other people's money, but 10 years ago he  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:46):**  took a radical step and started the Slow Money movement.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:51):**  Now if you look at the numbers, Slow Money walks a fine line between philanthropy and  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:57):**  investment.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:10:58):**  But the whole point of Slow Money is that the return on an investment is the regeneration  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:03):**  of the soil and ultimately the health of the local community and planet.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:10):**  That is what people are investing in.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:12):**  Financially, they want to have their loan paid back if possible, although that doesn't  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:17):**  always happen.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:19):**  But the gain or the return is regenerated soils and healthy community.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:26):**  This is pretty radical and it can take some time to get your head around.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:34):**  This is not about numbers, doing these numbers versus doing those numbers.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:39):**  This is about reaffirming the primacy of words over the claims on our attention made by numbers.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:46):**  Reaffirming the primacy of relationships over the claims of transactions.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:52):**  Reaffirming the primacy of nutrition over the claims of cheap calories.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:11:58):**  Reaffirming the primacy of places over the claims of markets.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:04):**  Reaffirming the primacy of generations and seasons over the claims of milliseconds and  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:09):**  algorithms.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:10):**  Reaffirming the primacy of putting back in over the claims of taking out.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:16):**  What is Slow Money?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:18):**  Slow Money is a shared vision of the importance of, and I'll say several things nested together,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:28):**  thinking very long term, being patient.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:32):**  The patience leads to the idea of slow.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:35):**  Thinking more about preserving and restoring soil fertility than about extracting financial  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:43):**  returns.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:44):**  But all of those things, the conversation about all those things is something that's  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:48):**  turned into the Slow Money movement.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:50):**  And then from that conversation, a network of networks, if you will, a bunch of small  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:53):**  local groups sprouted up, mostly in the West, few in Canada, a little bit in France, a tiny  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:12:58):**  bit now in Australia, where groups of people who have been participating in this conversation,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:05):**  you could call it sharing a vision, you could call it participating in an active conversation  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:10):**  trying to help one another move in a radical new direction.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:13):**  Those conversations and that network has led to the flow of $70 million into almost 700  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:19):**  small food enterprises, everything from individual organic farms to food processing, distribution,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:26):**  restaurants, slaughterhouses, cheese makers, seed companies, anything that is helping get  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:31):**  local organic produce from the producer into the local market.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:34):**  So it's very local, small dots, groups of people collaborating together actively to  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:39):**  help one another do that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:41):**  From a financial standpoint, a little bit you could say that Slow Money is staking out  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:44):**  territory between investing and philanthropy.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:47):**  So the first 0% loan that our new group in Boulder gave was to a farm and restaurant  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:13:54):**  in Boulder where the farm family has dedicated themselves to growing as much as possible  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:00):**  that they serve in the restaurant from their own farm.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:02):**  And they were farming 200 acres and they just leased another 200 acres and they had no walk-in  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:07):**  cooler on the second farm.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:09):**  They only had the cooler in the restaurant.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:11):**  So we lent them $12,000 so they could have a walk-in cooler on the second farm.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:16):**  So very fairly straightforward, I guess you'd say.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:19):**  There are lots of other examples that are on slowmoney.org.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:21):**  I mean, there are hundreds of things like lending $5,000 for a hoop house or a few thousand  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:27):**  dollars for drip irrigation line, things like that.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:31):**  Gradually moving up to like buying a used tractor or a refrigerated truck or things  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:34):**  like that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:35):**  A very smart person in a recent public conversation talked about investing yourself versus investing  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:42):**  money and that's a big part of it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:45):**  It's what does it mean to invest?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:47):**  If investing means just giving your money to some stranger so they can grow the money  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:52):**  arithmetically, that's one kind of investing.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:53):**  If investing means taking time and energy and committing yourself to something because  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:14:56):**  it's a cause you believe in, that's a different kind of investing.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:01):**  The consumer part is obvious.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:02):**  That's Slow Food and a whole bunch of other people who are mobilizing consumers to intentionally  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:07):**  drive their consumer dollars.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:08):**  So we're kind of coming up fast, coming up slowly with the investor part, saying we've  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:15):**  got to bring our investor dollars there.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:17):**  I'm not going to say it's more fundamental but it's as fundamentally important because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:21):**  if we buy all of our food from a CSA or a farmer's market but our money is invested  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:25):**  in the industrial system, we're certainly compromising deeply that which we're trying  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:29):**  to do.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:30):**  From my experience in Slow Money to date, I am convinced there are many millions of  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:33):**  people, how many?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:35):**  It's hard to say, but many millions of people who really want something like this to happen.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:39):**  They want to reconnect.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:41):**  They want to bring their money back down to earth.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:43):**  They want to fully value things in the earth and in their community.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:48):**  And it's hard at the beginning.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:49):**  I mean, we're just at the beginning.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:50):**  It's hard, but I think this is a generational shift.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:54):**  So we all just have to keep at it.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:15:57):**  If you want to know more about this form of investment and the people who support and  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:01):**  benefit from it, we'll be releasing a full-length interview with Woody as a short later this  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:06):**  week.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:08):**  So check our feed for that.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:10):**  We're keen to support Slow Money efforts.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:12):**  So is there anyone out there who wants to start up a Slow Money group where you are?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:16):**  Let us know and we can put you in touch with Woody and the team.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:27):**  Now we're back to Jubilee Farm where Johnny is reporting from their recent CSA Ambassadors  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:32):**  event with the UK and Ireland CSA Networks.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:38):**  We're here at Jubilee Farm this month hosting an event called Across Borders, which is organized  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:44):**  by the CSA UK Network and the CSA Network of Ireland, a joint event looking at the potential  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:51):**  of the community-supported agriculture model for farming in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:16:56):**  I'm joined by Marissa from the UK Network and Roisin from the Ireland Network.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:03):**  And together we're going to think a little bit about the potential of CSA for agriculture  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:08):**  here.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:09):**  So Marissa, why the CSA model for farming and for food in Northern Ireland?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:14):**  So we wanted to do this event because we obviously cover the whole of the UK and thus far CSA  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:25):**  hasn't developed as much in Northern Ireland as it has in other areas.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:30):**  So we have quite a lot of CSAs in Wales, they're starting to grow in Scotland.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:34):**  We've had quite a few in England for a while.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:38):**  So it's a model we want to bring to Northern Ireland.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:42):**  We're starting to get a lot of inquiries from Northern Ireland.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:46):**  The model is basically where the consumers share the risks and rewards of farming with  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:53):**  the producer.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:17:54):**  So for small-scale farmers, it's a way for farming to be more viable because they have  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:01):**  a customer base, a reliable customer base.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:05):**  And for consumers, the benefits are getting fresh local produce, learning about farming  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:12):**  and sustainability, and also the benefits of, you know, social benefits of being part  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:18):**  of a community, volunteering, going down to the farm.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:22):**  So we think that's beneficial for farms here as well as everywhere else in the UK.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:29):**  As far as you know, Jubilee Farm is the first community-supported agriculture scheme in  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:33):**  Northern Ireland.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:34):**  As you mentioned, Marasa, we're hoping that there'll be lots more.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:38):**  And Northern Ireland obviously has a troubled history and yet we're here today to have the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:47):**  message that CSAs work across borders.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:50):**  So Roisin, particularly at this time with lots of political and economic turbulence  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:18:56):**  and events, particularly difficult for Northern Ireland caught in the middle and for food  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:00):**  and farming too, why is it so important to have a CSA cross-border event at this time?  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:06):**  I told myself this morning I wouldn't use the word Brexit today.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:11):**  CSA beyond borders is not just about beyond the border, you know, whether hard or soft  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:18):**  or whatever it is on the island of Ireland, but across the world.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:22):**  And this, Marasa and I met in Thessaloniki at a community-supported agriculture international  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:27):**  event organised by Roisin and it was there that we plotted the idea to have this event.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:33):**  And my mother last week went to a CSA in Germany next to where my brother lives in Germany  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:39):**  and the welcome that she received there and the on-the-ground effort to provide food,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:44):**  to live in a community where people have real relationships based on trust, on resilience  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:52):**  and that kind of thing.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:53):**  And we experienced it last night, staying with Jenny and her hospitality and meeting  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:57):**  you this morning.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:19:58):**  And we know it from other CSAs that we've visited, be it in Ireland, be it in the UK,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:03):**  be it in Scotland, it doesn't matter what the names of the places are, the people are  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:06):**  always the same.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:07):**  Let's hope that Jubilee Farm is only the first of many CSAs in Northern Ireland.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:16):**  Good luck.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:18):**  You're off to a great start.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:19):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:41):**  Thanks to Rebel Kitchen for supporting this episode.

**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:53):**  to the planet.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:20:54):**  It's through this commitment that they're helping to support us to continue to share  
**[0:21:00-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:00):**  knowledge in the farming community and spread the word to many more farmers and growers.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:21):**  Brenda Ruiz is a chef and food educator from Sacramento, California.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:26):**  She spoke to us last autumn at Terra Madre in Turin, where she represented Slow Food  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:31):**  USA, and she took her son Alex along with her.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:35):**  We were struck by her dedication to allyship and collaboration, and her words really hit  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:40):**  home about the importance of speaking out and looking out for others in our working  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:44):**  environment.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:46):**  She reminds us that good restaurants and farms are about food sourced with integrity, and  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:51):**  that goes hand in hand with treating people with integrity.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:55):**  Who are you an ally for?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:21:57):**  And who are your allies?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:00):**  Can you build up more of a culture of allyship where you work?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:04):**  My name is Brenda Ruiz.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:05):**  I'm a chef in Sacramento, California.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:08):**  I do cooking and nutrition education with K through 12 youth, paired with school district  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:16):**  programs and after school district programs.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:19):**  And that was after being in a professional kitchen, different restaurants in Sacramento,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:25):**  for over 20 years.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:28):**  When my son was born, I knew I needed to consider transitioning that skill set to a schedule  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:35):**  that was more in line with what was going to be soon his school schedule.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:42):**  Terra Madre has been an amazing experience so far, and I'm blessed to be able to share  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:46):**  it this time around with my nine-year-old son, Alex.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:50):**  When Terra Madre was being planned and scheduled, he expressed an interest in continuing to  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:22:57):**  attend these global gatherings, and so it's just cool to keep it going and to share this  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:03):**  with him.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:04):**  The panel that we attended today was so excellent, and my question to the panelists was really  
**[0:23:09-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:09):**  around the importance of allyships and having allies and not only being a good ally to other  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:19):**  colleagues but also being good at receiving and asking help.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:24):**  I think one of the panelists answered the question as an exchange of skills.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:29):**  So it's not really asking for help and receiving help or working together on something because  
**[0:23:36-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:36):**  maybe the object is heavy to lift or there's a—as women are traditional, bear the roles  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:45):**  of raising family, might need to leave a shift early or have an extra shift pick up.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:23:52):**  That if we have ways of supporting allyships, that creates a healthier restaurant structure.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:01):**  And so I've been really lucky to work in places where those allyships were intentional and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:10):**  sometimes even nuanced, but it always came from the leadership.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:16):**  And whenever I've had times when I didn't feel supported, it was when allyships were  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:24):**  not something that was part of the culture of that kitchen.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:28):**  So I guess the point is that until we have equity, not just equality, but until we have  
**[0:24:37-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:37):**  equity for women in the workplace, that these types of collaborative and allyship approach  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:47):**  I think is really helpful for women to be able to succeed in their careers.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:53):**  And I've been blessed to enjoy colleagues that have provided me that support and allyship  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:24:59):**  where I didn't feel like I was being coddled or helped out for being weak.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:05):**  It was really collaborative.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:08):**  And I think that can translate to other professions as well.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:13):**  As we've seen in the news of the Me Too movement of the last few years, that it's not just  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:17):**  enough to march a couple of times a year, but they're everyday examples of being allies  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:24):**  with each other, women to women, or in between men and women.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:29):**  Or men to men, if someone is being unkind or not being very supportive of a colleague  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:39):**  that's female, that the other colleagues step out and say, come on now, that was not cool,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:46):**  man.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:47):**  That was not cool.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:48):**  I'm not going to let that happen again.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:50):**  So I think I may am using that word allyship or allies, but it is part of a culture of  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:25:58):**  being, approaching getting through the nightly service as a collaboration.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:06):**  Not this like each to himself, because sometimes you do feel it's a very much like a battle  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:12):**  that's about to happen.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:13):**  So you get ready, battle station ready, because it's almost 530, so you know that we're going  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:20):**  to be very busy.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:22):**  But that we always keep in mind that it's a collaboration, we all have the common goal.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:28):**  Just that little shift can help a little bit.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:30):**  One thing that I do a lot and received a lot in the kitchen was I'm a Spanish speaker.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:41):**  I'm a native Spanish speaker in a lot of restaurants in the United States.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:44):**  The prep crew, the chefs that prepare the food for the fancy chefs that cook the line  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:52):**  are Spanish speakers.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:26:53):**  So I was often asked to play a role, a translating role, either between management or between  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:01):**  colleagues.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:02):**  I felt I could be a good ally to my Spanish speaking colleagues and as well as on occasion  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:11):**  also be a good advocate if there was something that was being discussed that was a sensitive  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:16):**  nature.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:17):**  I could help my Hispanic or Latino colleague in their conversation with the management  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:27):**  or another colleague.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:28):**  Like no, we've got to say it this way because this is the way we're going to get through  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:33):**  this conversation.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:36):**  And there's many examples of that type.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:42):**  So yeah, I felt it was a responsibility sometimes to bear that, but it's something I do and  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:53):**  did with a lot of pride.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:27:56):**  And so I'd like to see restaurants really be intentional about promoting allies, allyship,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:05):**  and when folks step out of their way to be helpful, that should be recognized as something  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:13):**  good and not like a sign of weakness.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:15):**  I recognize that the small farming community and the chef community, we have a lot in common,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:20):**  but oftentimes we're on different schedules.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:23):**  So you guys are waking up and we're just getting to bed and somehow we've managed to make that  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:28):**  work all these years.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:30):**  So keep up the good work.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-44#t=0:28:37):**  Farmerama is made by Katie Revell, Joe Barrett, and myself, Abbey Rose.

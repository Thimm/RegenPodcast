**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:00):**  Given that I'm a geologist and Anne's a kind of a biologist that studies the visible world  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:10):**  of nature, I thought I'd visit farmers who have already restored fertility to their land  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:14):**  and ask, how did you do it?  
**[0:00:16-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:16):**  What did you do?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:17):**  What were your methods?  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:18):**  How long did it take?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:20):**  Did you make money or lose money doing it?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:22):**  All those kind of things that are important to ask about.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:24):**  So I visited farmers, subsistence farmers in Africa and Costa Rica, large scale commodity  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:30):**  crop operations across North America, cattle ranches in Canada and North America, or Canada  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:37):**  and the United States, and basically tried to look for commonalities and patterns.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:44):**  What worked?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:45):**  Why didn't it work?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:46):**  And did some of the ideas that we looked at in previous projects and books play out in  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:50):**  practice?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:52):**  And it really seemed to boil down to the principles of conservation agriculture, the ideas of  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:00:57):**  minimizing disturbance of the soil, of planting cover crops, including legumes, in diverse  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:03):**  rotations.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:04):**  So those sort of three elements of ditching the plow, covering up and growing diversity  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:10):**  were really the common elements between these farmers that had been very successful at restoring  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:14):**  fertility to their land.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:16):**  And that's the nutshell version of the story in Growing a Revolution, was those farmers'  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:21):**  stories, how those general principles really seem to work in a wide range of settings,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:27):**  with or without livestock, there's ways to do it, small farms, large farms, organic farms,  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:33):**  conventional farms, highly capitalized farms with wild modern technology, and very basic  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:40):**  subsistence farms with very minimal technology.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:43):**  Those principles seem to work really well, but the practices that you would use, say,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:48):**  North or South Dakota relative to Ghana, are obviously really different to achieve those  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:53):**  objectives.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:54):**  So I think one of the big challenges and one of the messages that comes out of the book  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:01:57):**  is that we, I think, have a pretty solid understanding now of directions we can go with to rebuild  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:03):**  fertility of soils, but we need to figure out how to adapt those general principles  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:09):**  to the specific settings and farms and technologies and economies and social systems around the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:14):**  world.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:15):**  And that really kind of boils down to that we've done two things really wrong, I think,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:20):**  in agriculture for the last hundred years, and that's we've tried to make soils around  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:26):**  the world respond to the same practices that we export everywhere.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:30):**  We've sort of reduced the diversity of our farming practices and tried to, and therefore,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:35):**  underappreciated the diversity of soils.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:38):**  And we've also underappreciated the ingenuity and creativity of farmers by trying to simplify  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:44):**  and standardize farming practices.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:46):**  And we need to sort of undo both of those things in the service of those three general  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:51):**  principles of conservation agriculture.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:53):**  And if we could do that around the world and convert conventional practices to things that  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:02:58):**  are much more organic-ish because they can greatly reduce the use of fossil fuels, diesel,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:03:06):**  reduce fertilizer use, and reduce herbicide and insecticide use, if we can pull that off  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:03:13):**  and transform conventional practices to these newer regenerative practices, we actually  
**[0:03:18-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-david-montgomery#t=0:03:18):**  really could change the world.

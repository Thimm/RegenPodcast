**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:34):**  Hi Farmerama Radio, my name is Rosie Bristow and I've gotten in touch to tell you all about  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:41):**  my Farm to Fashion project.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:43):**  I'm running it in collaboration with George Young from Fobbing Farms and this year he's  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:49):**  grown a whole hectare of flax which has been an amazing opportunity for me because I'm  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:54):**  really interested in creating a soil to soil textile economy in the UK.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:00):**  And we just harvested it a couple of weeks ago and yeah the harvest was an amazing day  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:05):**  so flax needs to be pulled out of the ground rather than mowed because you want to keep  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:11):**  the roots, like the full plant gets used for fabric making and there currently isn't any  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:18):**  specialist machinery available in the UK to do pulling so it has to be hand done.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:25):**  I think we had about 35 people come to the harvest day and we pulled about an acre of  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:31):**  flax or like about half a hectare and we're keeping the rest for seeds.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:37):**  Yeah, the reason I'm really excited about this is I love the idea of being able to create  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:41):**  a small scale supply chain for fashion.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:45):**  So I was very inspired by the Fibershed movement and their whole ethos is the idea of creating  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:52):**  a fabric economy that's like local, it's good for the environment, using natural fibres,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:59):**  like not using pesticides, not using synthetic dyes or synthetic materials, creating stuff  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:04):**  that's compostable, creating stuff that's like nurturing for the local environment but  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:10):**  also for the local community.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:12):**  So it's creating jobs which are, you know, fun, enjoyable jobs like artisanal weaving,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:19):**  that kind of thing and farming.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:21):**  So really like addressing a lot of the different issues that there is with the fashion industry  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:26):**  at the moment which obviously has like a lot of horrendous things going on with degrading  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:31):**  the environment with like waste problems and with workers rights.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:36):**  And it's also quite similar in a lot of ways to like the slow food movement.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:40):**  So I think the fashion industry is often like a few steps behind where farming and food  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:48):**  is.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:49):**  So for example taking on things to do with like organic materials, with things being  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:55):**  like low carbon or vegan, that kind of thing and I think hopefully the slow fashion movement  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:02):**  which is like really picking up steam at the moment is going to like try and create this  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:08):**  sort of like same local economy that we have at the moment with like local veg delivery  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:13):**  boxes and CSAs and that kind of thing.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:16):**  And my project specifically is focusing on the processing equipment.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:22):**  So I was also really inspired by an episode of this podcast, The Miller is Missing, where  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:26):**  you look at how there's a lot of interest in heritage wheat farming and there's a lot  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:31):**  of interest from small scale bakers but there was a sort of bottleneck of nobody was milling  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:37):**  the raw grains into flour for the bakers to use.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:41):**  And I think there's a really relatable problem in fiber farming in that there are a lot of  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:47):**  farmers who are interested into diversifying into fiber growing, especially farmers who  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:52):**  might currently grow linseed which is very similar to flax and can be used as like a  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:57):**  break crop for wheat.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:59):**  And from the fashion side of things and not just fashion but also interior design, there's  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:05):**  a lot of excitement about being able to use a product which is UK made, which is yeah  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:12):**  compostable, low carbon, it's vegan, there's all these great reasons why you might want  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:16):**  to use like a UK grown like fiber crop, but there's no way to currently process flax in  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:25):**  the UK and if it was then sent overseas to several different places to like a scutching  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:32):**  mill in Belgium say and then to be spun in either like Eastern Europe or China where  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:37):**  most of the spinning takes place, that would kind of negate a lot of the reasons why you'd  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:43):**  want to do it in the first place because it would no longer be like a small local thing  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:48):**  and it wouldn't have such a like low carbon impact.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:52):**  So I'm currently collaborating with Simon and Anne from Flaxland and with some yeah  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:00):**  engineering students, Soma and with some carpenters from Fantasy Farm where I'm based and we're  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:07):**  actually creating our own sort of small to medium scale processing equipment which is  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:14):**  really exciting.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:16):**  So what I'm really hoping is I can keep you guys updated on this project and all the different  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:23):**  steps so yeah today I've just got a few interviews from the harvest and then in the future there's  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:30):**  retting, rippling, scutching, breaking, heckling, like all these different processes it goes  
**[0:06:36-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:36):**  through on its way to becoming clothes and yeah I'll keep you updated on how we get on.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:47):**  It's just really interesting that connection between our clothes and stuff that we grow  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:52):**  and I've just been getting involved in small-scale organic growing and all of the just being  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:57):**  like mind blown by all the amazing things that you can actually grow like really locally  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:02):**  and fairly easily but trying to make that into a model that is accessible for all.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:07):**  Me it's also just about the community, people coming together with like this huge fast map  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:14):**  interest like I've got an engineering background I do a lot of food stuff, there's another  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:17):**  engineer here, you know there's a way we could help with our engineering skills, there's  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:22):**  lots of people who are involved in textiles and fabric, hanging out to cut, hanging out  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:26):**  to dye and weave, it's like a whole bringing together of people and then yeah just a more  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:30):**  ecological way to farm.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:33):**  I feel like we have this huge disconnect between how much it takes in terms of like energy  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:37):**  and input and land to produce something that we then consume very quickly and it just made  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:43):**  me think you know how much more we value like our clothes and if we knew you know we need

**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:07):**  Now we call out this through a number of community-led activities.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:14):**  These include practical farmer trainings in permaculture and regenerative farming, trainings  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:21):**  in water harvesting.

**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:36):**  make sure that we organize them and mobilize them through groups through which they can

**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:53):**  farming so that they can feed their households.

**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:04):**  they like I mean they farm on this land for so many years so the land loses nutrients  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:09):**  and this is how we come in with our regenerative farming.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:12):**  We want to engage refugees to be able to use their small pieces of land sustainably to  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:19):**  be able to get enough food for their households and also an income through selling extra food.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:26):**  So what we do, we introduce permaculture designs where we help refugees set up our kitchen  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:32):**  gardens, vegetable gardens, food forests and also introduce them to tree planting which  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:40):**  is key because normally when refugees settle into a place the first thing they do is to  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:44):**  cut trees for firewood, for charcoal and also for selling so that they can survive so we  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:49):**  try as much as possible to regenerate all these and help them to you know live in a  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:55):**  really nice environment where they have enough food, where they have enough income and where  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:00):**  they are happy.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:02):**  Most refugees that we have in Uganda are in what we call protracted refugee situation  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:08):**  so they have been in Uganda for over 10 years.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:12):**  We try as much as possible to look at this as a way of creating their resilience and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:20):**  making sure that they are self-reliant while they are in the refugee settlements.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:24):**  For the food forest for example we basically try as much as possible to promote fast-growing  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:29):**  foods like poppies, sugar canes so even if someone has stayed in a place for three years  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:35):**  they can always have these poppies and sugar canes but the interesting bit is while a few  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:40):**  refugees will repatriate more others are coming so they will still benefit from the trees  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:46):**  and the food that we have planted so it's basically a continuous process where sometimes  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:52):**  we have a few that will say okay we are going back to our home countries it's now safe but  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:57):**  then we are having more that are coming who are then given that land and we start from  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:02):**  there and continue helping them.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:04):**  Of course we do this because normally the food that is provided to them by the World  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:09):**  Food Programme and UNHCR is not always enough, it's not nutritious enough for them to be

**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:22):**  the efforts by those organisations and make sure that there is enough food and the environment  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:26):**  is conserved.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:27):**  Whether they will be there or not we want to make sure that the trees are there, the

**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:37):**  the land fertile and safe for them to stay.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:42):**  When we started implementing our activities especially the kitchen gardens we learned  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:49):**  that the area where we are working is really affected by climate change.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:56):**  We normally have long periods of dry spells that would run for up to three, four, up to  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:03):**  six months and so farmers are not able to produce or to maintain their kitchen gardens  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:09):**  and be able to get food from them.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:11):**  So what we did was to innovate or invent a small drip irrigation kit.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:17):**  We make this kit using locally available materials.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:21):**  The beauty of this system and why we call it mobile is because it's small, it can irrigate  
**[0:13:26-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:26):**  an area of 50 by 100 feet, 50 feet by 100 and if a farmer has a piece of land which  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:35):**  is bigger than that or a garden which is bigger than that then they can move it from one side  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:40):**  of the garden to another side of the garden.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:43):**  So we've been able to sell out over 365 drip irrigation kits to small-holder farmers and  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:52):**  these have really found them really helpful because they have been able to produce their  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:56):**  vegetables throughout the year, throughout the season without having to worry of whether  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:01):**  it has rained or not and they are having this sustainable income coming to their households  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:07):**  but also they have sustainable access to food.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:12):**  What our organisation is doing in addition to the mobile drip irrigation kit already  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:18):**  is to promote tree planting to make sure that there are many more trees that are planted  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:24):**  and we are basically planting the backcloth tree because it's fast growing but farmers  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:29):**  can also use it for making, getting fuel or firewood for cooking easily and it's also  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:37):**  used to make clothes in Uganda so it's really a multi-purpose kind of tree.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:43):**  Other things we are doing is to create awareness about climate change, educating farmers about  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:50):**  the effects of poor farming methods, using chemicals and things like that so that they  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:59):**  are able to conserve the biodiversity and also reduce on climate change.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:06):**  But also we are doing things such as promoting organic farming, we have trained our farmers  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:11):**  to make organic fertilisers for their, I mean that they can use in their gardens and reduce  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:17):**  the usage of chemicals so all these interventions we are doing is trying to make sure that we  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:22):**  reduce on the effects of climate change and we make farmers climate, being able to adapt  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:28):**  to climate change as and when it does happen.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:32):**  One beautiful thing is that our systems that we are promoting are actually the systems  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:37):**  that our grandparents were using but probably unknowingly I would say and I think these  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:44):**  have been dropped by the so-called modern farmers of today who want to use chemicals,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:51):**  game oil seeds and things like that.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:53):**  So one of the things that we are actually promoting is seed bulking or keeping seeds

**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:10):**  sorted them very well, you have stored them really well, you can use them.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:14):**  And we are also promoting a lot of local knowledge.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:18):**  We have embarked on a process of engaging with elder people in our communities to give  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:24):**  us those key items or those key skills or tips that we are using in farming for example,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:31):**  how are they controlling pest and diseases without having to buy chemicals, how are they  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:37):**  keeping their soils fertile.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:39):**  So we are documenting all these to make sure that we can keep all this information and  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:44):**  pass it on to the rest of the farmers in the community.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:47):**  We set up a demonstration garden near a hunt hill and when we did mulch, the termites ate  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:55):**  all the mulch that we had put in the garden.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:58):**  And one of the farmers we had in the group advised us, of course we are looking at ways  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:02):**  of you know, sending out the termite without actually killing it and the farmers advised  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:08):**  us that we can use the pig's intestines.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:11):**  So it advised us to go to a butcher where they make pork and get the intestines and  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:17):**  put them in the termite hill.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:19):**  And when we did it, it actually worked.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:22):**  So the termite left, we didn't see any termites die but it left the place and it migrated  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:28):**  to another area.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:29):**  So these are some of the tips that we are now introducing to our farmers.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:32):**  But you know what, instead of, termites are very key in our soil, so instead of using  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:36):**  chemicals to kill them, can you just use this method from what our grandparents used and  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:42):**  then they just move away and then you remain happy.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:45):**  So these are some of the things that we are promoting.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:48):**  Our work is built around empowering the women and the young people who we think have always  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:55):**  been left out of the mainstream programs implemented by governments, by big organizations.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:02):**  So we want to make sure that we are empowering this and we have learned that over time, when  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:07):**  you give women and young people the opportunity to share the experiences, to practically participate  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:13):**  in actions that are concerned, that are about their issues or address their issues, you'll  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:21):**  be successful and you'll be happy.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:23):**  So one of the things we have seen is some of the women that we have worked with have  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:27):**  ended up taking on leadership roles in the community, like they have gotten out of support  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:32):**  from their husbands.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:33):**  They say, we are now more respected because we can also contribute towards the household  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:37):**  income.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:38):**  And these are some of the things that we've really found really very, very interesting.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:41):**  Yeah, and of course, lastly, the importance of networking and having partnerships.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:47):**  So of course, the more we network, the more we share our stories, the more we get opportunities  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:53):**  to work with so many new people.

**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:58):**  and we look forward to sharing more and answering any further questions that the listeners would

**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:57):**  on RegenAg to summer camps for kids learning about the land.

**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:10):**  knowledge about different activities on the farm.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:13):**  They've teamed up with universities to host students and provide a space for practical  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:17):**  research projects that support the student, but also they learn about different aspects  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:23):**  of the farm at the same time.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:29):**  We have met kind of a funny student.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:33):**  Funny is not the right word, but he was actually a marine biologist studying for marine biology.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:41):**  And he came here to the desert.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:44):**  So we told him like, you do know that there's very little water here, right?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:48):**  And he was like, yeah, no, I love it.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:51):**  And we talked and we talked and we found this topic about the ponds that we have that have  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:56):**  a lot of animals and they attract a lot of animals.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:00):**  And you can say a lot about which animals come if your ponds and your water is healthy.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:08):**  So he researched that and he found out all these things about which ponds were more healthy  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:13):**  than others and which attracted the kind of animals and pollinators that we also like  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:18):**  to attract and which ones did not yet have that function.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:22):**  He also looked over the years, so young ponds versus old ponds to see how this might develop  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:28):**  in the future.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:30):**  And that was a very interesting research because it gave us a lot of insights also on how like  
**[0:21:35-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:35):**  adult ponds work and how also that the young ponds within a year can already have many  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:44):**  of the functions of these older ponds as well.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:47):**  So that's just an example of a research that happened here that was very nice and useful.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:52):**  So often a pond is just a pond like we don't consider it that much as an ecosystem or a  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:00):**  web and a tool for the whole farm.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:02):**  Yeah, but indeed, like we, for example, didn't know that dragonflies are apparently they  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:10):**  need clean water so they don't go to like polluted water.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:15):**  So when you see dragonflies, that's a good sign.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:19):**  That was very nice insight because it's also something you can share with people around  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:25):**  and it's like an easy little tool to measure the health of a pond.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:31):**  Just thinking about him individually, like did it change his kind of career path or do  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:36):**  you think he became or yeah, what effect did it have on him?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:41):**  So he got more interested in farming for sure.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:46):**  And he also got to see how his studies, even though it's very marine based, can also connect

**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:14):**  We even have in this farm a plot of four hectares, that is where the ecosystem restoration camp

**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:45):**  And after doing many experiments, now at least us in this farm, we've been able to find a  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:50):**  system that we leave a ground cover during the autumn and the winter months of the year  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:56):**  that is quite cold and is where most of the rain and precipitation happens and the soil  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:02):**  has more humidity.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:03):**  In some cases it's a seeded ground cover with legumes and grains and in other cases it's  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:09):**  spontaneous.

**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:16):**  the seeded one with legumes is the one that works generally the best.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:22):**  I personally don't think that it's just the weed competition, because if you till for  
**[0:25:27-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:27):**  the first time, let's say in April, beginning of April, then you are killing the weeds,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:37):**  the grasses that are growing there.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:40):**  But then if you till in August, there's already no vegetation, but you do see a big difference  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:47):**  if you do that tilling or not in August.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:49):**  For me it was a huge change because it was after a rain and there was no vegetation,  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:56):**  so that improvement didn't happen because of the vegetation.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:00):**  I think that is generally because of breaking the capillarity between the layers of soil,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:05):**  because you're getting basically very dry at first, 10 centimetres, but you're breaking  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:11):**  that connection in the lower layer of the soil and then the humidity cannot get out  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:18):**  and then the tree uses that humidity.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:22):**  Also there's a theory about the oxygen, or that then the organic matter becomes available  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:29):**  faster or that it decomposes faster.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:33):**  I've heard all types of theories.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:35):**  I don't know the technical details, but it seems that most of it is because of the water  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:41):**  and the water is more water competition.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:45):**  We've seen a gigantic difference between doing those three tillings to doing one or doing  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:51):**  none.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:52):**  It's not a small difference, it's really, really big.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:55):**  Then you have to always find the balance.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:56):**  Some people say that there is no difference between three times and eight times for the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:01):**  trees, but that it's not better, but that is actually really bad for the soil to till  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:05):**  that many times.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:07):**  So for the soil it's quite clear that it's bad to till eight times, but what I've seen  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:12):**  is that unfortunately the trees that are tilled eight times, indeed in the short term they  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:17):**  do much better and they grow a lot faster.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:22):**  The balance we've found so far is this one of tilling maximum three times and leaving  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:29):**  those lines of vegetation and not tilling autumn and winter and adding compost.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:35):**  They've also used swales and ponds across the farm to build biodiversity, prevent soil  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:40):**  erosion and retain water in the soil for longer periods.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:44):**  Arthur gives us some of the details of how that works.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:48):**  The swales we've been doing them for the last five years already.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:52):**  Now most of the ones we do, or all the ones we've been doing later, are quite wide.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:57):**  We do it with a tractor, with a blade that is a polydozer.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:00):**  We first mark it with some sticks and a laser and then the tractor goes behind.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:08):**  In one day you can do quite a good amount of kilometers.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:12):**  So it's a much more efficient way of doing some earthworks and controlling erosion than  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:19):**  for example a terrace that you have to move a lot more soil than one of these swales.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:26):**  They also need maintenance, the swales, but I like them more.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:31):**  The swales we are making now are about five meters wide and about 70 centimeters, 60 centimeters  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:42):**  deep.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:45):**  Maybe even a bit more.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:47):**  And then we are making them, all of them, except the one we just made in the vineyard,  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:54):**  all the rest are in grain fields, in parts that are especially steep and that had a lot  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:00):**  of erosion.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:02):**  And we've been making these swales, we have now about 15 kilometers, something like that,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:07):**  maybe a bit more.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:09):**  And we also combine them with little dams on the weak points of those swales where a  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:13):**  lot of water and runoff gets concentrated so they don't silt up too fast.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:20):**  And we've also been planting them for the last few years with trees on the lower part  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:26):**  of the swale and also bushes and aromatic plants.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:31):**  Most of it is just natural species for biodiversity and we've also combined some with almonds  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:39):**  and with olive trees.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:41):**  And these swales, I really like them because they do a lot of services at the same time.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:48):**  One is the most obvious, the erosion control, but also you have the humidity that they create  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:55):**  around them is higher than in the, a lot more than in the rest.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:59):**  So then that combined with the sediments that they keep there, year over year, it becomes

**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:15):**  So those trees at the beginning, they suffer a bit because it's so dry and then they don't  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:20):**  get immediately all those benefits in the first year because it takes a few years to  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:25):**  build up.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:26):**  But I do think they're going to do really well in the future.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:29):**  There are going to be some of the happier or better developed vegetation.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:36):**  And then also they are really good corridors for wildlife because after you harvest the  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:41):**  grains for example, it looks a bit barren, like gigantic fields.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:47):**  So these corridors are really useful for the wildlife to nest some of the birds, but also  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:52):**  to cross the wild boars, the foxes, the rabbits, a lot of it.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:58):**  And yeah, then it's also that a bit of a safe place for a lot of the species that for example,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:03):**  in one year we put barley in that plot, but then these swales still have a lot of seeds  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:09):**  that we've been planting of very tall varieties of wheat or rye.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:14):**  And then yeah, it's a bit bushy and good for especially partridges that we see them nesting  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:20):**  in these swales.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:22):**  And also after we harvest, then they still have that there.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:28):**  We've been building ponds in the last also five or six years since we started with the  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:32):**  first one.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:33):**  We have about 70 something or maybe 80 something already.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:37):**  I lost a bit track of them.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:40):**  Some are quite small and they are these little dams that help a bit the weak parts of the  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:46):**  swales, but others are quite big that are almost one hectare of surface that they can  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:50):**  hold many thousand cubic meters of water.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:55):**  They're all great.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:56):**  I like them all.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:57):**  The little ones, the bigger ones.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:59):**  Some of them hold water all year round.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:03):**  Some of them just only for a few days after strong rain events.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:08):**  But they all are quite useful for biodiversity.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:12):**  Some are these little hotspots with vegetation and a bit more humid that for the summer for  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:18):**  a lot of these birds or rabbits that are breeding, they have a bit of a different vegetation  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:23):**  there and a bit of coverage.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:26):**  And yeah, the bigger ones and the ones that have water all year round, those are little  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:32):**  oases in this very arid place.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:35):**  And then you see that they are really full of life in the summer and full of tracks and  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:39):**  full of insects, animals, everything.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:42):**  And then thanks to a student that did some research, we found out that even a lot of  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:48):**  the insects that breed in the pond are also pollinators that are helping us with the almond  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:53):**  production that we didn't even think about it, but apparently it's happening as well.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:00):**  And yeah, the ponds, I think they are really helping a lot with the biodiversity.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:05):**  It's not just providing water, but it's water, the plants around, it's shelter for breeding,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:11):**  it's little different habitats.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:18):**  I was really amazed by the difference between the almonds that were tilled between one and  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:24):**  three times in a year and then the no-till almonds.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:27):**  It was immediately visible.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:30):**  The no-till almonds were really struggling.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:32):**  They were kind of much weaker, thinner trunks, and they were right next to each other, these  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:37):**  almonds.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:39):**  I have to admit that I was quite shocked when I saw all the bare soil and by the tilling  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:45):**  of the top 10 centimeters of soil between these nut trees.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:48):**  That bare earth goes against everything I've learned.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:51):**  And when I touched the soil on the surface, it was brittle and dust-like, although going  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:56):**  down a few centimeters, there was much more moisture and better structured soil.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:02):**  Obviously that topsoil is still very fragile and could easily blow away in summer windstorms.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:07):**  But in farming, there are always compromises.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:10):**  And as Alfonso said, they are building carbon in the soil using their cover cropping in  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:16):**  part of the year.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:17):**  It appears the soil isn't degrading as a whole.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:20):**  So maybe for the early years of growing rain-fed almonds in drier areas, the top 10 centimeters  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:26):**  of soil needs to become lifeless.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:29):**  I have actually seen similar patterns in, like when establishing vines, they've had  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:35):**  similar findings.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:37):**  Or maybe there's something else we don't quite understand in this situation.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:41):**  For me, this experience was a good reminder that there are no dogmas in regenerative approaches  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:46):**  to farming.

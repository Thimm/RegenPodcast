**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:00:16):**  Even the smallest contribution makes a big difference to us, so if you'd like to become  a supporter, you can visit patreon.com forward slash Farmerama.  This month, we begin learning what it takes to turn straw into gold, aka flax into linen,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:00:37):**  in the UK.  We head to Uganda to hear how refugee and local communities are coming together and  using permaculture techniques to build flourishing farms.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:00:47):**  And we hear from farmers in the mountains of Spain who are experimenting with many different  regenerative approaches at scale in their dry, desertification prone landscape.  Rosie Bristow is based at Fantasy Organic Farm in Scotland and is currently studying  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:09):**  an MSc in Fashion and Textile Management.  As part of her studies, she began to investigate fibre farming and processing in the UK.  This summer, she teamed up with George Young at Fobbing Farm in Essex to harvest his flax  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:23):**  and is now using that harvest to prototype different processing equipment to turn the  straw into gold.  Rosie's a listener and she sent us in this recording, so thank you so much Rosie for  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:33):**  doing that.  Hi Farmerama Radio, my name is Rosie Bristow and I've gotten in touch to tell you all about  my Farm to Fashion project.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:01:43):**  I'm running it in collaboration with George Young from Fobbing Farms and this year he's  grown a whole hectare of flax which has been an amazing opportunity for me because I'm  really interested in creating a soil to soil textile economy in the UK.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:00):**  And we just harvested it a couple of weeks ago and yeah the harvest was an amazing day  so flax needs to be pulled out of the ground rather than mowed because you want to keep  the roots, like the full plant gets used for fabric making and there currently isn't any  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:18):**  specialist machinery available in the UK to do pulling so it has to be hand done.  I think we had about 35 people come to the harvest day and we pulled about an acre of  flax or like about half a hectare and we're keeping the rest for seeds.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:37):**  Yeah, the reason I'm really excited about this is I love the idea of being able to create  a small scale supply chain for fashion.  So I was very inspired by the Fibershed movement and their whole ethos is the idea of creating  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:02:52):**  a fabric economy that's like local, it's good for the environment, using natural fibres,  like not using pesticides, not using synthetic dyes or synthetic materials, creating stuff  that's compostable, creating stuff that's like nurturing for the local environment but  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:10):**  also for the local community.  So it's creating jobs which are, you know, fun, enjoyable jobs like artisanal weaving,  that kind of thing and farming.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:21):**  So really like addressing a lot of the different issues that there is with the fashion industry  at the moment which obviously has like a lot of horrendous things going on with degrading  the environment with like waste problems and with workers rights.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:36):**  And it's also quite similar in a lot of ways to like the slow food movement.  So I think the fashion industry is often like a few steps behind where farming and food  is.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:03:49):**  So for example taking on things to do with like organic materials, with things being  like low carbon or vegan, that kind of thing and I think hopefully the slow fashion movement  which is like really picking up steam at the moment is going to like try and create this  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:08):**  sort of like same local economy that we have at the moment with like local veg delivery  boxes and CSAs and that kind of thing.  And my project specifically is focusing on the processing equipment.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:22):**  So I was also really inspired by an episode of this podcast, The Miller is Missing, where  you look at how there's a lot of interest in heritage wheat farming and there's a lot  of interest from small scale bakers but there was a sort of bottleneck of nobody was milling  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:37):**  the raw grains into flour for the bakers to use.  And I think there's a really relatable problem in fiber farming in that there are a lot of  farmers who are interested into diversifying into fiber growing, especially farmers who  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:04:52):**  might currently grow linseed which is very similar to flax and can be used as like a  break crop for wheat.  And from the fashion side of things and not just fashion but also interior design, there's  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:05):**  a lot of excitement about being able to use a product which is UK made, which is yeah  compostable, low carbon, it's vegan, there's all these great reasons why you might want  to use like a UK grown like fiber crop, but there's no way to currently process flax in  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:25):**  the UK and if it was then sent overseas to several different places to like a scutching  mill in Belgium say and then to be spun in either like Eastern Europe or China where  most of the spinning takes place, that would kind of negate a lot of the reasons why you'd  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:05:43):**  want to do it in the first place because it would no longer be like a small local thing  and it wouldn't have such a like low carbon impact.  So I'm currently collaborating with Simon and Anne from Flaxland and with some yeah  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:00):**  engineering students, Soma and with some carpenters from Fantasy Farm where I'm based and we're  actually creating our own sort of small to medium scale processing equipment which is  really exciting.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:16):**  So what I'm really hoping is I can keep you guys updated on this project and all the different  steps so yeah today I've just got a few interviews from the harvest and then in the future there's  retting, rippling, scutching, breaking, heckling, like all these different processes it goes  
**[0:06:36-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:36):**  through on its way to becoming clothes and yeah I'll keep you updated on how we get on.  It's just really interesting that connection between our clothes and stuff that we grow  and I've just been getting involved in small-scale organic growing and all of the just being  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:06:57):**  like mind blown by all the amazing things that you can actually grow like really locally  and fairly easily but trying to make that into a model that is accessible for all.  Me it's also just about the community, people coming together with like this huge fast map  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:14):**  interest like I've got an engineering background I do a lot of food stuff, there's another  engineer here, you know there's a way we could help with our engineering skills, there's  lots of people who are involved in textiles and fabric, hanging out to cut, hanging out  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:26):**  to dye and weave, it's like a whole bringing together of people and then yeah just a more  ecological way to farm.  I feel like we have this huge disconnect between how much it takes in terms of like energy  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:37):**  and input and land to produce something that we then consume very quickly and it just made  me think you know how much more we value like our clothes and if we knew you know we need  two, what is it, so two square meters of this to make one tea towel and I think if it was  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:07:53):**  optimum conditions it would be one square meter to make a tea towel.  It's been such a nice day of meeting people all with this shared interest but in very  different ways so there's weavers and spinners and people interested in textiles but then  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:08:06):**  also people interested in farming and just having a day out and it's just this amazing  assortment of people, I'm loving it.  Yise Uganda promote practical regenerative farming activities for smallholder farmers.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:08:26):**  Specializing in areas that are receiving large numbers of refugees into the country.  Uganda has a population of around 1.4 million refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo,  South Sudan, Rwanda and many more East African countries.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:08:41):**  We spoke to the organization's founder Noah Sempija.  Now the goal of our intervention is threefold, one, we want to promote food security, two,  we want to regenerate the biodiversity and achieve climate change adaptation and as well  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:01):**  as we want to improve incomes for smallholder farmers in Uganda.  Now we call out this through a number of community-led activities.  These include practical farmer trainings in permaculture and regenerative farming, trainings  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:21):**  in water harvesting.  We have invented a mobile drip irrigation kit which helps farmers to you know to irrigate  but you also introduce production of organic fertilizers for smallholder farmers and also  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:36):**  make sure that we organize them and mobilize them through groups through which they can  learn.  These refugees are settled into what we call refugee settlements and the government is  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:09:47):**  lenient enough to give them small pieces of land from which they could cut out small-scale  farming so that they can feed their households.  Now because these pieces of land they are given are small and they do intensive farming,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:04):**  they like I mean they farm on this land for so many years so the land loses nutrients  and this is how we come in with our regenerative farming.  We want to engage refugees to be able to use their small pieces of land sustainably to  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:19):**  be able to get enough food for their households and also an income through selling extra food.  So what we do, we introduce permaculture designs where we help refugees set up our kitchen  gardens, vegetable gardens, food forests and also introduce them to tree planting which  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:40):**  is key because normally when refugees settle into a place the first thing they do is to  cut trees for firewood, for charcoal and also for selling so that they can survive so we  try as much as possible to regenerate all these and help them to you know live in a  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:10:55):**  really nice environment where they have enough food, where they have enough income and where  they are happy.  Most refugees that we have in Uganda are in what we call protracted refugee situation  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:08):**  so they have been in Uganda for over 10 years.  We try as much as possible to look at this as a way of creating their resilience and  making sure that they are self-reliant while they are in the refugee settlements.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:24):**  For the food forest for example we basically try as much as possible to promote fast-growing  foods like poppies, sugar canes so even if someone has stayed in a place for three years  they can always have these poppies and sugar canes but the interesting bit is while a few  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:40):**  refugees will repatriate more others are coming so they will still benefit from the trees  and the food that we have planted so it's basically a continuous process where sometimes  we have a few that will say okay we are going back to our home countries it's now safe but  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:11:57):**  then we are having more that are coming who are then given that land and we start from  there and continue helping them.  Of course we do this because normally the food that is provided to them by the World  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:09):**  Food Programme and UNHCR is not always enough, it's not nutritious enough for them to be  able to live happier lives and to help their children feed well so all we do is to supplement  the efforts by those organisations and make sure that there is enough food and the environment  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:26):**  is conserved.  Whether they will be there or not we want to make sure that the trees are there, the  birds are happy and the people that will stay in those areas in the time to come will find  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:37):**  the land fertile and safe for them to stay.  When we started implementing our activities especially the kitchen gardens we learned  that the area where we are working is really affected by climate change.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:12:56):**  We normally have long periods of dry spells that would run for up to three, four, up to  six months and so farmers are not able to produce or to maintain their kitchen gardens  and be able to get food from them.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:11):**  So what we did was to innovate or invent a small drip irrigation kit.  We make this kit using locally available materials.  The beauty of this system and why we call it mobile is because it's small, it can irrigate  
**[0:13:26-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:26):**  an area of 50 by 100 feet, 50 feet by 100 and if a farmer has a piece of land which  is bigger than that or a garden which is bigger than that then they can move it from one side  of the garden to another side of the garden.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:13:43):**  So we've been able to sell out over 365 drip irrigation kits to small-holder farmers and  these have really found them really helpful because they have been able to produce their  vegetables throughout the year, throughout the season without having to worry of whether  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:01):**  it has rained or not and they are having this sustainable income coming to their households  but also they have sustainable access to food.  What our organisation is doing in addition to the mobile drip irrigation kit already  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:18):**  is to promote tree planting to make sure that there are many more trees that are planted  and we are basically planting the backcloth tree because it's fast growing but farmers  can also use it for making, getting fuel or firewood for cooking easily and it's also  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:37):**  used to make clothes in Uganda so it's really a multi-purpose kind of tree.  Other things we are doing is to create awareness about climate change, educating farmers about  the effects of poor farming methods, using chemicals and things like that so that they  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:14:59):**  are able to conserve the biodiversity and also reduce on climate change.  But also we are doing things such as promoting organic farming, we have trained our farmers  to make organic fertilisers for their, I mean that they can use in their gardens and reduce  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:17):**  the usage of chemicals so all these interventions we are doing is trying to make sure that we  reduce on the effects of climate change and we make farmers climate, being able to adapt  to climate change as and when it does happen.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:32):**  One beautiful thing is that our systems that we are promoting are actually the systems  that our grandparents were using but probably unknowingly I would say and I think these  have been dropped by the so-called modern farmers of today who want to use chemicals,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:15:51):**  game oil seeds and things like that.  So one of the things that we are actually promoting is seed bulking or keeping seeds  for the planting for the next season.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:02):**  Instead of buying game oil seeds we always advise farmers that you know what, you can  keep your seeds and you will be able to plant them in the next season as well as you have  sorted them very well, you have stored them really well, you can use them.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:14):**  And we are also promoting a lot of local knowledge.  We have embarked on a process of engaging with elder people in our communities to give  us those key items or those key skills or tips that we are using in farming for example,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:31):**  how are they controlling pest and diseases without having to buy chemicals, how are they  keeping their soils fertile.  So we are documenting all these to make sure that we can keep all this information and  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:44):**  pass it on to the rest of the farmers in the community.  We set up a demonstration garden near a hunt hill and when we did mulch, the termites ate  all the mulch that we had put in the garden.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:16:58):**  And one of the farmers we had in the group advised us, of course we are looking at ways  of you know, sending out the termite without actually killing it and the farmers advised  us that we can use the pig's intestines.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:11):**  So it advised us to go to a butcher where they make pork and get the intestines and  put them in the termite hill.  And when we did it, it actually worked.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:22):**  So the termite left, we didn't see any termites die but it left the place and it migrated  to another area.  So these are some of the tips that we are now introducing to our farmers.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:32):**  But you know what, instead of, termites are very key in our soil, so instead of using  chemicals to kill them, can you just use this method from what our grandparents used and  then they just move away and then you remain happy.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:17:45):**  So these are some of the things that we are promoting.  Our work is built around empowering the women and the young people who we think have always  been left out of the mainstream programs implemented by governments, by big organizations.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:02):**  So we want to make sure that we are empowering this and we have learned that over time, when  you give women and young people the opportunity to share the experiences, to practically participate  in actions that are concerned, that are about their issues or address their issues, you'll  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:21):**  be successful and you'll be happy.  So one of the things we have seen is some of the women that we have worked with have  ended up taking on leadership roles in the community, like they have gotten out of support  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:32):**  from their husbands.  They say, we are now more respected because we can also contribute towards the household  income.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:38):**  And these are some of the things that we've really found really very, very interesting.  Yeah, and of course, lastly, the importance of networking and having partnerships.  So of course, the more we network, the more we share our stories, the more we get opportunities  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:18:53):**  to work with so many new people.  So I hope the stories that we have shared here will be listened to by so many people  and we look forward to sharing more and answering any further questions that the listeners would  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:03):**  have.  La Junquera is a 1000 hectare organic farm high up in the Spanish Altiplano.  It's run by Alfonso Chico Guzman and Yannick Schoonhoven.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:17):**  It's an incredibly vast dry landscape with under 300 millimetres of rain a year.  And La Junquera is a beautiful, once bustling farm village that they're slowly bringing  back to life.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:29):**  We'll hear from them a few times over the next few months because their farming landscape  extends far beyond the farm gate.  They're a great example of the power of collective action across many farms and organisations,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:42):**  all working with the same aim to build more regenerative farming landscapes and supply  networks.  One of those initiatives is the Regeneration Academy.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:19:52):**  They offer a number of different educational opportunities from a one week crash course  on RegenAg to summer camps for kids learning about the land.  One of the courses they offer is the Regeneration Academy Research Programme.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:05):**  And this has become a key part of the farm's ecosystem, as it's a vital way that they build  knowledge about different activities on the farm.  They've teamed up with universities to host students and provide a space for practical  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:17):**  research projects that support the student, but also they learn about different aspects  of the farm at the same time.  We have met kind of a funny student.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:33):**  Funny is not the right word, but he was actually a marine biologist studying for marine biology.  And he came here to the desert.  So we told him like, you do know that there's very little water here, right?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:20:48):**  And he was like, yeah, no, I love it.  And we talked and we talked and we found this topic about the ponds that we have that have  a lot of animals and they attract a lot of animals.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:00):**  And you can say a lot about which animals come if your ponds and your water is healthy.  So he researched that and he found out all these things about which ponds were more healthy  than others and which attracted the kind of animals and pollinators that we also like  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:18):**  to attract and which ones did not yet have that function.  He also looked over the years, so young ponds versus old ponds to see how this might develop  in the future.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:30):**  And that was a very interesting research because it gave us a lot of insights also on how like  adult ponds work and how also that the young ponds within a year can already have many  of the functions of these older ponds as well.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:21:47):**  So that's just an example of a research that happened here that was very nice and useful.  So often a pond is just a pond like we don't consider it that much as an ecosystem or a  web and a tool for the whole farm.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:02):**  Yeah, but indeed, like we, for example, didn't know that dragonflies are apparently they  need clean water so they don't go to like polluted water.  So when you see dragonflies, that's a good sign.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:19):**  That was very nice insight because it's also something you can share with people around  and it's like an easy little tool to measure the health of a pond.  Just thinking about him individually, like did it change his kind of career path or do  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:36):**  you think he became or yeah, what effect did it have on him?  So he got more interested in farming for sure.  And he also got to see how his studies, even though it's very marine based, can also connect  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:22:52):**  to this type of environment.  So indeed, like I think many times with studies you have a certain topic and you think that's  the only thing that then you know about, but many times it's also a way of thinking, a  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:23:07):**  way of seeing stuff.  And that is what you will use in later life and not necessarily all the theory that you've  read.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:23:14):**  At La Junquera they farm heritage grains, they have some cows, sheep, they have vegetable  gardens, aromatics, and they have a sizable amount of rain-fed almonds and pistachios.  When Alfonso returned to the family farm, he had many ideas about how he was going to  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:23:33):**  build soil health and farm no-till rain-fed almonds.  He'd read all the books and he was going to show the locals how it could be done.  However, it hasn't quite worked out like that.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:23:48):**  The yields, it's not that they dropped a bit, it's basically they disappeared and even quite  a high percentage of the trees died as well.  And we've tried in many different farms, also many different years of different ages of  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:02):**  trees.  Indeed, we've seen that when the trees are bigger and older, they are a lot more resilient  to these things.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:10):**  But especially when they are small, then that's quite tough for them.  We even have in this farm a plot of four hectares, that is where the ecosystem restoration camp  is established, with totally no-tilled trees.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:24):**  We are also monitoring different practices, so we have a bit of all the examples to compare.  We've been trying to find some middle ground between completely no-tilling to tilling eight  times a year.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:36):**  This is the case of many farmers here, that there is a big way to improve and you don't  have to go to any of those extremes.  And after doing many experiments, now at least us in this farm, we've been able to find a  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:24:50):**  system that we leave a ground cover during the autumn and the winter months of the year  that is quite cold and is where most of the rain and precipitation happens and the soil  has more humidity.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:03):**  In some cases it's a seeded ground cover with legumes and grains and in other cases it's  spontaneous.  Most of it is spontaneous because it's ongoing, these experiments, but now we've seen that  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:16):**  the seeded one with legumes is the one that works generally the best.  I personally don't think that it's just the weed competition, because if you till for  the first time, let's say in April, beginning of April, then you are killing the weeds,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:37):**  the grasses that are growing there.  But then if you till in August, there's already no vegetation, but you do see a big difference  if you do that tilling or not in August.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:25:49):**  For me it was a huge change because it was after a rain and there was no vegetation,  so that improvement didn't happen because of the vegetation.  I think that is generally because of breaking the capillarity between the layers of soil,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:05):**  because you're getting basically very dry at first, 10 centimetres, but you're breaking  that connection in the lower layer of the soil and then the humidity cannot get out  and then the tree uses that humidity.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:22):**  Also there's a theory about the oxygen, or that then the organic matter becomes available  faster or that it decomposes faster.  I've heard all types of theories.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:35):**  I don't know the technical details, but it seems that most of it is because of the water  and the water is more water competition.  We've seen a gigantic difference between doing those three tillings to doing one or doing  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:51):**  none.  It's not a small difference, it's really, really big.  Then you have to always find the balance.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:26:56):**  Some people say that there is no difference between three times and eight times for the  trees, but that it's not better, but that is actually really bad for the soil to till  that many times.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:07):**  So for the soil it's quite clear that it's bad to till eight times, but what I've seen  is that unfortunately the trees that are tilled eight times, indeed in the short term they  do much better and they grow a lot faster.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:22):**  The balance we've found so far is this one of tilling maximum three times and leaving  those lines of vegetation and not tilling autumn and winter and adding compost.  They've also used swales and ponds across the farm to build biodiversity, prevent soil  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:40):**  erosion and retain water in the soil for longer periods.  Arthur gives us some of the details of how that works.  The swales we've been doing them for the last five years already.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:27:52):**  Now most of the ones we do, or all the ones we've been doing later, are quite wide.  We do it with a tractor, with a blade that is a polydozer.  We first mark it with some sticks and a laser and then the tractor goes behind.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:08):**  In one day you can do quite a good amount of kilometers.  So it's a much more efficient way of doing some earthworks and controlling erosion than  for example a terrace that you have to move a lot more soil than one of these swales.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:26):**  They also need maintenance, the swales, but I like them more.  The swales we are making now are about five meters wide and about 70 centimeters, 60 centimeters  deep.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:28:45):**  Maybe even a bit more.  And then we are making them, all of them, except the one we just made in the vineyard,  all the rest are in grain fields, in parts that are especially steep and that had a lot  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:00):**  of erosion.  And we've been making these swales, we have now about 15 kilometers, something like that,  maybe a bit more.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:09):**  And we also combine them with little dams on the weak points of those swales where a  lot of water and runoff gets concentrated so they don't silt up too fast.  And we've also been planting them for the last few years with trees on the lower part  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:26):**  of the swale and also bushes and aromatic plants.  Most of it is just natural species for biodiversity and we've also combined some with almonds  and with olive trees.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:41):**  And these swales, I really like them because they do a lot of services at the same time.  One is the most obvious, the erosion control, but also you have the humidity that they create  around them is higher than in the, a lot more than in the rest.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:29:59):**  So then that combined with the sediments that they keep there, year over year, it becomes  a more fertile and more humid line of soil.  So those trees at the beginning, they suffer a bit because it's so dry and then they don't  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:20):**  get immediately all those benefits in the first year because it takes a few years to  build up.  But I do think they're going to do really well in the future.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:29):**  There are going to be some of the happier or better developed vegetation.  And then also they are really good corridors for wildlife because after you harvest the  grains for example, it looks a bit barren, like gigantic fields.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:30:47):**  So these corridors are really useful for the wildlife to nest some of the birds, but also  to cross the wild boars, the foxes, the rabbits, a lot of it.  And yeah, then it's also that a bit of a safe place for a lot of the species that for example,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:03):**  in one year we put barley in that plot, but then these swales still have a lot of seeds  that we've been planting of very tall varieties of wheat or rye.  And then yeah, it's a bit bushy and good for especially partridges that we see them nesting  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:20):**  in these swales.  And also after we harvest, then they still have that there.  We've been building ponds in the last also five or six years since we started with the  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:32):**  first one.  We have about 70 something or maybe 80 something already.  I lost a bit track of them.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:40):**  Some are quite small and they are these little dams that help a bit the weak parts of the  swales, but others are quite big that are almost one hectare of surface that they can  hold many thousand cubic meters of water.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:55):**  They're all great.  I like them all.  The little ones, the bigger ones.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:31:59):**  Some of them hold water all year round.  Some of them just only for a few days after strong rain events.  But they all are quite useful for biodiversity.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:12):**  Some are these little hotspots with vegetation and a bit more humid that for the summer for  a lot of these birds or rabbits that are breeding, they have a bit of a different vegetation  there and a bit of coverage.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:32:26):**  And yeah, the bigger ones and the ones that have water all year round, those are little  oases in this very arid place.  And then you see that they are really full of life in the summer and full of tracks and

And then thanks to a student that did some research, we found out that even a lot of  the insects that breed in the pond are also pollinators that are helping us with the almond

And yeah, the ponds, I think they are really helping a lot with the biodiversity.  It's not just providing water, but it's water, the plants around, it's shelter for breeding,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:11):**  it's little different habitats.  I was really amazed by the difference between the almonds that were tilled between one and  three times in a year and then the no-till almonds.

The no-till almonds were really struggling.  They were kind of much weaker, thinner trunks, and they were right next to each other, these

I have to admit that I was quite shocked when I saw all the bare soil and by the tilling  of the top 10 centimeters of soil between these nut trees.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:33:48):**  That bare earth goes against everything I've learned.  And when I touched the soil on the surface, it was brittle and dust-like, although going  down a few centimeters, there was much more moisture and better structured soil.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:02):**  Obviously that topsoil is still very fragile and could easily blow away in summer windstorms.  But in farming, there are always compromises.  And as Alfonso said, they are building carbon in the soil using their cover cropping in

It appears the soil isn't degrading as a whole.  So maybe for the early years of growing rain-fed almonds in drier areas, the top 10 centimeters

**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/67-fibre-farming-ugandan-permaculture-and-rain-fed-regeneration-in-spain#t=0:34:37):**  Or maybe there's something else we don't quite understand in this situation.  For me, this experience was a good reminder that there are no dogmas in regenerative approaches  to farming.

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  We are always in awe at the risks farmers and growers take on. This is not a quick gains  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:09):**  gain and changes or experimentation can take years of believing you are doing the right  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:14):**  thing with little or no agreement from those around you. We share in those learnings and  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:21):**  losses here on Farmerama, so thanks for giving your voices and thanks for listening.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:27):**  This month we hear from farmers who have gone against the grain to work with the landscapes  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:31):**  around them and we learn about how listening to the land has led to flourishing businesses.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:37):**  And we go volunteering with Hannah to learn about inner city school kids excitedly eating  
**[0:00:42-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:00:42):**  home grown carrots and how she's managed to keep them entertained by soil.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:04):**  So to kick us off we're sticking with kids. Goats are boundless creatures, they'll eat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:09):**  almost anything and sometimes everything and they're really entertaining to be around.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:15):**  Not always popular in the traditional British diet but that certainly seems to be changing.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:21):**  Gourmet Goats based in Borough Market in London recently won the best street food prize at  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:26):**  BBC Food and Farming Awards which we were at. And I wasn't there but you two were, good  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:32):**  time? So nice. Amazing, really good. I felt particularly inspired by the whole thing.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:39):**  Because every other awards ceremony I've ever been to I was a bit drained by the whole thing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:45):**  but this was energising to see all these people so humble being rewarded for all their years  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  of work and effort. Yeah a real celebration of amazing hard work and great food. And innovation,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:01:58):**  like most of the people there were really innovative in what they were doing. I particularly  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:03):**  liked that pub. It was a farm shop as well. Yeah so half of the pub they turned into a  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:10):**  farm shop. I just thought that was like, it made so much sense. And you know like the  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  local farmers they'll come in, they'll drop off their beetroot and then go and have a  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:19):**  beer. And I was like, how could no one have thought of that before? I think it's a model  
**[0:02:24-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:24):**  that could catch on. Definitely, it just made so much sense. And goat was on the menu. Yeah.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  It was a very tasty gourmet goat. Yeah, fantastic. Delicious. Delicious goat. Well now it's time  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  to hear from another farmer who's making a success of a farm built around goats. My name's  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:47):**  Ruth and I'm Harris Farm Meats for me and my five children. I have a small farm outside  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  Stave in South Lanarkshire and we produce Scottish boar goat and we rear traditional  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:02:57):**  and rear breed pigs and produce mutton and lamb. The goat meat's a fantastic meat. It's  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:06):**  not only extremely healthy, low in calories, low in cholesterol, high in vitamins, low  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:13):**  in fat but it's also immensely tasty. It's a beautiful meat and the boar goats originally  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:20):**  from South Africa produce a very tender, tasty meat. It's not in any way tough, it's not  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  in any way overpowering, it's just a beautiful, beautiful meat. What I did is I took about  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:33):**  two and a half years to find the right quality of boar goats and eventually found them and  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:38):**  started Harris Farm Meats. Working with goats, you do need to have a sense of humour. Goats  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:46):**  are funny, really, really funny. They have fantastic characters and they express themselves  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:52):**  in many, many ways. They talk to you, they talk to you by their actions and you need  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:03:58):**  to be able to read that. A good farmer for me must have compassion, must have compassion  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:04):**  for her animals and must be able to read them really well. I need to know when they're not  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:11):**  happy, when they're not well and also how to help them. Goats, they do talk to you very,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:19):**  they do talk to you very, very loudly. They've also got great characters and the end product  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  is they produce a very good, very good quality meat. I don't have a traditional farming background.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:32):**  I didn't go to agricultural college but I did learn my trade from very experienced farmers  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:36):**  and learned it as I experienced it. Every year as a young girl I used to go up to my  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:41):**  uncle's farm, my uncle David up in the Highlands. He had about 3,000 hill sheep and I'd go up  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:47):**  there for a shearing every year and I loved it. My uncle was so good to his animals and  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:52):**  he demanded that his workers totally respect the animals and for me that's the way the  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:04:57):**  animals should be kept. I plan to grow my business. I would like to start up a farm  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:04):**  shop. I've found that opening a farm at the weekend has been very successful. A lot of  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:09):**  people in Scotland want really good quality food. They want to know how it was kept, they  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:16):**  want to know what it was fed, where it came from and they want to, more often than not,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:22):**  and the most important thing is they want to know that that animal had the best, best  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:24):**  life and that's what I can give them. So I do have a lot of people out at the weekends  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:28):**  to see my animals and I welcome that. I want people to see where their animals came from  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:32):**  and the life they lived. My plans is to open a farm shop eventually and then eventually  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:39):**  down the line do an educational programme for people with special needs, basic animal  
**[0:05:47-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:47):**  husbandry and also animal therapy. I think animals are fantastic for people with different  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:05:56):**  support needs and I do have a background in that so I'd be looking to expand that. I got  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:02):**  a lot of help setting up the business. There is help out there, especially from other producers.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:07):**  Other producers do want to help you out. They will give you their experience and especially  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  small producers in Scotland, they want you to succeed. They want Scotland to succeed  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:19):**  as a small producer of very, very fine foods. Also the business gateway has been immensely  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:24):**  supportive. I know that I can phone them up and they'll do their very best to help me  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:31):**  out and give me the information I need. What I'd say to people who ask about goat meat,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:36):**  why eat goat meat and what does it taste like? Well goat meat tastes very different to different  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  people and obviously different cuts will taste slightly different. My most popular cut is  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  diced because it just lends itself to spices and oh it's so beautiful, tender and tasty  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:53):**  and really, really delicious. For me, some people say it tastes quite gamey, other people  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:06:58):**  say it's quite like lamb. For me, it tastes like lamb and the best roast beef you'll ever  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:05):**  have. So go out and try Scottish goat meat, it's fantastic and you will be helping a small  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:13):**  producer. One route to market for her produce is through Glasgow Food Assembly and it's  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  thanks to Geraldine Pitt, the Assembly host, that we have this interview. We'll have a  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  link to the food assembly on our Facebook. One of the multitude of growing related activities  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:31):**  our regular contributor Hannah is involved with is volunteering at a primary school in  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:36):**  Elliftonton Castle, South London. We hear from Hannah here as well as teachers Susie  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  Gregor and Rachel Fullwood and new contributor Alice Holden. They all come together to explain  
**[0:07:49-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  how the school get the children engaged with growing and thinking about food.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  I've been volunteering for just over a year. I thought it would be for six months but actually  
**[0:08:15-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:15):**  I like it so much that I want to try and keep coming. It's often the best part of my week.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:26):**  There's different bits. We visited the nursery garden and that was the first area that I  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:32):**  sort of reclaimed as it were and started to garden productively with flowers and vegetables.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:39):**  So each year I've taken on board another area or another bed. I really always like working  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:45):**  with people and I've got a real enthusiasm for growing so I thought maybe this is a good  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:50):**  idea to share that and particularly with children but going and watching teachers do their thing  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:08:55):**  and keep control of a class and keep them engaged was a big eye opener for me so I've  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:02):**  been learning a lot from them. Most of them don't have gardens. If they do have gardens  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:09):**  it doesn't mean to say that they garden in them but the majority haven't got gardens.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:14):**  So they do appreciate it and I dare I say I think the children notice more than the  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:18):**  adults.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  They've been getting taller, they've been getting flowers. Now look at the baby poppies.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:24):**  Don't snatch because there's not enough for everyone to try. So if one or three people  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:29):**  try then a lot of people have got to miss out. I don't think it's fair. You're all going  
**[0:09:32-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  to get a chance to do it. Can we appreciate the cuteness please?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:42):**  I've got a new found respect for teachers I'd say. I definitely thought it would be  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  easier than it is and I also came at it in a way that I thought yeah I'm going to get  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:52):**  them so excited so I'd be like guys this is rainbow chart isn't it amazing and then they  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:09:57):**  go yeah and run around the playground and then I'd be like guys guys come back we need  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  to learn about the chart and cut it so I kind of had to learn down to like tone that down.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:09):**  There's gardening club which happens every Wednesday. That's after school and then now  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:14):**  all the year groups have their own planters so they all have an opportunity to engage  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:21):**  in gardening in their own little plot as it were and the teachers plan those activities  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:27):**  and they have to plan one every half term so that's part of our curriculum now.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:34):**  Do children connect with growing up with eating? They certainly do in gardening club because  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:40):**  they pick it and they take it home and then they'll always say oh can I eat it now can  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  I eat it raw or do I have to cook it do I have to wash it so I definitely think they  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:49):**  do and I think that is developing. I think if they saw a tin of sweetcorn they might  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  not necessarily make the connections but that is developing and certainly with the older  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:10:58):**  children very much so.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:01):**  What happens to the produce? Well at the moment it's taken home generally and the aim is I  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:08):**  mean each year we've taken on board something new so we're probably in about our eighth  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:13):**  year I would say so the next thing is that we are actually in this room going to have  
**[0:11:20-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:20):**  a kitchen installed so it's going to go back to us having cooks here and food being cooked  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:29):**  on the premises so once we're there although we do not have the acres that are needed to  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:37):**  provide fruit and vegetables for a kitchen to feed a large primary school like this we  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  will be able to start putting stuff into the kitchens.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  Farmers have had to diversify their farms to survive financially and actually I'm seeing  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:55):**  it more and more often that actually maybe young farmers coming into this it's so hard  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:11:59):**  to earn a living from farming alone that they have to diversify their skill sets as well  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:04):**  and it's great if you can have it all centered around growing but sometimes you have to think  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:10):**  outside the box rather than being a farmer the whole time.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:13):**  I do loads of different jobs they're all centered around growing but some of them are doing  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:18):**  media things, teaching, training, growing, working in schools I'm keen to try as many  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:25):**  different things as possible but I feel like you have to be an entrepreneur now if you  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:29):**  want to get into growing which is cool because it suits me and I'm in but it's difficult  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:35):**  as well.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:36):**  I've heard farmers say similar things about yeah keeping their farms going you know starting  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:41):**  other businesses alongside so you have to be able to diversify your income streams as  
**[0:12:48-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:48):**  well.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:12:59):**  Creepy Corleys is always a mixed thing some love them and some scream but one thing I  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:05):**  would definitely say since we have been gardening with more of a variety of flora and we've  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:13):**  had more insects coming in the children are less screamy than they used to be and it's  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:18):**  less of oh everything's a fly.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:21):**  You know we've started to sort of say oh well actually that's not a fly that one's a bee  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:25):**  that one's a wasp that one's a yeah so it's their karma.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:33):**  I have asked a few of the kids as I'm sort of like doing jobs and they all enjoy the  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:38):**  garden I'm going to say all the majority they do notice the different flowers they notice  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:43):**  vegetables growing in strange places you know they appreciate the variety and there's just  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:50):**  so much to look at.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:52):**  Every week they'll come out with something that I you know haven't even thought about  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:13:56):**  they notice things they're excited about things and just I really love it when they become  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:02):**  like competent and they just casually walk past oh yes carrot you know no big deal and  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:07):**  I just think if we want people to care about you know the future then this is a great way  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:14):**  to start because I just don't think people care about plant skills that much even though  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:21):**  we need plants to live in a major way food oxygen you know flood prevention is critical  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:27):**  to the future but people consider it just like a I don't know a nicer side if you can  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:34):**  be good like with plants.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:38):**  Thank you to everybody at John Ruskin primary school for showing us around and thanks to  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:42):**  Alice who recorded these interviews.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:44):**  Alice is the lead grower at Dagenham Farm and we'll be hearing more from her over the  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:49):**  coming months.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:51):**  And now for something a little different we have some recordings from a poetry competition  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  which has got people thinking creatively about the food they eat.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  The slam was run by Hammer and Tongue Bristol in partnership with Bristol Food Connections.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:05):**  Here's Sarah McCready with a poem about roast dinners and the people you eat meals with  
**[0:15:10-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:10):**  and thanks to Jane Kilpatrick who sent in these this recording.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  Wallace and Gromit went to the moon just for some cheese and I followed them and I've seen  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  my past my present my future in a chicken nugget.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:43):**  Age six and not much older baby skin and frakkled shoulders licking ice cream in the shape and  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:48):**  watching in wonder as it pools in the crease of my arm.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:15:53):**  Twenty something in high risers and terraced houses hot ready meal slops on a cold plate.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:01):**  Even I'm old as hell rocking chair on a drowsy doorstep still appreciating the simplicity  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:09):**  the ice particle symphony of a mini milk.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:16):**  Fat burritos pink juice pulp hot dog sweat swallowing music with a packet of quavers  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:24):**  cheeseburgers and relish on knuckles walks home a cradling hot chips like they were your  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:30):**  first born.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:32):**  Candy floss your teeth sends into nothing and chilling in Bristol with a blueberry muffin  
**[0:16:39-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:39):**  finding paradise in a back alley with a stuffy nose and curry house spices.  
**[0:16:47-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:16:47):**  Wallace and Gromit went to the moon just for some cheese and I followed them.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:17):**  John and Joanna Cherry are farmers who have embarked on an ambitious no-till herbal lay  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:23):**  and mob grazing experiment on their farm inspired by books such as Grass Soil Hope by Courtney  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:29):**  White and by visits to pioneers of these techniques in the United States.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:36):**  This combination of methods has allowed them to move away from conventional high input  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:41):**  farming to running a farm where the fields are flourishing soils regenerating and running  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:46):**  at a profit for the first time in years.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:50):**  I joined John along with the Future Farm Lab team and his herd of course for a tour of  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:56):**  some of his fields.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:17:58):**  Well they've never seen so many people they're very excited.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah we ploughed this field for 20 years and it got progressed well we've been I mean we  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:12):**  ploughed it for 20 years it's been ploughed for hundreds of years before that.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:16):**  It just got a little bit worse it was horrible yellow clay and it got a bit worse more difficult  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:23):**  every year and we didn't think there's anything we could do about it we thought we had to  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  keep ploughing it.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:28):**  You just got more bigger and bigger machines to break it down after the ploughing and planting  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:32):**  the crop and the crops got worse and worse.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:34):**  Hopefully we've broken the cycle now by not disturbing it and the soil organic matter's  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  getting in there and the soil's getting darker and which is a good sign that there's carbon  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:47):**  being locked up in it and it's getting much more water attentive and manageable and full  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  of worm holes and yeah getting better all the time.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:18:57):**  We like it.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:04):**  This field was full of black grass and it's very much lacking organic matter so we put  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:09):**  it into this herbal lei three years ago and we put this very rudimentary fence around  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:17):**  and a kind of temporary water tank in and then we've been mob grazing it the cattle  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:22):**  were in here about two weeks ago those ones we've just seen and just took the top off  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:27):**  it and then we'll let it grow off again and that's this chicory will grow sort of six  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:34):**  feet tall and be covered in blue flowers that looks fantastic.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  Do you ever harvest the chicory?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:40):**  Well the cows do it for us.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  In mob grazing a method that was made popular by Ellen Savery you can use electric fencing  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:52):**  or temporary fencing to keep animals in specific parts of the field.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:19:58):**  This practice mimics how animals would behave out in the wild on vast grasslands but it  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:04):**  doesn't come without its challenges.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:08):**  In this climate the grass spends all winter not growing and then it suddenly starts growing  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:14):**  in March April time and about this time of year it does maximum grow come about June  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:19):**  July it stops growing and then you have another little dip in another little peak in September  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:26):**  time you get the autumn rains.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  So it's all about managing that uneven wave of growth so that you've got food for them  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:38):**  all year round and they don't grow they don't grow quite as quickly as animals that get  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:45):**  a bit of grain in their diet.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:47):**  So some of the two-year-old ones like that black one are really quite small when they  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:20:52):**  carve but they're, oh do shut up.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:00):**  What is it?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  So I mean I think it's all about just looking at what your ground does what happens in your  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  climate and adapting it.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:13):**  There's no point trying to fight nature you just want to go with it.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:17):**  There's no real C4 plants but native here so but it's an opportunity.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  This grain would have been sprayed before we drilled it we've round up to kill any weeds  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:37):**  and volunteer weed coming up and I think that's probably it.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  It's had some fertilizer and that's it.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:45):**  This is a major challenge of no-till how to remove the cover crop before you plant the  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:50):**  beans or wheat or whatever.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:53):**  As you heard John currently uses weed killer.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:56):**  There is no clear answer to this conundrum.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  Most organic farmers still till the soil to avoid this issue but not tilling the soil  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:06):**  can return lots of fertility and trap beneficial carbon in the soil.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:11):**  We're on the cusp of so many exciting things happening in farming and it's like the tendency  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:17):**  is to be miserable as hell because everybody wants things to change without them having  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:23):**  to make any changes.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:25):**  Most farmers stop farming you know now they physically do it but someone else tells them  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:32):**  what to do the whole time and they get a menu of this is you know you plant this on this  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:38):**  in between these two dates and then you spray it with this and then you spray it with that  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:41):**  and then you apply some fertilizer you spray it with something else then you combine it  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:45):**  when it's ready and you sell it to this person over here.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:48):**  What I find exciting about John is that he was a conventional farmer but has gradually  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  moved away from using chemicals and artificial inputs towards more natural and agro-ecological  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:22:59):**  methods.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  It's understandable that many farmers running on tight margins to support their families  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:05):**  are hesitant to make the jump into the unknown.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:08):**  Joanna talked us through her experience.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  When the accountant came to do the which they do end of year accounts he's really cynical  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:17):**  about this whole no-till business.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:19):**  He kept saying I don't understand actually you are in the top say five percent of farmers  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:24):**  in the country in terms of making money but it's just because there's so few costs because  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  the costs are so low because of the lack of chemical sprays the lack of diesel being used  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:35):**  and all the rest of it and machinery being up kept and all the rest of it and so he then  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:41):**  realized that this was actually financially viable.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:45):**  It was a year when a lot of people had made a lot more had had a lot higher yields who'd  
**[0:23:50-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:50):**  been plowing and their farm wasn't and this farm wasn't yet getting such high yields and  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:23:59):**  so it they had assumed it was going to be a bad year for profits and so everybody was  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:04):**  surprised and the farmer kept saying oh this is just probably a blip and almost certainly  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:11):**  this won't carry on and then last year when he came back he had to say again well actually  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  I don't quite understand why this is the case but it looks as though again it's working  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  rather well for you but it might not work next year.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:25):**  It immediately made John very positive because it made it much easier to convince other people  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:30):**  so people who farm in the next door farms are also have gone no till as a result of  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:36):**  this yes so it because that does speak to farmers I mean the bottom line is what people  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:42):**  are interested in because they don't want to take risks there really is a profit aspect  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:47):**  to this which which makes it sensible to do irrespective of any kind of other reasons.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:24:55):**  John and Joanna have put together an all day event, Grantswell on June 30th on their farm  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:00):**  in Hertfordshire so fellow farmers and the public can come and see for themselves.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:06):**  Yes so the Grantswell show is it started off as an idea of just getting all the people  
**[0:25:12-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:12):**  who are doing no till together for a celebration and sharing ideas and exploring new ideas  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:21):**  new ways of doing things but also it's an opportunity for people who are thinking of  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:27):**  getting into of changing their system and giving them the opportunity to find out how  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:35):**  to do it and to see us making a meal of what we do and have a look at land that's been  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:41):**  in no till because a lot of people never come across it I'm just very excited about it  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:46):**  and I'm very grateful to the people who showed us what they were doing and we're just passing  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:52):**  that joy on to anybody else who's interested.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:25:59):**  And so the daytime events will all be geared towards active farmers and in the evening  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  we've got a Charles Dowding who's a great no dig gardening specialist to talk to any  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:09):**  local gardeners who want to experiment with not digging their garden but growing just  
**[0:26:14-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:14):**  as many things and Jill Clapperton the great soil scientist from America will be explaining  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:24):**  to non-farmers the benefits of all these ways of looking after the soil to the planet and  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:31):**  to their food and to the future of farming and all the possibilities for hopefully any  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:37):**  any members of the public can come along to that.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:42):**  So thanks Abby for that report.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:46):**  Nigel what do you think about this till till when would could you be tempted to jump on  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:53):**  the no till bandwagon?  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:55):**  Yes in short I think I think it's something that we'd love to try on the farm.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:26:59):**  So then what about adding in this mob grazing aspect because you obviously have cows and  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:03):**  sheep on your land would you ever consider taking that honour why haven't you adopted  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:08):**  it yet?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:09):**  Well from you know farms I visited where they're implementing mob grazing they've seen you  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:15):**  know big a big increase in the sort of productivity of the grass like the lays coming back stronger  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:22):**  and just generally you know producing more grass from the same area of land so it kind  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  of seems a no-brainer really.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:31):**  And why now why is this stuff getting attention now why has this not been done 10 years ago  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:38):**  20 years ago like a hundred years ago what is it about this current moment that that  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:43):**  we're hearing more and more of people talking about both of these techniques?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:48):**  You know in the last whatever 60 70 years high input farming became the norm and so  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:54):**  people were putting loads of nitrogen fertilizers on their fields and just using every chemical  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  possible because it was producing high yields and it seemed to be making more money but  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:04):**  then in the last I don't know how long maybe 20 25 30 years that's been on the decline  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:12):**  and people are actually getting lower yields from their land and they're having to pay  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:16):**  for these high inputs still and not getting the same rewards.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:19):**  Broken the soil.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:22):**  Really ravaged the earth and need to look to something new and what I think is interesting  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:28):**  about John is that he you know he's not organic so he hasn't got you know he doesn't have  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:36):**  that aspect to what he's doing but he's taken some steps that really are helping to become  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:43):**  more agroecological in his ways and for me that's inspiring to see conventional farmers  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:48):**  moving across because 95% of farmers in the UK are conventional so that to me is really  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:55):**  exciting.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:28:56):**  So can we get a commitment from you to follow the journey on Farmer Long over the next.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:02):**  Yeah I think in the next six to twelve months we could we could pilot something.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:09):**  That's cool.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:10):**  That would be really cool to follow the journey.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:13):**  With our Sussex cattle I think yeah that'd be quite well suited to it.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:19):**  Now to close the show we have another poem from the Bristol Poetry Slam.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:23):**  All the recordings you've heard today are part of a national competition leading up  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:28):**  to a final at the Royal Albert Hall and to find out more head to our Facebook page where  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:32):**  we'll have the links to everybody who is involved.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:36):**  We'll be back next month but until then here's Danny Pandolfi to send us off with his experience  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:42):**  of giving up meat.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:45):**  So I stopped eating meat.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:46):**  Thought it was the right time.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:47):**  Thought if I tried it might not be so hard.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:48):**  When you've been forced to give up the things you love in the past that choice can be liberating.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:29:58):**  So I consider waiting but sizzling bacon.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:03):**  That smell was a meat permeates everything even permeates has meat in it but I'll sit  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:09):**  a dead man and I'm eating it.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:10):**  I want to feel the same when spring rolls into summer and in case there isn't long to  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:15):**  go I want to know what's best.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:17):**  They say it's like going from solid gold to monochromes instead but I'm not push over  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:22):**  and now it's like I'm on a roll with veg I take out one then goes the rest like the domino  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:26):**  effect.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:27):**  I try to pervade this life with meat from frying steaks to dicing beef it's like a game  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:32):**  of hide and seek inside of James's giant peach but then I like the taste.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:36):**  It's kind to me.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:37):**  Not quite the same but nice and sweet lost my weight and I'm flying free those frightened  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:41):**  states inside me leave which got me thinking about the wider issues in this and why the  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:47):**  issues persist.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:48):**  Can we change belief systems like diet plans with the speediness that lightning can see  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:30:54):**  the easiness of climate plans and greediness of private lands.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:00):**  Change elitism is just like ingredients in frying pans.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:04):**  So now how will I feel if I gave up the fight as I think of all those great people who gave  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:09):**  up their rights and the comparatively few things I gave up in life but then just a few  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:13):**  months ago I almost gave up on life and ever since and I've been looking for a purpose  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:18):**  and a reason searching for a meaning in the earth and in its creatures not that person  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:22):**  here for preaching on the perks of being vegan no not a sermon or a teaching this is personal  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:28):**  watching.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:29):**  Sometimes it takes one strike to make mountain steps ironic when you give up some rights  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:35):**  you can take down what's left and as I think of collectivism no bizarre how there's no  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:41):**  iron man like Tony Stark.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:43):**  Feminism, Sir Wunder of Wild Wurst and Kraft, Joan of Arc and Rosa Parks how none of them  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:47):**  ever gave a stone to cost whether the length of a shoulder run we've kept them to poles  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:53):**  apart we treat them golden keep them close to our chest like a poker card.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:31:57):**  Food and mind the two combined two things I've struggled with through my life.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:04):**  People ask me are you joking me?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:07):**  You don't behave like you ain't coping great plus you ain't fat or skinny I said you can  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:11):**  be low on shape without being overweight plus mentality governs and controls your states  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:16):**  I was given dominion over the meats but for what spiritual meaning?  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:20):**  Because remember there's an opposite in every biblical teaching morale and morals are intrinsically  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:26):**  linked in the choices we make and the things that we're eating and I realized 40 days of  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:31):**  fasting isn't 40 days of starving this isn't biblical.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:34):**  You can desert an extra meal and leave the devil crossed is that I?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:38):**  Cyanide should be mounting strategies to get to God which lends me the ease to give up  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:42):**  and strength to stop to write freely and not allow this pen to cost and can spirituality  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/10-farmerama#t=0:32:47):**  link to animals eaten?

## California drought, Sheep under vines and the beginning of Fibershed  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama. We haven't said that in a while. We hope you enjoyed  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:07):**  the recent Cultivating Justice series and then our bonus shorts where we featured different  
**[0:00:11-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:11):**  millers from our series Cereal. We've just celebrated our seventh birthday. Seven years  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:19):**  of sharing the voices of the regenerative farming movement. We want to take a moment  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:24):**  to thank everyone who's been part of Farmerama episodes in that time. To the farmers producing  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:29):**  food and fibre for us whilst rejuvenating the ecosystems they're working in. This month  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:34):**  we hear how one ranch is managing to build green cover in its 22nd year of drought in  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:39):**  California and about the vineyard they've designed to allow for grazing sheep below  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:43):**  the canopy all year round. And we learn about the roots of the Fibershed movement, again  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:48):**  in California, ahead of the release of our upcoming mini-series Farming Fashion from  
**[0:00:54-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:54):**  Fibershed UK.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:09):**  Sally Calhoun owns and manages the Piscinez Ranch. She's also an impact investor, activist  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:15):**  and philanthropic funder in regenerative agriculture. She shared with us some signs of hope in the  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:20):**  drought-stricken area of the world in which she lives.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:24):**  So the ranch is about 7600 acres. There is the San Benito River which is a very seasonal  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:30):**  small river, runs through it. We have about seven miles of meandering that kind of splits  
**[0:01:35-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:35):**  the ranch in half. We're in a very low rainfall area in the midst so far of 22 years of drought.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:43):**  So we usually get between three and ten inches of rain a year and sometimes less these days.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:52):**  So when we arrived on the ranch, I was very interested in regenerating both the California  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:58):**  perennial grasses and also the riparian corridor. The riparian corridor had historically been  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:02):**  used to graze 500 cows from the middle of June until the middle of December and it was  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:08):**  basically dust. So we really are starting in around 2004, we immediately fenced the  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:13):**  river so it would not be grazed all the time, stopped utilizing it in that way and then  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:18):**  have progressively adopted holistic planned grazing. So the river has been grazed almost  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:24):**  every year for the last 20 years and what we've seen is really a regeneration of the  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:29):**  riparian corridor. We were very optimistic. We have a lot of willows and mule fat and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:33):**  all kinds of salt grass creeping while dry. Very interesting things happening and we thought  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:38):**  it was good and last year we spoke to some restoration biologists to see if we could  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:44):**  get some mitigation credit or some credit for the ongoing river restoration and they  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:49):**  said you're pretty much finished. So it's super cool that by just changing the way we  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:54):**  manage the grazing in 20 years of drought but with a river, so there is a lot of water,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:01):**  but we really didn't plant a single plant. We didn't have a plan about what should grow  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:06):**  here or what should grow there. We said we'll see what the river and the land and nature  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:11):**  give us and it's super cool what we've got now. I mean they figure that 95% of the riparian  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:17):**  corridors in California have been destroyed, usually because they're on the floodplains  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:21):**  and they're a really good place to farm, right? So it makes sense that they got destroyed.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:26):**  But we were told this is the only corridor like this on the Central Coast anywhere and  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:32):**  if you fly from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, it is so obvious when you fly over this corridor  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:38):**  because it is by far the largest thing like it that you'll see in that whole trip. So  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:44):**  yeah, we're super psyched about it. I wish we had done some analysis and figured out  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:47):**  how much carbon we've sequestered. So maybe we'll figure out how much carbon is there  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:50):**  now and they'll tell us something anyway. When we got here, I didn't know anything but  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:55):**  I was introduced to Alan Savery's work and I'd been growing California native perennial  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:01):**  bunch grasses in my backyard for 15 years and was intrigued by the idea they might be  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:05):**  able to come back here because they're viewed as being mostly extinct in California rangeland.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:10):**  And in fact, when we got here, we could not find a single cool season California bunch  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:13):**  grass anywhere. We did finally find some very sad looking ones on north facing slopes. So  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:19):**  we knew they were here. Here in California, it's painful because you have to assume that  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:24):**  they're there and graze accordingly even if you can't see them, which is kind of frustrating.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:29):**  But we did that. We assumed that they were here and with pretty minor improvements in  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:35):**  grazing like just less over grazing, we began to see pretty dramatic returns of the purple  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:41):**  needle grass in particular. That's the one that's really come back. And the other one  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:44):**  is the salt grass, which is a C4 grass, a warm season grass, the only one left here.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:49):**  Its resurgence has also been pretty dramatic. It's kind of come out of the river and is  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:53):**  heading upslope. So yeah, it just seems like if you just take your foot off their necks,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:01):**  it's amazing what can happen even in such a low rainfall place with really degraded  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:05):**  soils and a totally crashed ecosystem. So sitting as a person who's 22 years into this  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:13):**  giant drought, I mean, it just really, I sometimes think I'm so sad about with this change in  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:19):**  management if it kept raining, what might have been, which we'll never know. So I don't  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:24):**  know over the next 10 to 20 years, if the rainfall stays down at three inches, five  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:28):**  inches a year, I don't know that a lot is going to change to be perfectly honest. And  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:31):**  we know we have not increased soil organic matter. And we have increased biodiversity  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:38):**  and we'll keep working as hard as we can at increasing biodiversity. But I'm really struck  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:42):**  by the realization that if it doesn't rain, it's very hard to improve or to create any  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:49):**  change in the system. So I'm optimistic that the great flood will come. And then I think  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:54):**  if it would rain, we would be totally astonished at what would happen. I think we have no idea  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:00):**  what could happen, but it just takes water. My joke is that if it just stops raining,  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:06):**  we'll put in solar panels and we'll mine the 500-year sand and gravel pit. It'll be about  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:11):**  sun and sand if it just doesn't rain anymore. It's important to have a backup plan in the  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:16):**  21st century. We need functioning ecosystems. That's the goal here at this point. We've  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:24):**  just got to have them all over the planet. We should manage every square foot of the  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:27):**  planet to sequester carbon and create functioning ecosystems.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:33):**  Kelly Mulville is vineyard director at Pisoners Ranch, where he's planted a vineyard that  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:38):**  looks a little different. Originally trained in holistic management, Kelly's designed a  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:43):**  vineyard that allows for animals to graze in it all year round.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:51):**  The first thing that most people notice with the vineyard is that it is a tall trellis.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:56):**  So we're using a system called the Watson system developed by a retired petroleum engineer  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:01):**  in Texas. And it actually was not developed, designed for sheep. It was rather designed  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:07):**  for climates that are very hot and humid to help prevent the mildew and make it easier  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:14):**  to manage in those situations. But when I saw that trellis system, I realized that that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:20):**  would probably work very well for sheep. And so one of the aspects of our design is we  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:25):**  wanted sheep to be able to do most of the work for us. I had done a trial of a vineyard  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:29):**  in Sonoma County where I set it up to graze throughout the growing season. And we had  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:34):**  some really dramatic results in water savings and labor savings and fertility benefits.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:40):**  And so the next step was actually to design something from the get go that we could graze  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:45):**  without having to do so much modifications. So the idea with this is that we have a trellis  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:51):**  system that enables grazing throughout the growing season of the grapevines as well as  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:58):**  during the dormant season. And so in order to do that, we have to raise the trellis system  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:04):**  up so that it's out of reach of the sheep, the important parts, the fruiting zone and  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:09):**  the shoots. But we also want them to do our suckering forest, which are the shoots that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:13):**  come out at the base of the vine and along the trunk. And we want them to do our shoot  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:18):**  tipping forest as well. So those are the shoots that hang over, they grow up and then they  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:22):**  hang over and come back into range of the sheep. And so most of those tasks are generally  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:27):**  done by machine or human labor. So we have that designed so that the sheep will do that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:33):**  just through their browsing practices. So the first thing people notice is that the  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:38):**  trellis is higher. The vines, it's a partial overhead, it's a V trellis. And so that provides  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:44):**  about the row spacing is 12 feet and those vines are six feet apart. Once those vines  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:50):**  are full, they take up about probably five to six feet of the row in a partial overhead  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:57):**  canopy, which allows dappled light and good exposure to air and partial exposure to the  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:05):**  sun. So it's almost like being in a small orchard rather than a vineyard. And so the  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:12):**  fruit is up higher and the vines are up higher and it has a different feel than when the  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:17):**  vines are in rows or in their head trains on close to the ground. So sheep are a critical  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:23):**  part of our management in this vineyard. And actually before we even planted, we were using  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:28):**  what is called holistic plan grazing. Some people refer to it as mob or intensive grazing.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:33):**  And what that means is we keep the animals bunched up fairly tightly and they move very  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:40):**  often so that we're not over grazing or over trampling the site. And having the vineyard  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:46):**  high like this, including our drip water is high as well. So both humans and sheep can  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:51):**  go any direction in the vineyard and they're not restricted to just the row itself. And  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:56):**  that enables freedom of access. And it also makes it easier for us to set up temporary  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:03):**  fencing inside the vineyard. If we want to have a higher impact of animals for a shorter  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:07):**  period of time, then we can have a very small paddock and it isn't necessarily restricted  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:12):**  to just one or two rows to do that. So that offers a lot more flexibility and we are running  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:19):**  sheep in the vineyard during, a lot of it depends on rainfall. We're in a very low rainfall  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:25):**  area, about 12 inches a year is the historic average. The past two years we've had about  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:30):**  five inches, so we're in a pretty good drought. And so the amount of grazing is dictated by  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:35):**  the amount of rainfall we get. And we are in a Mediterranean climate, so we get the  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:42):**  rains starting in the typical rainy season would be October through the end of April  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:48):**  or so. Our rainy season seems to be shrinking with the drought, but that allows us to graze  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:54):**  during the non-growing season. We can graze sheep in the vineyards and we don't have to  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:57):**  worry about the vines at that time. And then during the growing season of the vines or  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:01):**  summer we can graze as well. But because we don't get rainfall in the summer, that means  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:07):**  that the flock is generally smaller. And typically we're just using the rams. Our flock here  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:14):**  is about 2000 sheep, so we have somewhere around 25, 30 rams. And that's a good number  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:21):**  for grazing the, kind of quickly through the vineyard during the summer season, because  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:26):**  there's just not much vegetation. Most of the vegetation is under the vines themselves.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:31):**  The initial goal of this was to create an agricultural system that encourages biodiversity  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:37):**  and builds biodiversity back into the ecosystem. Most agriculture actually reduces biodiversity,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:44):**  sometimes really severely, to basically one crop and all insects and most life is kept  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:50):**  out of farming systems. And so we wanted to do the exact opposite. And I was a bit inspired  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:56):**  by something Aldo Leopold said in that when we restore ecosystems, we may use some of  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:01):**  the same tools that we use to destroy them. And that's just, so you just have to change  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:06):**  your mindset on how you're using those tools. Animals, for instance. So we're using livestock,  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:10):**  to overgraze and over trample and create erosion and reduce biodiversity. We're using them  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:15):**  for the opposite reason, because the grazing practices that we are using basically mimic  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:21):**  natural grazing animals in a ecosystem that includes predators. The idea of this is that  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:29):**  basically, we're testing all of our decisions, our management decisions, our design decisions,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:36):**  and saying, will this increase biodiversity or will it reduce it? And so that means we're  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:43):**  not doing tillage, we're keeping the soils covered. We're using all of the soil health  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:46):**  principles plus some additional ones. We have a page that we've put together of principles  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:51):**  that we're working on, working with that allow us to achieve these goals. And one of the  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:58):**  things in order to verify this is we're doing a lot of monitoring. So we're monitoring soil  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:03):**  health, soil biology. We're monitoring insect populations, insect communities. We're monitoring  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:09):**  bird populations, plant species. And obviously we're monitoring things like a normal vineyard  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:17):**  would do, like your wine quality. And so that's all of that has led us to some interesting  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:23):**  results. We're seeing a lot of benefits in all of those areas. All of those areas are  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:28):**  good, but one of the really exciting things that happened this year is we had an endangered  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:31):**  species that's endemic to California show up. We've always had a few of these birds  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:38):**  called the tricolor blackbird. And this year we ended up having a large breeding colony.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:43):**  We had about a flock of 800 birds that were working in the vineyard every day and they  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:48):**  were nesting just below the vineyard in a small pond that we have. And so that was very  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:54):**  exciting for us. And it was also exciting for a lot of the folks that are watching this  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:58):**  bird and trying to figure out how do we stop the decline of it. So that apparently they  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:02):**  found the vineyard an exciting place to be. And that was a real affirmation that we're  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:08):**  on the right track. One of the things that I really appreciate in having worked with  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:15):**  a number of ranchers and farmers and farmed myself is that when you do the right thing,  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:23):**  you get unintended benefits. And when you do the wrong thing, you get unintended negative  
**[0:14:31-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:31):**  consequences. And so we are seeing a lot of sometimes expected benefits and sometimes  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:39):**  things that we totally did not expect. For instance, the increase in bird population.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:44):**  We didn't expect that we would have an endangered species that would fall in love with a vineyard  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:48):**  and park itself here. So we had hoped to increase some bird species, so that was definitely  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:54):**  an unintended benefit. The other things we're seeing is that the overhead trellis, as you  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:01):**  mentioned, does provide shade. And it provides shade in a large portion of the vineyard.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:06):**  So what we are seeing is that we are creating resiliency in the face of climate change.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:11):**  And so being higher up from the ground means we're cooler. We have a microclimate that's  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:19):**  cooler than being close to the soil. And oftentimes, vineyards have been planted low, specifically  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:24):**  so they could be warmer in cooler climates. So we're a warm to hot climate, so we don't  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:30):**  need things to get any warmer. And things are going towards the hot direction for us,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:35):**  for sure. So having the trellis, the canopy up high helps provide shade, provides shade  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:40):**  for people when you're harvesting, provides shade for the animals when they're in their  
**[0:15:44-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:44):**  grazing. And it's also providing habitat for things like insect eating birds, for spiders.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:52):**  And so it's expanding the habitat niches for a lot of life. We are also seeing that  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:00):**  in addition to making it cooler in the hot season, it's helping to prevent frost damage  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:05):**  when we get frost. And we used to not experience frost here to the lateness that we are right  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:10):**  now anyway. We've had frost as late as towards the end of May. And those have been very damaging  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:16):**  to the vines, the young vines that are still on the ground. But those vines that are up  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:21):**  on the trellis, we might see a little frost burn, but we're not getting any serious damage.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:28):**  So that is helping us mitigate this climate change, which brings both heat and cold in  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:34):**  extremes. So that is helping us in that way. And so those are just a couple of examples  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:40):**  of things that we're seeing that we're not necessarily... I'd kind of thought maybe that  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:46):**  it might be helpful for frost, but not to the extent that we're seeing. It's pretty

**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:56):**  things that we have been experimenting with over the past two years is having an internship  
**[0:17:00-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:00):**  program. And that has been a fascinating experience, learning experience for all of us. And it's  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:08):**  great having younger people at the vineyard who are very passionate about what we're doing,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:16):**  because we have not figured out everything yet. We have a lot to learn. We're just scraping  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:20):**  the surface here. And so bringing young folks that are interested in this on this journey  
**[0:17:25-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:25):**  with us and sending them out there to do what they... take what they've learned from here  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:33):**  and what they learned from other places too, and expand on this is I think a great opportunity  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:40):**  of sharing or learning and learning from each other, because the learning definitely goes  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:45):**  both ways. And so that has been another fun and sometimes challenging aspect, I'm sure  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:51):**  for both sides, that is happening here.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:55):**  Rebecca Burgess is an indigo farmer, author and community organizer. She's the executive

**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:17):**  was ample raw material being grown to support a regional textile economy rooted in climate

**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:34):**  What inspired me to start Fibershed was that I had already initiated a project to establish  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:42):**  a one year wardrobe challenge for myself, working with fibers and dyes and community  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:47):**  members to generate something I would wear over the course of a year. And after that  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:54):**  year, which had been successful, there was there was more fiber than I knew what to do  
**[0:18:59-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:59):**  with and incredible natural dye palette, incredibly talented community. I realized that there  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:07):**  was more to this that might even end up looking like a new regional economic lens to evaluate  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:14):**  our community through because most of the clothes, if not, probably close to 100% of  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:20):**  clothing in our community is imported. And it has very little to no transparency. I mean,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:27):**  now it's getting better. Small and medium brands are really pushing the edges on and  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:33):**  even a couple of big brands are trying but I felt like there was this need to codify  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:39):**  the value system in something more structural than just in personal endeavor. So that's  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:45):**  when the community who had already participated in the one year wardrobe challenge, they also  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:51):**  started to participate in the board of directors and the structure to define the org came a  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:57):**  lot from from their input. I just went did all the legal work and got pro bono help and  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:05):**  and set it up as an org that would yes, evaluate the future of economic regional economic sovereignty,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:12):**  fiber sovereignty, you know, what does it mean to be able to process our own materials  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:17):**  in ways that allow us to provide for our communities.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:24):**  I think a global advocacy is the opportunity. I think being able to say, from a series of  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:31):**  grassroots organizers who work in these food fiber, natural medicine, I mean, everything  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:38):**  the land, everything that comes from and yields from healthy productive landscapes, all of  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:44):**  us who are part and parcel of those processes, carbon, we're part of the carbon cycle and  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:52):**  we acknowledge it. What is reparative justice look like for the communities that we have  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:59):**  forced to become the means of production, some in some cases against their will, you  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:04):**  know, tearing people out of their traditional culture to become means of production for  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:09):**  Western culture, which is what fast fashion has done. Now that you've concentrated all  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:14):**  those women primarily in these huge sewing factories from Vietnam to Bangladesh to Myanmar,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:22):**  and China has pretty much moved cut and sew out of their country. But how do you, and  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:28):**  Ethiopia is now a new landscape for exploitation, what is the just transition? How do we as  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:33):**  fiber shed organizers reach out to the communities that have been so imperiled by fast fashion  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:40):**  and say, we're taking responsibility, we've always needed to, we're doing that, but we  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:45):**  know that you got caught in a conundrum that we got caught in too, but you have more to  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:50):**  lose because this is your, this is everything to keep your family going. So I think we have  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:55):**  to address reparative justice in this transition. It's so interesting to see the achievements  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:01):**  to me on community organizing, which is an achievement in itself to be a community organizer  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:06):**  and actually say you can call something something because you've invested your time and attention  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:11):**  into getting people to work towards something together. That's an achievement and that that's  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:17):**  happening globally is awesome. And there's a beauty that it's also happening in primarily  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:22):**  it's happening in Canada, the United States, Australia, Britain, somewhat in the North  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:28):**  Atlantic, a little bit in Central and Southern Europe. But it's happening in countries that  
**[0:22:35-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:35):**  are my, it's interesting, it's my own ancestry. So my family is originally Irish, Welsh, it's  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:44):**  Scandinavian, but you know, the, the, the, the islands, the North Atlantic islands is  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:50):**  where we're from. And to watch it kind of birth out of these locations, it feels, I  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:54):**  mean, if I were to go very personal, it feels like a healing of a very long ancestral line  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:00):**  that, you know, we were starved out, the commons weren't closed, our family had to leave, we  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:06):**  were exiles. And so, and then the exiles, my ancestors, not specifically my ancestors  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:13):**  and so much, but a lot of European ancestry did atrocious things in Australia and Canada  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:18):**  and the United States, because we recreated the oppression that we'd experienced in our  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:23):**  home country. So I think what this means is a full circle achievement to say, we're going  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:29):**  to now include everyone we were that was dispossessed on the continent that we colonized. And we  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:34):**  tried to we just almost destroyed and in some cases did destroy it so much. Now it's time  
**[0:23:39-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:39):**  to repair. Now it's time to apologize. Now it's time, I mean, it has been forever, but  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:47):**  it should have never happened in the way it did. But we can really just try now our best  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:52):**  to be humble and thoughtful. The thing I keep hearing about or that we would see is like,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:58):**  oh, it's, there's a lot of, you know, lack of understanding of how would our future looks  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:03):**  like because of all these extreme climactic changes. But what I keep seeing is every time  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:08):**  something catastrophic happens, like in my community, like a big fire, it's the sheep  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:14):**  grazers who come out the next year and start a matchmaking process between themselves and  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:20):**  landowners to get all the fire fuel load out of their communities. And I watched, I've  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:26):**  driven, I'm going to drive there tonight, an entire mountain that was covered in conservation  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:34):**  ethos, which is don't touch it. And this mountain now, the community was so scared it was going  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:40):**  to burn. And so I've driven out there and grazers that I work with have been working  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:46):**  on this landscape now for two years. All of the understory is healthy and low, but the  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:53):**  tree branches don't start until maybe like eight or 10 feet up. So fire can come through  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:58):**  and smolder, but it can't get into the catastrophic element of the tree canopy. And it was just  
**[0:25:03-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:03):**  to me to see the resilience of fiber systems. It's like, I love it. I love that we're ameliorating  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:12):**  catastrophic fire with fiber producing animals. So that's something I haven't, yeah, we're  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:19):**  going to talk about it more, but people who are like, a fire burned my house. I rebuilt  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:25):**  my house. I'm still having to evacuate, but my house isn't burning anymore because I have  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:31):**  been working with this forest proactively now for two years. Like people are staying  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:37):**  and they're trying to figure this out and the fiber systems are hugely integral to how  
**[0:25:41-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:41):**  they're staying. So anyway, just a little anecdote of positivity.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:56):**  This episode of Farmer Armour was made by me, Joe Barrett, Abby Rose and Olivia Oldham.

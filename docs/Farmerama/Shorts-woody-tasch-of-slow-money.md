**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:00):**  This is not about numbers doing these numbers versus doing those numbers.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:05):**  This is about reaffirming the primacy of words over the claims on our attention made by numbers.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:12):**  Reaffirming the primacy of relationships over the claims of transactions.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:18):**  Reaffirming the primacy of nutrition over the claims of cheap calories.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:24):**  Reaffirming the primacy of places over the claims of markets.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:30):**  Reaffirming the primacy of generations and seasons over the claims of milliseconds and algorithms.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:37):**  Reaffirming the primacy of putting back in over the claims of taking out.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:44):**  I'm Woody Tash, author of a few books about slow money and nurture capital and chairman of the Slow Money Institute.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:00:54):**  That is an excerpt from my new book, Soil, Notes Towards the Theory and Practice of Nurture Capital.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:03):**  It's kind of a sequel to Inquiries into the Nature of Slow Money, Investing as a Food Farm's Infertility Matter, my first book.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:11):**  After ten years of running around mostly the U.S. but a few other countries speaking to lots of people in groups large and small about  
**[0:01:21-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:21):**  the possibility of really developing and sharing a whole new vision of how we use our money locally,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:31):**  but even more local than that, the soil, all the way down to the land itself and the soil and how we would value that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:38):**  and hold that value against the claims of markets and all kinds of other fiduciary things.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:46):**  After ten years of having those conversations, I finally was able to pull back and write the second book.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:52):**  It both goes deeper into the concept of the soil itself.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:01:57):**  There's also a little play in words on there about slow opportunities for investing locally that spells soil.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:02):**  That's a new group that we started in Boulder that's making 0% loans to local farmers.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:08):**  What is slow money?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:10):**  Slow money is a shared vision of the importance of, and I'll say several things nested together, thinking very long term, being patient.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:24):**  The patience leads to the idea of slow, thinking more about preserving and restoring soil fertility than about extracting financial returns.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:36):**  But all of those things, the conversation about all those things is something that's turned into the slow money movement.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:43):**  It's basically a public conversation.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:45):**  Then from that conversation, a network of networks, if you will, a bunch of small local groups have sprouted up mostly in the U.S.,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:52):**  a few in Canada, a little bit in France, a tiny bit now in Australia,  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:02:57):**  where groups of people who have been participating in this conversation, you could call it sharing a vision,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:04):**  you could call it participating in an active conversation, trying to help one another move in a radical new direction.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:10):**  Those conversations and that network has led to the flow of $70 million into almost 700 small food enterprises,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:17):**  everything from individual organic farms to food processing, distribution, restaurants, slaughterhouses, cheese makers, seed companies,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:27):**  anything that is helping get local organic produce from the producer into the local market.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:33):**  So it's very local, small dots, groups of people collaborating together actively to help one another do that.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:40):**  From a financial standpoint, a little bit you could say that slow money is staking out territory between investing and philanthropy.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:46):**  So the first 0% loan that our new group in Boulder gave was to a farm and restaurant in Boulder,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:03:55):**  where the farm family has dedicated themselves to growing as much as possible that they serve in the restaurant from their own farm.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:02):**  And they were farming 200 acres, and they just leased another 200 acres, and they had no walk-in cooler on the second farm.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:09):**  They only had the cooler in their restaurant, and so we lent them $12,000 so they could have a walk-in cooler on the second farm.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:16):**  So very, you know, fairly straightforward, I guess you'd say.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:20):**  We made a second 0% loan to a biodynamic farm in Boulder called Aspen Moon that is renovating an old kind of ramshackle house  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:31):**  on one of their farm properties to create housing for their workers, and so we lent them $30,000 to assist them in some of the renovation.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:39):**  There are lots of other examples that are on slowmoney.org.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:43):**  I mean, there are hundreds of things like lending $5,000 for a hoop house or a few thousand dollars for drip irrigation line, things like that,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:51):**  you know, gradually moving up to like buying a used tractor or a refrigerated truck or things like that.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:04:57):**  And then they move up the kind of financial food chain up to small angel investments.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:02):**  There'll be hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then there are a few multimillion-dollar investments, only a few.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:06):**  So it's the whole gamut, everything from very small kind of microloans up to things that might be called a little bit more like angel investments.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:15):**  So this story arose one night in a conversation in Boulder where I live,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:23):**  where I had suggested the idea of what if we donated money and made 0% loans?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:29):**  And we started getting into a discussion about financial return and impact and success.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:35):**  How do we measure success?  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:37):**  So I found myself saying to the group, if you live next to or asking the group,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:43):**  I said if you live next to a farm and the barn burns down and you're in a position to loan the family money to rebuild the barn,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:51):**  how much interest are you going to charge?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:05:54):**  Now, this is kind of a self-selection thing that goes on in the slow money room, so just keep that in the back of your mind.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:01):**  But of course everyone goes, well, I wouldn't charge anything.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:04):**  I said, well, why wouldn't you?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:06):**  Because the return is not the money.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:08):**  The return is that the farm is still there, the barn gets rebuilt.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:12):**  I mean, it could be any number of reasons.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:14):**  It could be aesthetic, like we love the barn.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:16):**  It could be that you're buying milk from the cows that are milked in the barn.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:19):**  Who knows what it is?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:20):**  But you want the barn back there and you want the farm family made whole and you're willing to lend them the money.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:25):**  And that's because those so-called impacts, all those other social and environmental returns that impact investors who are more institutional or institutional, say they have to measure,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:36):**  you don't need anybody to measure them for you.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:39):**  So it isn't really a zero.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:40):**  It's 0% by arithmetic, but it's not 0% by everything else.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:44):**  It's like a humongous return, right?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:47):**  But as soon as you and a bunch of your friends are investing in, let's say, 10 barns on 10 different farms scattered throughout a couple of counties or something,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:06:57):**  then suddenly you have a portfolio and it's like, well, who decides which barns and which one is riskier than the other one and which one is more important and how do we do that?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:05):**  Suddenly the arithmetic isn't enough anymore.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:08):**  So it gets more complicated.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:09):**  So if you do 10 of them and you lose one or two but you help eight, and this, by the way, was the remainder of that same conversation.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:19):**  I'm not making this up.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:20):**  There's about 15 of us in the room.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:22):**  So I said, okay, were we successful or did we fail?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:25):**  Everyone said, you're totally successful.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:26):**  You helped eight farms.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:28):**  I said, yeah, most people would call that philanthropy because we have a negative return.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:31):**  We lost some of our money.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:34):**  But what was the impact in the community?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:35):**  Who's going to measure that?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:36):**  Well, the answer is we didn't need anybody to measure it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:39):**  We're just affirming we were successful.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:41):**  So there is a better way of saying all that from a traditional finance, and that would be to say that it's plus 80% philanthropy as opposed to minus 20% investing.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:51):**  But I don't like using that language because that's the old language.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:54):**  I just say it's slow money.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:55):**  It's nurture capital.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:07:56):**  We don't want to do that old arithmetic anymore.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:00):**  I sometimes jokingly refer to it as the investing arithmetic of the 20th century.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:04):**  But it doesn't just go away, obviously, but it's more we know why we're doing it.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:09):**  We want there to be more small and midsize organic farms in our community.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:13):**  We are willing to invest in that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:16):**  Investing to me means leaving money in, not about how fast you can take it out.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:20):**  And modern investing has been all about how fast you can take it out.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:23):**  So there's so many different elements to the question of what your return is.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:27):**  Zero percent is one form of arithmetic, minus 20% is another form of arithmetic, plus 80% is another form of arithmetic.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:36):**  And actually, none of the arithmetic actually matters that much because the passage you had me read was it's not about doing the numbers.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:43):**  It's about reaffirming the primacy of relationships over the claims of transactions.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:47):**  If you'll indulge me, I'm going to tell you another story because I've sort of collected stories because if you're going to say it's not all about the numbers,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:55):**  then it's got to be about something, so it ends up being about stories.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:08:59):**  So I was giving a keynote speech at the 20th anniversary of the Minnesota Sustainable Farmers Association about, I don't know, five or six years ago.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:11):**  And I gave a long talk.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:14):**  We had lunch and then we all reconvened, about 300 people, most of them farmers in the room and the families.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:19):**  And we started having a group discussion and one of the farmers said,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:23):**  I'm listening with interest, it's really interesting, but I'm thinking how would I do it?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:29):**  And you're saying I would have to take a loan from some of my neighbors.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:32):**  He said, I don't even like most of my neighbors.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:35):**  And everybody laughed.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:37):**  And I was just learning as I went.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:40):**  I mean, we were just having a genuine conversation.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:42):**  I said, well, you know, you're right because transactions are hard enough, but relationships are even harder.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:48):**  So if you're going to add relationships to transactions, oh my God, what a headache.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:52):**  It's going to be hard.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:09:54):**  And then I had what I sometimes euphemistically call my aha moments,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:00):**  these things I've learned along the way from talking to everybody.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:02):**  And I said, wait a minute, how many people here are farming because it's easy?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:06):**  And then a really hard laugh went through, much bigger than the first one.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:09):**  I said, right, you're farming for all kinds of reasons.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:12):**  You're stuck.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:13):**  It's a vocation.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:14):**  It's a passion.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:15):**  There's a million reasons you're doing it, but not one of them is because it's easy.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:19):**  I said, who told you that investing was supposed to be easy?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:22):**  So we have the world of easy investing.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:24):**  It's called shopping malls and smokestacks in China and sweatshops and GMO corn and high fructose corn.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:33):**  You just add all the things in there you want, that industrialization and globalization has been supported  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:42):**  by so-called easy investing, meaning investing that you give to somebody else.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:46):**  You say, you do it for me.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:48):**  Just give me back 5% return so I can retire or whatever that is.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:53):**  Well, that's pretty easy for you because you just give it to them.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:56):**  You don't really know what they're doing.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:10:58):**  So if we are going to accept responsibility for the relationships,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:07):**  then the investing will not be, let's say, as easy, but it will be more rewarding.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:11):**  If you give the money to someone and they don't repay, what happens?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:16):**  In my experience, nothing bad happens, meaning everyone in the room has understood why they're doing it.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:23):**  Nobody is looking to foreclose on the thing.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:27):**  I mean, sometimes we have collateral, sometimes we don't because no one, even though we might have it,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:33):**  it's more there as a kind of a placeholder for the idea that we'd like to try to get our money back if possible,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:40):**  not because we want to go take possession of the walk-in cooler or whatever it is.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:44):**  So no, there's no shaming.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:49):**  I think everyone in the room has already accepted the idea of sharing risk.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:55):**  And so they're not, it's like we're all in it together.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:11:59):**  Everybody is invested in the long-term success of the collective venture,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:04):**  which is supporting the next generation of organic farms in our community.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:08):**  So that's the long-term thing.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:10):**  And so our eye is definitely on that, and we know we're going to have failures along the way.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:14):**  You can do everything right and get hailed out.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:16):**  You can make a lot of stupid business decisions.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:19):**  You can bet your whole business on selling to one large retailer who shall remain unnamed and get screwed.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:30):**  So someone looking back on it can go, that was stupid, but you know, wasn't stupid? Who knows?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:35):**  Most small businesses fail. This is the other thing.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:38):**  Shaming is risky for all kinds of reasons above and beyond just normal business risk,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:42):**  because a lot of times it doesn't rain or whatever.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:45):**  But that doesn't mean it's inherently more risky than any small startup at a local business.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:50):**  Small businesses fail at a fairly high rate. It's hard.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:53):**  Being an entrepreneur is really hard.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:54):**  Being a farmer is a very unusual kind of entrepreneur.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:12:57):**  So that's a long way of saying there's no shame in failure,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:01):**  and there really is an ethos of shared risk in the room that seems to get us through all these.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:07):**  Now, I can't speak to all 698 or whatever the number of transactions that have happened everywhere.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:13):**  There have certainly been some pissed off people here and there on both sides,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:17):**  but by and large I can say for sure that it's a very small minority of the situations.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:24):**  You know, anybody who has any money in a bank or a mutual fund,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:28):**  any kind of institutional, securitized financial instrument, doesn't know where all their money is.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:36):**  Now, there are impact investing funds that are doing their best to screen out certain things,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:45):**  like they won't invest in oil stocks or they won't invest in nuclear or tobacco  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:51):**  or companies that have more than a certain percentage of money from arms manufacture.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:13:56):**  I mean, there's a whole bunch of different what are called in the investment industry negative screens,  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:00):**  things you don't want in there.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:03):**  And then there are positive screens, which are things like women on the board of directors  
**[0:14:09-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:09):**  or working in disadvantaged communities, having either manufacturing or sales in communities that are disadvantaged.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:19):**  So there's a bunch of social and environmental screens that impact investors use.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:24):**  But it is still the case, almost without any doubt, like I'll give one example.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:31):**  Almost every socially responsible fund still owns Coca-Cola.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:36):**  And you say, how can that be?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:38):**  They're selling soda water to, you know, poor people all over the world  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:44):**  and getting them hooked on sugar water and making them unhealthy.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:48):**  Because there are certain parameters that Coca-Cola meets that allows enough of the managers to check it off.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:54):**  And guess what? They're making a lot of money, so they want it in the portfolio  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:14:58):**  because they might be invested in a hundred companies, let's say, in the portfolio,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:02):**  and they need something from the fast food sector and something from the oil patch.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:06):**  So it's kind of a crazy game. And the reason is they're starting with the numbers.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:11):**  They're saying, we have to make 5%, we have to make 7%, we have to make the industry benchmark.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:17):**  As soon as you do that, you are forced to put things in that portfolio that are either very weak  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:23):**  or somewhat compromised or actually greenwashed in some cases.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:26):**  But I'm not accusing anybody of greenwashed. I'm just saying, you know, if I signed up for that job,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:31):**  I would have to do the same thing. If I'm promising I'm going to make 7%,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:35):**  I'm sure I'm not going to make it investing in local organic farms, that is for sure.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:39):**  So if you just use that as the whole other end of the continuum.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:43):**  So the first part of this is for people to just admit that's true.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:48):**  They don't know where all their money is.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:50):**  No matter how beautiful the people they hire to manage their money is or the fund that they choose,  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:15:54):**  it is going to have some money in sweatshops and smokestacks in China and GMOs and junk food  
**[0:16:02-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:02):**  and maybe even tobacco because the portfolios are so diversified and so big that they almost by definition  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:10):**  end up in there even if it's by accident. It could be just a division of a company.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:14):**  It could be a very large company. You know, a $10 billion company has a $100 million division,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:19):**  but the rest of it seems okay. So that's just the way it is.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:22):**  So you have to recognize it's like, wow, I'm not really in control of my money,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:26):**  neither is my money manager really. So then once you realize that,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:30):**  then you have to decide how much you care. And that's not said facetiously because you just have to decide  
**[0:16:38-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:38):**  how much do you care about that. And then you have to say, do I care enough to take some of my money  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:47):**  consciously out of that easy investing world where I'm just giving it to somebody else  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:51):**  and hoping they won't do anything too horrible with it versus I want to take the money  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:16:56):**  and put it to work directly in my community doing something really positive.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:00):**  And I would argue the most positive thing you can do is make a loan to a farmer.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:04):**  It's the most tangible. It's never going to be public company. It's never going to move away.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:09):**  The land is there. The farmer may move away, but the land isn't going anywhere.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:13):**  It's very place-based, very tangible, and the rewards are immediate in terms of you can see food growing there  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:19):**  and you can understand that fertility is being grown, if you want to use that word, in the soil and preserve the soil.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:26):**  So you have to decide, let's say, how much that means to you, how much of your time you're willing to spend on it  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:32):**  because it takes more time. It's not as easy as the other.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:36):**  As far as the actual, let's say, if the question is like, how would someone start doing slow money investing on their own,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:43):**  I would say, you know, it's kind of hard by yourself because going through that whole thought process  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:48):**  by yourself takes a lot of gumption. It's a lot better, you know, misery loves company,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:53):**  or shared learning is beautiful, or shared risk is beautiful.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:17:57):**  So you want to do it with some friends where you can do it over a period of time and share learning  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:01):**  and kind of be comfortable and be confident that you're building something for the future.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:05):**  So I actually just gave a long argument for why the soil experiment we're doing with the 0% loans  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:10):**  and the philanthropy for the donations, as she said, is a good model because I think building something together  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:16):**  with a bunch of your friends and neighbors for the long-term benefit of the community  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:21):**  is so much more satisfying than doing it by yourself. That's why I gradually came up with that model.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:28):**  It was just after watching, doing a lot, and watching a lot of slow money investing.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:32):**  You know, I mean, yes, it is wildly satisfied. I'll just get another story.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:36):**  I drove down the street about three years ago with two checks for $5,000, one from me and one from a neighbor,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:44):**  to lend to a farmer to put drip irrigation in a new couple acres. I don't remember how many acres it was.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:51):**  And he needed the money for 90 days. It was the beginning of the season.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:55):**  And he paid us back nine days later, 0%. I didn't know that at the time.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:18:59):**  I was just driving down the street, and I had this big grin on my face the whole way down,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:04):**  the whole way while I was giving him the money. That grin was actually bigger than when he gave—  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:08):**  I'm not making this up. That was actually bigger than when he gave it back,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:11):**  but I was really happy when he gave it back. I said, oh, look, it worked. It's great.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:15):**  But it's still hard as an individual. It's hard to maintain that energy, right?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:21):**  You have to spend a lot of time, energy, whatever.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:23):**  So that's why slow money has emerged in collections, I should say, of people.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:29):**  So most of the groups have a few dozen regular stalwarts who get together, let's say, at least every other month,  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:36):**  sometimes once a month. And they get to know each other, and they get to know what's going on.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:40):**  There's like cohesion, so-called social capital. Some of those people use that term.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:45):**  That's a little stilted, I think. But it's friendships, shared risk.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:50):**  Anybody can do it. So I'm sort of speaking out of both sides of my mouth. Anybody can do it.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:19:54):**  It's not rocket science. It just takes some clarity of vision and some stick-to-it-iveness  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:00):**  to realize it's going to take you some time to do it. It definitely takes more time.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:05):**  And a very smart person in a recent public conversation talked about investing yourself versus investing money.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:13):**  And that's a big part of it. It's what does it mean to invest?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:17):**  If investing means just giving your money to some stranger so they can grow the money arithmetically,  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:22):**  that's one kind of investing. If investing means taking time and energy and committing yourself to something  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:27):**  because it's a cause you believe in, that's a different kind of investing.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:31):**  I don't think it's too much to say that a small organic farmer in today's world,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:36):**  going against all the headwinds of globalization and industrialization and consumerism and commodification  
**[0:20:42-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:42):**  and buy low, sell high and all those things, they are just going, I don't know if we want to say 180 degrees against it,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:51):**  certainly at a 90 degree angle, but maybe 180 degrees against it, saying, no, we're doing this.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:20:59):**  We know this is important. And I think reconnecting people to one another and the places where they live,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:05):**  through their food and through the soil.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:08):**  My new book does start with a 20-page, what I call quasi-mythic poem, and the word hero and myth and whatever is saying.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:17):**  Because I do think there's a kind of almost a mythic, I know it sounds really hokey,  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:21):**  but there's almost a level of questioning some of the most fundamental assumptions we have about our species  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:27):**  and religion and economics and all that stuff. It does almost rise to the level of myth.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:32):**  So I started my new book with a very provocative and playful 20-page, what I refer to as quasi-mythic poem.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:40):**  But there's one real person in there, and the real person is Masanobu Fukuoka.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:48):**  I always get the name a little wrong.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:50):**  Who was a real person, he's no longer alive.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:53):**  He's kind of a pioneer of what you say deep organic permaculture vision of agriculture,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:21:59):**  of farming as wildly and as naturally as possible.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:03):**  And in his book, The One Straw Revolution, which is kind of a little bit of a manifesto for an early wave of organic farmers,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:10):**  he wrote the following sentence, which I have him saying in the mythic poem to a bunch of gods and goddesses.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:17):**  I hope what I just said is intriguing and people will want to figure out what that all is.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:22):**  But what he says is so beautiful.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:24):**  He says, the true purpose of farming is not the growing of food, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:33):**  Now that's pretty heroic.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:36):**  Now really, small farmers don't need to hear any encouragement from me, I don't think.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:43):**  The only thing that could be encouraging is that there's a small but growing group of people who highly value what...  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:49):**  That's not even true.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:50):**  The number of people who value what they're doing is pretty large.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:53):**  Translating that into financial action, there's a big gap there.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:22:58):**  And so the consumer part is obvious.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:00):**  That's Slow Food and a whole bunch of other people who are mobilizing consumers to intentionally drive their consumer dollars.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:06):**  So we're kind of coming up fast, coming up slowly with the investor part, saying we've got to bring our investor dollars there,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:15):**  which I do think in a certain way is, I'm not going to say is more fundamental, but it's as fundamentally important.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:22):**  Because if we buy all of our food from a CSA or a farmer's market, but our money is invested in the industrial system,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:29):**  we're kind of, you know, which, are we healing more or are we doing more harm? Hard to know.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:34):**  We're certainly compromising deeply that which we're trying to do.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:37):**  So if this is encouraging, I'd like small farmers here, we are.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:42):**  I'm quite sure from my experience in Slow Money to date, which came after 35 years of lots of other stuff in finance of different kinds,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:50):**  meaning I may be crazy, but I'm not young and crazy.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:54):**  So I've been at it for a while.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:23:56):**  I am convinced there are many millions of people, how many? It's hard to say,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:00):**  but many millions of people who really want something like this to happen.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:04):**  They want to reconnect. They want to bring their money back down to earth.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:08):**  They want to fully value things in the earth and in their community.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:13):**  And it's hard at the beginning. I mean, we're just at the beginning. It's hard.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:16):**  But I think this is a generational shift. So we all just have to keep at it.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-woody-tasch-of-slow-money#t=0:24:46):**  Thank you.

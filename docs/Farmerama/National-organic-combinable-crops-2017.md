### Farmerama  (Sun, 23 Jul 2017 15:32:30)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:00):**  On July 6th we headed to Fullerton Farms partnership near Andover with a couple of  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:11):**  hundred farmers for the 10th National Organic Combineable Crops event.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:17):**  Famed for its delicious lunches and plentiful tea breaks, the day was alive with farmers,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:22):**  traders, researchers, millers, processors and bakers exchanging ideas of how to work  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:27):**  together to support ecological farming methods and grow and make healthy food.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:32):**  This is a special episode commissioned by Organic Farmers and Growers who organised NOCC.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:37):**  They're one of the UK's largest organic certification bodies.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:41):**  Their commitment to be open, innovative and support a better farming future for all echoed  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:47):**  throughout every corner of the barn. Here's organiser Stephen Jacobs.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:51):**  NOCC, what's it all about? National Organic Combineable Crops or NOCC is the event we  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:00:58):**  hold each year to bring the community together to share knowledge. It's based around combinable  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:04):**  crops, that's cereals and pulses, looking at the challenges of growing them organically but also  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:09):**  the markets available. We have everybody come together for breakfast in the morning and straight  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:14):**  into the talks and panel discussions and the farm walk where we take people around different  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:21):**  parts of the site looking at crop varieties. We've got agroforestry represented this year.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:26):**  We also have a detailed look at soil analysis. Then we all get back together for an organic  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:34):**  lunch and then some more talks and panel discussions in the afternoon followed by tea  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:40):**  and cake. It's our annual get together, it's well attended and we're very pleased this year  
**[0:01:46-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:46):**  to be hosted by the Liddell family in Hampshire. And just so you know it was so hot. The sweltering  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:01:55):**  heat kept everyone sweaty but undeterred to gather every grain of knowledge they could.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:00):**  Tim May was one attendee and he shares with us his impression of the event.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:04):**  It's quite hot. I'm sort of in that stage at the moment as a newcomer into organic production,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:13):**  organic cereals, is to try and understand what the market wants. I always actually like  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:17):**  coming to mix with the organic farmers. They always seem a bit more market orientated.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:21):**  They're a bit more willing to take control of their own destiny than the conventional  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:25):**  farmers. So there's normally a bit more of a buzz about their products and a bit more  
**[0:02:29-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:29):**  pride in what they're doing. So it's a very sort of upbeat sort of deal.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:38):**  We start with what to grow. In the morning panel discussion there was a call for more  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:43):**  farmers to trial new and different varieties on farm. The message was clear. Citizen science  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:50):**  and on farm research are vital in order for the organic arable sector to continue to develop  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:02:56):**  and produce high quality nutritious grains. Researcher Ed Dickin tells us about some breeding  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:02):**  trials he's been doing on his parents farm. It's taken him 10 years to get this far, but  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:09):**  as one organic grower pointed out, it could happen much quicker if more farmers were involved  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:13):**  in the development of crop trials. I'm Ed Dickin. I'm a lecturer at Harper Adams,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:21):**  but my research interest, which is a bit of a hobby, is breeding cereals, looking at nutrition  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:27):**  and human health as well as for yield. So the main one I do is naked barley, which is  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:33):**  barley specifically for human food. It threshes freely, bit of a tongue twister, free threshing  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:40):**  from the husk. So you can use it, human food, without further processing. So you don't have  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:46):**  to pearl it. So pearling is what's done to normal covered barley, which is the abrasion  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:52):**  of the hull, but that also removes the germ or the embryo and not the bran, which is what  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:03:57):**  a lot of the good stuff is. So naked barley can be used as whole grain without that need  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:02):**  for pearling. And then what you do with it, you can flake it, you can mill it for flour,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:07):**  you can use it as a whole grain in things like risotto as a substitute for rice and  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:13):**  anything else you can think of. Stephen Jacob, the organic farmers and growers, he came to  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:19):**  one of the events we did with the Welsh Grain Forum, who got interested when I was working  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:25):**  at Bangor University on naked barley. So the Parrys who've got a watermill at Bellinganon  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:32):**  near Aberystwyth, they were looking at milling some of the naked barley. So that sort of  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:37):**  got an introduction through them. Then growing hen gumrow, which is an old Welsh wheat variety.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:45):**  So this is where other interests started coming in. That's when I got the contact with Andy  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:51):**  Forbes at Bothwell Bake and started also experimenting with some of the old wheats as well. So now  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:04:56):**  expanded into wheats, rivet wheat as well, looking a bit at emmer and all sorts of other  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:02):**  grains as well as naked barley. At the moment the markets are small. We're dealing with  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:07):**  two companies at the moment, Hodmer Dodds, who many of the people would have heard of  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:12):**  with the pulses, but they're also interested in grains. Their first product is a naked  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:19):**  barley flake, which can be used in breakfast cereals, it can be added to bread and you  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:24):**  can make really good porridge out of it, especially if you mix it with oats, because the oats  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:27):**  give a bit of a creaminess and then the barley flakes give a bit more flavour, a bit of bite.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:33):**  And also Ed Me, who provides ingredients for bread making and they've been looking at  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:39):**  it for their whole soft process where they sort of hydrate and cook the grains and supply  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:45):**  them pasteurised in vacuum packed bags and then bakers can add those grains straight  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:51):**  into their dough and because those grains are already hydrated they're not going to  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:05:55):**  suck moisture out of the dough so you don't have to adjust your water and flour volume.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:00):**  So they're ready to use. So those are the two companies at the moment. We're also talking  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:05):**  to various other people and so there is interest at the moment on a fairly small scale. Today  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:11):**  has been really, it's great to talk to interested people and interesting people with sort of  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:18):**  similar ideas. I'm not an organic farmer, I'm a conventional farmer, but finding have  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:23):**  a lot in common and this whole idea of trying to develop shorter supply chains and getting  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:29):**  good relationships with perhaps smaller processes, people like Bodma Dobson, I think that's the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:34):**  way to go and bring these different crops forward because really growing commodity crops  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:39):**  at the moment, either conventional or maybe even organically, it is very difficult. We're  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:46):**  competing with maize production in estates for example for animal feed and we just can't  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:53):**  do it.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:06:55):**  In the morning panel, scientist and innovator Martin Wolf talked about the ORC Wakelands  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:00):**  population that he has been breeding for many years. He told us that the breeding of this  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:06):**  population is based on a simple principle at the core of Charles Darwin's theory of  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:10):**  evolution that we must have diversity in our breeding populations to ensure a resilient  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:15):**  future for that crop. The population was bred by making 190 crosses among 20 different parent  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:22):**  varieties and mixing all the resulting seed. This goes against the current thinking where  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:28):**  breeding aims to produce a crop that is genetically identical.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:34):**  Of course this radically different approach raised many questions but there was one wonderful  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:39):**  moment on the day where the whole supply chain connected up and we saw a hint of what's possible.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:45):**  Earlier this year, Josiah Meldrum of Hodgme Dobs brought some Wakelands population flower  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:49):**  to Kimberley Bell at the small food bakery in Nottingham. Here's what happened.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:07:54):**  One of the most important things that I've learnt from trying to bake for this week is  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:00):**  that you actually have to adjust your perception as a maker and try and apply everything you  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:04):**  know but to try and get the best product that you can out of the wheat. When I found out  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:09):**  about the Wakelands population it just seemed like an inherently good idea to me and I felt  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:13):**  like it's my role as a baker to try and make that work as a product. It's not for me to  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:18):**  turn around and say it's not high enough in protein.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:20):**  I've only been baking with it for a little while. It's a sourdough made with 100% whole  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:25):**  grain and the thing I've been concentrating on is the flavour. It occurred to me that  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:30):**  with such a biodiversity and natural crop doing some interesting things with fermentation  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:35):**  might yield a depth of flavour that you might not be able to get from a single variety.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:39):**  So that's what I've been working on.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:41):**  We need to understand the two different positions, you know, what the baker requires, what the  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:45):**  farmer needs to get in terms of yield and reliability and if we can bring them together  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:50):**  and make a connection which Hovmador has done then we can make something that the farmer  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:55):**  might be very sceptical about, the baker might be very nervous about actually work and create  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:08:59):**  something delicious that people are clearly enjoying. So that's what we're all about.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:03):**  It's so exciting. It feels like really exciting to be right here right now surrounded by grain  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:09):**  and wheat and eating bread.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:11):**  Absolutely and we're part of a global revolution. That's the exciting thing. This is happening  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:15):**  all over the world. It's happening in the States, it's happening across Europe. We're  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:18):**  in touch with organisations like Hovmador, like Kimberley and the Small Food Bakery,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:22):**  like Martin at Wake and Zagro Forestry who are rethinking how we make bread, how we eat  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:28):**  bread, where the cereal comes from, what we can do to create a more resilient, long term,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:33):**  sustainable food system that produces nutritious, not just bread that fills you up but bread  
**[0:09:37-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:37):**  that sustains you through the day. That's what it's all about.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:50):**  The bread was incredibly delicious, a totally unique flavour. The panel I hosted after lunch  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:09:56):**  had a mixture of non-organic and organic farmers sharing what they are experimenting with on  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:00):**  their farms. It became clear that all are aligned on principles of diversity, increasing  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:06):**  soil organic matter and building a resilient business.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:11):**  One of the panellists, John Pawsey, is a farmer who has invested in a piece of machinery from  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:15):**  Sweden that's helping build resilience in his business and has allowed him to experiment  
**[0:10:20-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:20):**  with relay cropping, directly planting a second crop into the current crop before harvest.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:31):**  My name's John Pawsey, I farm about 650 hectares in Suffolk. We also farm about 930 hectares  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:40):**  for other farmers, it's all farmed organically. I also have 670 breeding ewes, we're increasing  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:46):**  that year on year, really to sort of close the nutrient gap on the farm, to extend our  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:51):**  rotation to include more lays and to ultimately build fertility so we build a long term, sustainable  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:58):**  rotation.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:10:59):**  So we've done two years of relay cropping and they're both using the same crops which  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:04):**  is using spring oats with buckwheat. So the idea with relay cropping is you harvest the  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:09):**  crop of oats and then afterwards you harvest the crop of buckwheat. So how do you do that?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:14):**  So first of all you drill your spring oats and they come up and then with our drill we  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:18):**  can drill a row of buckwheat in between the two rows of spring barley at a later date  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:22):**  so it comes to harvest later. And the idea is to try and get two crops out of the field  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:27):**  which sounds a little bit greedy but actually the upshot really is that you could get a  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:32):**  crop of it but also if you don't get a crop of it it could also be something you could  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:36):**  crimp a roll or roll down to a surface of mulch to suppress weeds or you could just  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:40):**  incorporate it into your soil and it would be a green manure. So it's just trying to  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:44):**  bring sort of more diversity into what we're trying to do to produce potentially different  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:50):**  results to either produce more output from the field or to increase soil organic matter  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:54):**  or suppress weeds.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:11:56):**  I thought that relay cropping would be a good idea because actually it does have different  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:00):**  outcomes. I think what you're trying to do as a farmer is you're trying to spread the  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:04):**  risk of anything failing and the way you spread the risk of anything failing is to bring as  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:10):**  much diversity into the field as possible. Now I know that you know just having oats  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:16):**  and buckwheat isn't a huge amount of diversity but when you start thinking along the lines  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:21):**  of you know other crops you could be growing in conjunction and there might be three crops  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:24):**  you could grow or you might be able to harvest crops together. I think you know it's about  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:29):**  taking the risk out of anything going wrong and be it weeds overtaking your crop and the  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:34):**  way you suppress them is by putting in another crop in the bottom of the crop that you're  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:38):**  initially wanting to harvest, being the second crop then suppressing the weeds or you know  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:43):**  building fertility by incorporating the relay crop into the ground if you can't harvest  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:47):**  it.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:48):**  The first thing you have to know is what outcome do you want. First of all it's your desired  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:53):**  outcome because then that will enable you to make the right selection. So the desired  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:12:59):**  outcome for us with the buckwheat was to possibly take a crop off it but also the roots of the  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:05):**  buckwheat exude a chemical that makes locked up phosphate become available and the next  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:10):**  crop we were going to plant was going to be beans which needs phosphate at the early seedling  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:14):**  stage. So that was what we really wanted out of it and the bonus would be that if we could  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:20):**  take a crop off each.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:21):**  Another thing that was a first I think is we had a sort of agroforestry demonstration  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:26):**  and I've been going to Martin Woolf's farm in Wakelands in East Suffolk, it's very close  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:31):**  to my farm, for a long time looking at his agroforestry system and every time I see it  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:35):**  I get incredibly excited about it. I haven't done it at home yet but I plan to do some  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:40):**  and it was really good to see it demonstrated here at NOC and it's also very exciting the  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:44):**  more people, not just organic but conventional farmers are beginning to talk about it. Watch  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:48):**  this space.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:49):**  Next, farmer Sophie Alexander told us about her involvement in compost tea trials, her  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:54):**  on-farm research that is part of an innovative farmers project.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:13:58):**  My name's Sophie Alexander, I farm in Dorset at Hemsworth Farm, it's about 400 hectares,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:06):**  it's now entirely organic and we have a lot of cattle which are brought to the farm by  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:14):**  a dairy farmer, an organic dairy farmer so we look after his replacements. Otherwise  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:19):**  we grow mostly wheat, barley and oats and quite often we grow beans.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:24):**  I've only been managing the farm, this is our sixth year and when I took it on I knew  
**[0:14:31-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:31):**  it was quite a tired, well used farm, knackered farm. First of all doing the overwinter cover  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:40):**  crops, really long legume lays and getting the cattle on, that was the most instant way  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:47):**  of being able to rejuvenate the farm. But looking for other ways to supplement that,  
**[0:14:54-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:14:54):**  I couldn't make enough farmyard manure and compost to apply and I read quite a lot about  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:03):**  compost teas and then just happened to bump into a few people who were very encouraging  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:09):**  about compost teas. I thought well, you know, let's give it a go, it's got a wonderful  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:15):**  logic about it in that it's going to boost the microbiology of the soil which is what  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:21):**  makes plants grow, it releases nitrogen, it suppresses diseases.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:28):**  So far the first year what has been demonstrated is that there is a significant increase in  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:36):**  the fungal and microbiological activity in the soil that's been treated. This year it's  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:44):**  tailed off because the last couple of applications we did the moisture content of the soil was  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:49):**  really low and I think it was probably just applying microbes that couldn't survive sadly,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:15:56):**  so the graphs show good activity when the moisture is high but then not much, so I don't  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:03):**  know whether it'll help us much this year. So last year the trials were on an oat crop.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:12):**  What we found with the oats, and it was a surprising result because you know, until  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:17):**  I came to want to buy more oat seed, firth oat seed in the spring, for spring planting,  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:25):**  I tested my own grain to see what the disease profile was and what we had in store, what  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:31):**  we had treated with compost tea had an appreciably lower disease rating than what I could buy  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:38):**  on the open market. So I kept back some tonnage and cleaned it and had it tested again and  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:44):**  so that's a good result, you know, that saves money too. So difficulties I find driving  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:51):**  over the crop. I don't like doing that, I mean you know it's really good to have a very  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:16:57):**  wide sprayer, it's about 36 metres and really what happens is you know I've tried to make  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:03):**  the applications earlier and earlier because the first couple of times you go over it seems  
**[0:17:08-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:08):**  to recover and then third time sort of beginning of June, end of May, it stays there, it doesn't  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:18):**  look good and I worry about disease possibly getting into the stunted plants. So that's  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:26):**  a bit of an issue and then I'm also finding the amount of water we use is concerning me,  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:32):**  particularly in this very, very dry year. Because we use a contractors sprayer, so he's  
**[0:17:39-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:39):**  using it for conventional chemical applications a lot of the time and he's incredibly diligent  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:47):**  and conscientious, he wants to wash out from the sprayer every single trace of chemical,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:53):**  but he does use thousands of gallons of water and we are using thousands of gallons of water  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:17:58):**  in making the compost tea, you know we're making 8000 gallons. The other difficulty  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:04):**  I have at the moment is I've had this wonderful, very accommodating contractor with his magnificent  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:10):**  Amazon 36 metre sprayer, but he is upgrading. He is going to buy state of the art, very  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:18):**  precision, sort of almost robotic sprayer and I can just tell from the expression on  
**[0:18:24-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:24):**  his face he does not want my compost tea in it, which I have to sympathise with. So do  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:32):**  I have enough faith in the efficacious qualities of compost tea to buy his sprayer? It means  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:41):**  I would use less water because I wouldn't have to clean it out as thoroughly. I don't  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:45):**  know, I'll have to make the decision probably by Christmas. If you could find other farmers  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:50):**  to go in on it with, I mean is that a possibility? It could be a possibility. If another organic  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:18:56):**  farmer was prepared to do that they would have to be geographically very close. I think  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:03):**  it's great if farmers collaborate on machinery and things, I really do, but the reality is  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:10):**  most of us want it because we want it when we need it. Maybe a compost tea sprayer is  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:17):**  not as vital, you can move the application dates by a week or so. Maybe I'll brew for  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:24):**  other people and spray for other people, there's a thought. That's a third dimension I hadn't  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:28):**  thought of, Abbie. I love that, we're being very entrepreneurial on the spot. Yeah, there  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:34):**  you go. Finally we hear from Andy Howard, a non-organic  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:38):**  farmer who spent his Nuffield Scholarship learning about intercropping around the world.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:43):**  For him, low input is not only more ecological, it's also better economically. Using clever  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:49):**  strategies and well thought out practices can be at least if not more productive and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:54):**  results in a more viable farming business. I went to a meeting about five years ago where  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:19:59):**  a French farmer was talking about companion cropping with all seed rape and I thought,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:04):**  well it just made sense. I tried it on the farm and it seemed to work fine and that's  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:09):**  what got me interested in the whole companion cropping, intercropping subject which led  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:14):**  onto my Nuffield. At the time I didn't see it as a solution to any particular problem  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:19):**  we had on the farm at the time, but now I know more, I realise that intercropping has  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:23):**  the potential to mitigate a fair few modern agronomy problems. The first one we did was  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:29):**  winter all seed rape, companion cropped with vetch and buckwheat and that didn't seem to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:36):**  harm the crop, we used no herbicide, less fertiliser and we didn't see a yield loss.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:43):**  There's plenty of research now saying you can get yield benefits and better, less insecticide,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:48):**  less fungicide, as a conventional farmer. Now we're doing spring peas and spring all  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:20:54):**  seed rape together and the idea of that is the all seed rape stops the peas falling over  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:00):**  and come harvest we can harvest both and we're not scraping the peas off the floor. We're  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:05):**  also doing a little bit of beans and oats, the oats are helping weed control in the beans  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:12):**  and reducing disease and the last thing is chickpeas and linseed together and again the  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:19):**  linseed is a, helps weed control plus disease control in the chickpeas.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:24):**  I guess so far in our field scale P. Ola which is the peas and all seed rape and we haven't  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:29):**  needed fungicides, no fertiliser in that crop so I did a tissue test on the peas and the  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:35):**  rape in this field at the same time and rape being very nitrogen hungry you would expect  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:41):**  to be low in nitrogen but it showed to be high in nitrogen when it was mixed with the  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:45):**  peas so you can see that the two are working together for mutual benefit. I can see it  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:51):**  being a part of the solution of weed control for organic no-till but it's definitely a  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:21:57):**  challenge organic no-till and it wouldn't be the one solution but it definitely would  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:01):**  play a part.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:02):**  Just planting other crops with your main cash crop to help suppress weeds or out compete  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:09):**  weeds the idea is really that you're filling the niche that the weed would take so if you're  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:14):**  planting wheat maybe you should be planting other crops like oats, spring oats that might  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:19):**  die over winter, radish, vetch which will help suppress other weeds. There's one guy  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:24):**  in Saskatchewan people say to me intercropping you can't do on a large scale. Well he was  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:28):**  doing 5,000 acres and 2,500 acres was in intercropped every year and he was separating it all at  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:35):**  harvest so scale isn't really a barrier if you think about it and he'd been doing it  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:42):**  for 15 years and I guess someone like Gabe Brown in North Dakota he would never plant  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:49):**  a monoculture he had a livestock, he'd increased his soil organic matter to 8, 9%, never used  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:22:56):**  any fertiliser, he was conventional and just seeing someone like that go from a low base  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:02):**  to being almost without inputs that's really inspiring.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:06):**  There's lots of stuff going on, lots of farmers are interested, I've spoken at lots of meetings  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:11):**  and it seems to be in the press, farming press, there's two European projects starting looking  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:17):**  into intercropping, the Remix project and the Diversify project, there seems to be a  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:22):**  real interest in intercropping and for me the whole thing is exciting, growing two or  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:27):**  more plants in the field at the same time is much more interesting than a boring field  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:32):**  of wheat, it just makes life more exciting. I've been speaking to Millers today, I've  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:37):**  actually been and had chats with the end user and the processors and they seem as keen as  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:44):**  us to have variety mixtures which is the simplest form of intercropping which gives disease  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:50):**  benefit, they seem very open minded to doing that so for me that's quite exciting for intercropping  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:23:55):**  to take off we need to get the end user, the customer to understand the environmental benefits  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:01):**  and it does seem that they are looking for those stories and don't really see a problem  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:05):**  of having variety mixtures coming through their mills or their molesters.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:11):**  Great that Andy reiterates the importance of the whole system being part of this ecological  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:15):**  farming revolution that's going on. We need to engage all parts of the supply chain with  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:19):**  ideas like companion cropping so that millers and bakers also discover ways that this added  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:24):**  diversity might add to what they are producing. The story we heard of the small food bakery  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:29):**  is the perfect example of this. At the end of a fascinating and thought-provoking  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:33):**  day we hear again from Sophie and John as they look back over the event.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:38):**  Yes lots to take away from it, I mean I like to do all those things, I like to mintill,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:44):**  I like to do combi cropping, the jury is out on whether I want a chameleon drill I'll see.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:50):**  One of the big positives is I really like the conversations and the exchange of information  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:24:58):**  ideas between not just organic farmers but non-organic farmers as well. I think it's  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:04):**  a really artificial divide that's built up, you know organics taking the moral high ground  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:11):**  which is always a really dangerous thing to do and actually a lot of the innovation in  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:17):**  machinery and plant science is all due to the conventional guys. So thank you and they're  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:25):**  the ones developing robotics and things which I'm really looking forward to and likewise  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:30):**  they're now thinking oh gosh maybe we need to do cover crops, maybe we need to you know  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:35):**  use leguminous lays and bring cattle back and if the organic sector hadn't kept all  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:43):**  that expertise and knowledge alive and well it you know might not be there to call on.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:51):**  Let's do more together and be less judgemental about each other.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:55):**  I think what was really interesting about the discussion today and I would say something  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:25:58):**  that's never happened at Organic Cereals before is you had a panel of two conventional farmers  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:03):**  and two organic farmers and I don't think it's happened before, I might be wrong. What  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:08):**  was so exciting and I've sort of been feeling this before the event but it really compounded  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:13):**  it was that a lot of the language that farmers that are seeking a biological system rather  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:20):**  than a chemical one we're beginning to talk the same language. I mean obviously in organic  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:24):**  farming we get a price premium, we don't want them messing around with our price premium  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:28):**  but at the end of the day actually we're all trying to achieve the same thing which is  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:32):**  a sustainable rotation which doesn't impact on environment too heavily and also builds  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:39):**  soil fertility so you know very exciting.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:42):**  Some great themes emerged from the day. The value of knowledge sharing amongst all farmers  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:46):**  organic and non-organic to build resilience into businesses. The need for more citizen  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:52):**  science and on-farm research to help the sector to develop. And finally how important it is  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:26:58):**  to engage the whole supply chain. We've heard how farmers are excited to be working with  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:02):**  ecological methods, diversity and maybe even planting populations but it will only be viable  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:09):**  if the market takes this journey with them. That was the beauty of NOCC, everyone from  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:14):**  the whole system was there in one place, excited to work together to create delicious nutritious  
**[0:27:19-0:27:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:19):**  products that are good for people and the earth.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:28):**  Thank you for listening. We're excited that Organic Farmers and Growers commissioned this  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:31):**  episode. OFNG is the largest certifier of organic land in the UK, working with producers  
**[0:27:37-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:37):**  and processors to ensure their products meet the highest organic standards.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:49):**  This episode was produced by me, Abby Rose, with Joe Barrett and Katie Reville. Thanks  
**[0:27:54-0:28:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/nocc-final#t=0:27:54):**  for listening.

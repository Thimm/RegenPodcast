**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:17):**  We revisit rewilding and how it fits into the farming landscape.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:22):**  Then it's back to a regenerative farm to hear how they are working with nature to build

**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:31):**  Finally, we hear from a Malawian reverend about the connections between their faith,  
**[0:00:36-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:36):**  farming and agro-ecological principles.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:44):**  The Sustainable Cooperative, or SCOOP, in Jersey aim to create a more sustainable supply  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:50):**  of food on the island.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:51):**  They have a plastic free shop where both those buying food and those supplying it are members.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:00:56):**  Co-founder India Hamilton wanted to make sure that ecological farmers had a clear route  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:01):**  to market and that people had access to more affordable, healthy local food.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:07):**  It's a co-operative of conscientious consumers, people in Jersey who really care about the  
**[0:01:13-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:13):**  environment and they've come together to support the small organic farmer.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:21):**  I got back to Jersey and I was reading around the subject, there was loads of different  
**[0:01:27-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:27):**  stuff going on around pollutants and water, really progressive research and big companies,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:39):**  big sort of supermarkets coming in and taking over local businesses.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:43):**  But I noticed one statistic which didn't quite work out, which was organic farming had dropped  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:48):**  by 80% in five years and I knew that organic farming globally was on the up and from a  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:01:55):**  supply and demand level I knew that something was more complicated and something different  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:01):**  was going on.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:02):**  So we went to find out what it was.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:05):**  I was very lucky to come across this lady called Laura Santa Maria who looks at regenerative  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:12):**  system design and she helped me understand across multi-stakeholders within the community  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:19):**  how you kind of ask questions to align an agenda in a way.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:26):**  And so we did a bit of that and asked kind of targeted questions around problems and  
**[0:02:34-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:34):**  we realised that almost every level, if it's a local only campaign or how regularly restaurants  
**[0:02:42-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:42):**  print menus or the size of a wholesaler, each element were marginalising the smaller farmer.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:51):**  It was a little bit of serendipity because at the same time I met a couple called Casper  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:02:57):**  and Susanna Wimbley and they had started an agricultural art project there where they  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:02):**  had invited artists from around the world to come in and interpret artistically the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:10):**  agriculture locally demanding a sort of grassroots understanding.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:15):**  And so they were sort of gathering understanding from the community.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:20):**  I had come from this sort of food systems solutions background, kind of chefing background  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:29):**  and I'd met a few farmers like Justin from Amble Farm and we all sort of got together  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:34):**  at one point and we decided to, we can't ask the farmers to do anything if there isn't  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:41):**  a shop and if there's a shop and a market, let's get going on this.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:45):**  So we just went for it and crowdfunded this idea of sort of aggregating the market to  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:53):**  support those farmers.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:03:56):**  Well we're all a bit last minute, so the day before getting it going we were up all  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:01):**  night, we had not only crowded the money but also the people to do it.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:07):**  Nothing was bought in terms of the shop's infrastructure, it was all upcycled material  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:14):**  from pallet boards but Casper who designed the shop has got a very high standard.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:19):**  So we were sanding and using V Polish wax and getting it to an incredibly almost ridiculous  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:26):**  high spec.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:27):**  We sort of set a standard of quality, about 120 people came and we were pretty entrenched  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:34):**  in stress and tears.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:37):**  But going forward from that we learnt really quickly that when you're working with food  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:44):**  you're basically working with things that are dying and you have to be good at it and  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:48):**  you have to have a good cycle and you have to work very closely with your suppliers.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:04:53):**  We'd launched with 350 different products and none of us had really done this before.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:00):**  And so it's been a really steep learning curve and we have now about just shy of 500  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:07):**  products.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:08):**  We're completely plastic free or single use free and it's been very interesting to watch  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:15):**  people really slow down.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:17):**  I mean our till system makes you really slow down.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:20):**  We have about six or seven very committed volunteers and some amazing staff to keep  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:29):**  it going.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:30):**  It's nice.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:33):**  When you remove all the packaging people call it bulk buying but actually it's precision  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:38):**  buying and it means you've got this, you've all of a sudden got this cost management to  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:45):**  organic food that people who are low income can afford because they're all of a sudden  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:49):**  buying five peas worth of something for a meal so they can price their organic food  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:54):**  in.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:05:55):**  So sometimes in our queue we'll have someone who's driven in a really fancy car with kids  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:01):**  from private school and then a few people who are on low income and they all pay a sliding  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:07):**  scale of membership and everyone equally gets 25% off or you're a non-member and then you  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:13):**  just pay the full whack.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:17):**  Casper and Susanna had lived in Germany and it was a membership model that they had seen  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:23):**  work in terms of monthly payments.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:27):**  We had noticed that a lot of farm shops locally had suffered or disappeared when supermarkets  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:33):**  came in and we wanted to create a model where if people wanted that convenience and that  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:38):**  choice of supermarkets they could go that day and it not affect us so we wanted to be  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:42):**  pre-paid and cover our basic bills and our staffing.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:47):**  We don't co-op the farmers, we want to pay what they ask for and we want them to sell  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:53):**  to any market.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:54):**  We want to take their surplus, we want to kind of be as easy for them as possible.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:06:59):**  Some farmers are really jowling with us, other farmers are kind of too big and then support  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:06):**  us when we need it.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:09):**  I think in a couple of years time when they're getting more and more confident to grow and  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:14):**  extend the season and actually probably grow less potatoes.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:17):**  Jersey's got a very strong potato land use directive which impacts our biodiversity.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:26):**  But what's really fun is we've got a couple of really small farmers who have huge diversity  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:32):**  and they'll just come in and drop off a kilo of a yacon or akaroo or something crazy or  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:39):**  quinoa or amaranth and they're so excited but we will sell it.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:44):**  Co-ops are really interesting to run.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:48):**  People put a lot of time into them.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:49):**  I suppose this is kind of a learning curve and if someone integral makes you turn on  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:07:56):**  it, it's actually how you value that effort putting in.

**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:07):**  Autumn Heritage not as some sort of gimmick but I see them as low input cereals.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:12):**  So we spend a lot of time sourcing different products from gene banks, multiplying them  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:16):**  up over 3 or 4 years before we grow them out on big acreage and get other farmers to grow  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:21):**  them for us as well.

**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:27):**  As we get to the end of the field we've got, we just had about 3 quarters of an acre left  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:32):**  over so I went back to the grain store and chucked all the seeds that I had left over  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:39):**  from cover crops and herbal lays and cereals and pulses, put them in the drill and just  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:45):**  drilled it and actually now we're stood here in, when is it, end of May and it looks absolutely  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:51):**  fantastic.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:52):**  Absolutely humming when you walk through.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:54):**  It's a really visceral experience actually isn't it?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:18:57):**  Very addictive way of farming when you start.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:01):**  And then there's sort of basically a, we call it a brook, that runs right through the middle  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:06):**  of the farm, I guess like a kind of artery and the way I see the farm moving forward  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:11):**  would be that being kind of like, almost like imagine a delta, what a delta looks like and  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:17):**  then from this brook which is the kind of permanent refuge area for all the beneficials,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:23):**  arteries and veins run from this throughout into the fields each side either in the form  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:31):**  of like buffer strips against the brook but then dividing some fields up using hedgerows  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:39):**  and then some of the larger fields kind of agroforestry so you've got arteries running  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:44):**  from the mainstream.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:47):**  So I guess like a leaf or a delta, that kind of image.  
**[0:19:50-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:19:50):**  The whole theory being that to build resilience into your system you have to have some permanent  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:00):**  areas of high biological diversity, I guess nature and on our farm at the moment those  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:08):**  pockets aren't linked and they're not close enough together so I see a farm in the future  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:13):**  where you're never more than 50 meters away from one of those pockets so that if you have  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:19):**  a block of arable crop all the beneficials that you've built up in these permanent areas  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:25):**  have access to that area which you're kind of drawing down on the fertility or the good  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:30):**  work that you're doing but without drawing down on the biodiversity.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:35):**  So that's kind of how I see the farm and I see the brook where we stood now is a real  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:39):**  like kind of source for all of those tributaries to go out into the more kind of commercial  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:47):**  arable cropping, that's how I would see it.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:51):**  Can you just tell me a little bit about the 50 meter theory and for example maybe talk  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:56):**  about it in the context of that bean field that we can see?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:20:59):**  Yeah so most of the things I've come across, in fact all of the things, none of them are  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:05):**  my ideas but I've applied them when I've seen first hand something going wrong.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:12):**  So my whole understanding of soil fertility changed when I had a whole half the farm go  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:18):**  flat, the cereals weren't flat because the nutrient resource efficiency of the cereals  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:23):**  was greater than I anticipated year on year and so it made me really think about what  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:27):**  was going on under the soil.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:28):**  Similarly I've had an experience this year where I've got 18 acres of spring beans that  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:34):**  we use as part of the pig diet and as along with our no fungicide no nitrogen policy we  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:41):**  also have a no insecticide policy.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:43):**  So about three weeks after the beans emerged they were experiencing notching on the leaves  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:48):**  so that's basically pea and bean weevil pest.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:55):**  Now I could have just gone out with a sprayer and sprayed it and sorted the problem but  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:21:58):**  I've lost probably a third of the field but when you look at the field it's just remarkable,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:03):**  it's actually quite a long thin field, it's mostly headland but genuinely a strip through  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:09):**  the middle of the field, i.e. the furthest point from any of the hedgerows and permanent  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:13):**  refuge areas is the bit that's been hammered and affected.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:17):**  I mean typically your headlands are your worst parts of your field with compaction and where  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:21):**  you're turning and that kind of thing and so it's an absolute visual example of where  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:26):**  we're trying to get to.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:27):**  If we can make every part of the farm easily accessible because I think something I've  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:32):**  heard and read is these beneficials can migrate 50 meters from wherever they are based and  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:39):**  so that field is a perfect example.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:41):**  I'm not saying the beans on the outside haven't been affected but in terms of the impact on

**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:50):**  I think that's the whole model that we're moving to, much more accepting lower yields  
**[0:22:54-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:22:54):**  but at no cost and those yields are always the same amount lower.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:02):**  So 15 or 10% lower rather than the kind of boom or bust swings that we see at the moment.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:08):**  So I guess I just have to accept that field how it looks at the moment and take a 10 year  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:12):**  view and say back myself that we won't be getting that in 10 years time.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:16):**  But it's tough at the moment because we're neither organic nor conventional, we're somewhere  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:21):**  in between, we've created red lines for ourselves because I want to find out and push the system

**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:23:35):**  Finally we have another report from Jonny Hanson at Jubilee Farm in conversation with

**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:14):**  Minister but he is also a trainer in conservation agriculture.

**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:27):**  We are doing a project in the northern part of Malawi in a community called Chirida where  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:33):**  this was the community that has been devastated with hunger for several years.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:38):**  We looked at that as a problem and upon searching and trying to find the answers we discovered  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:45):**  that the best method that could fit the community was what we call foundations for farming which  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:50):**  is based on four cornerstones that we use for teaching.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:54):**  The first one is we teach people to be on time all the time because we believe that  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:24:59):**  when people they know when to do it that means they will have good harvest.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:06):**  The second cornerstone is they have to do something on a high standard, they have to  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:11):**  just do things because they want just to try but they have to do it specifically on a high  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:15):**  standard that's the recommendation.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:19):**  The third one, the third point is there should be no wastage, everything that they harvest  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:25):**  the residues must remain in the garden decompose and turn into manure.

**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:35):**  that many people in Malawi they were thinking to do farm work was a punishment so they had  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:39):**  no joy but we had to tell them that farming is the way that we are supposed to do and  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:43):**  they have to have joy doing it.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:47):**  Christians believe that the world was created by God and man was put in the world to take  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:25:56):**  care of the world therefore there should be a great relationship between Christians and  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:03):**  the creation.

**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:09):**  planted maize they needed rain and that rain is provided by God.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:15):**  They had to work on the garden they needed energy and that we believe that it came from  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:19):**  God.

**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:26):**  we have some gospel artists around our community which we have from another part who is an

**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:38):**  The main reason they celebrate is that God gave us a good weather, God gave us good rains  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/49-the-sustainable-cooperative-wilding-beneficial-insects-and-connecting-faith-with-farming#t=0:26:43):**  and he gave us good energy and it's time to celebrate and it's time for joy.

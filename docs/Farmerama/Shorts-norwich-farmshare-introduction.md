**[0:00:00-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, my name is Joel Rodka. Last year I was setting up a market garden on a farm near  Peterborough. I recorded various podcasts throughout the year, charting my journey in  trying to establish a market garden and trying to make it successful. Unfortunately, that project  
**[0:00:32-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:32):**  didn't work out for various reasons. There wasn't a particularly good relationship with the landlords.  I had some problems with the growing conditions which I don't think were going to be resolved  very quickly to do with the soil and the wind. There was no shelter on the site there. There  
**[0:00:56-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:56):**  were problems with the location because of its geography and relation to my family and also  because of personal commitments. So that came to an end at the end of last year and I decided to  leave there and move back to Norwich. Over the winter I got chatting to a friend of mine, Jack,  
**[0:01:18-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:18):**  who was working at Norwich Farm Share, which is a CSA just on the edge of Norwich. They were having  some issues with finances and Jack was only doing one day a week over the winter. So we discussed  the possibility of me joining Norwich Farm Share and both being the growers at Norwich Farm Share  
**[0:01:43-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:43):**  and that's what happened. So in March this year I joined Norwich Farm Share. I am doing two days a  week and Jack is doing two days a week. We both work Thursdays which is a harvest day and we then  work one other day. We also have a volunteer day which is also on the Thursday. So it's now August  
**[0:02:06-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:06):**  the 6th and I've been here for five months and it's going pretty well. There are lots of challenges  as they're on every farm and every new job but there's also lots of opportunities. It's got a  lot of potential as a project and as a site. We've got about three acres of land which is gently  
**[0:02:30-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:30):**  sloping and south-facing so the aspect is south-facing which means we've got sun all day.  On the east, west and north side we've got big coniferous and deciduous trees which give us  great shelter but don't shade the site. So that's excellent. The soil is pretty good, it's quite  
**[0:02:50-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:50):**  sandy but it seems to have enough fertility and we haven't really noticed any problems with plant  growth. Before I joined they had the whole site rabbit fenced and we're still dealing with rabbits  which are using holes which we haven't found. I think we may have blocked up the last hole last  
**[0:03:13-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:13):**  week and hopefully we won't have any more rabbits inside the fence but they've been a bit of a  problem and we've had some problem with birds. So the fenced-in area is about three acres and  we are probably cultivating about a quarter to half an acre. We have two big polytunnels which  
**[0:03:34-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:34):**  Jack put up last year, a smaller propagation tunnel and a small salad area. We are growing  on 30 inch or just over 80 centimeter wide beds with 40 centimeter paths at the moment. We are growing  on 25 meter beds and we have six plots of nine beds and this week we have just filled every bed.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:00):**  The main weeds that we've got are nettles and buttercup and a few others and we're just about  getting on top of them now. It's taken us the last couple of months to deal with them but they're now  sort of under control. The site is pretty good really. As an organization we are mainly a  
**[0:04:26-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:26):**  membership organization selling weekly veg boxes to we now have just over 70 members. I think at  its maximum a few years ago they had about 120 so we harvest on a Thursday take all the produce to  a collection point and then the members come and weigh out their produce and take it home. We're  
**[0:04:49-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:49):**  also starting to sell to restaurants. We don't think we've got enough members to fund ourselves  through the winter so we probably need about 90 to 100 members so that is overshadowing us a bit  at the moment but we're confident that we can recruit more members and we're hoping that we  
**[0:05:13-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:13):**  can build on the really amazing success we've had already this year in terms of how much we've grown  and just establishing systems, working in a partnership, getting new volunteers involved  and hopefully we'll have enough money to carry us through to next year and we can really start  
**[0:05:35-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:35):**  building on the foundations that were established over the last 12 months. I'll stop there. I will  try and do regular updates. It's just been non-stop since we started working together in March so  hopefully I will have a bit more time. I'm actually going away to Italy for a short break and then  
**[0:05:57-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:57):**  we'll be back for the autumn winter push so I will try and update on what we're doing on the farm,  what our plans are, what's working well, what isn't working well and how this kind of organization  works and what are the pros and cons. So hopefully you'll tune in to the next episode. Thanks for  
**[0:06:17-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:06:17):**  listening and see you next time. Bye!

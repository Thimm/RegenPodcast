**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:00):**  I'm Amy and I'm here with Kenny from Wefarm. Hi Kenny.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:08):**  Hi.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:09):**  Now can you just tell me what Wefarm is?  
**[0:00:13-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:13):**  Sure. Wefarm is a social enterprise that enables small-scale farmers, mostly without access  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:20):**  to the internet, to obtain information on anything they want sourced from the crowd.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:26):**  So using SMS predominantly as a tool at this stage with machine learning and the knowledge  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:30):**  of thousands of other farmers to get information shared across the supply chain.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:35):**  I've been nosing around your website and I saw some stories of people saving their chickens  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:40):**  and their chickens had got sick and they didn't know what was wrong and then they text in.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:45):**  There were also other stories. Are there any stories that you can share of how it works?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:51):**  Sure, yeah definitely. So mostly interactions on Wefarm start with a question or a problem  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:00:56):**  that a farmer has. You know in the example that you mentioned, we have a case study on  
**[0:01:02-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:02):**  a guy called Kefa that he's a chicken keeper, had about 60 chickens in his flock and had  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:09):**  a disease that was kind of ripping through them and killed a large number in the space  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:12):**  of a few days. So he sends an SMS for free to the local Wefarm number that starts to  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:17):**  talk about his problem. You know, my chickens have these symptoms and these problems, what  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:22):**  can I do? So Wefarm receives the message and at that point we do some machine learning  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:28):**  on the content, trying to understand what Kefa is saying to us, where he is, what he  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:33):**  farms, increasingly what the weather might be like where he is, etc. And we use that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:38):**  analysis to pick out a few people in the entire network that can answer that one particular  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:43):**  question. It goes to them via SMS and we get one or two bespoke, tailored answers back  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:49):**  to the original farmer from people we know have dealt with a similar problem or are experts  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:54):**  in that particular area.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:55):**  Fantastic. And so a text message is how many symbols?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:01:59):**  Up to 160 characters.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:02):**  Okay. And also are you dealing with different languages?  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah, so obviously a text message or SMS restricts us to some extent in terms of the content,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:15):**  but I guess that forces us on the farmers to be eloquent to a degree in how we deal  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:20):**  with things. I think the other side of that though is that we're pretty much the only  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:25):**  digital ecosystem for these farmers to use. So in context, being able to get help and  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:30):**  information even if it is only one or two SMS long is much better than the alternative.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:36):**  In terms of languages, we deal with English, Swahili, Rwanda Kwali and Lugandu. So both  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:43):**  the main languages in Uganda and Kenya as well as some of the regional languages. I  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:49):**  believe we're probably the only people in the world building natural language processing  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:52):**  libraries in some of these languages. So hopefully it will benefit people beyond just we farm.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:02:57):**  So how many SMSes would be exchanged? Is it a conversation of SMS messages that normally  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:03):**  goes on? What's an average conversation consist of?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:06):**  Yeah, so I mean many times it is just as simple as a farmer asking a question, us sharing  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:11):**  that with a few people we think can help and one or two answers going back to the original  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:15):**  farmer. Sometimes the conversation goes beyond that and more and more as we develop the products  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:20):**  trying to create a unique link between the questioner and the answerer so that follow  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:26):**  up questions or a conversation can begin. So that's the sort of stuff we're working  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:30):**  at the moment. At the moment we're sending and receiving something in the region of 3.5  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:35):**  to 4 million SMS a month. Our network has now grown to well half a million probably  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:42):**  by the time this goes out sometime in the next few days.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:45):**  And how does it grow? How does your network grow?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:49):**  Some mixture of different things. We use radio quite a lot as a medium to spread the word.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:03:55):**  We do a lot of content driven radio where farmers can call in and talk to us and we  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:00):**  find that really effective. We also have agents, ambassadors as we call them on the ground  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:05):**  that help us to build trust in the community and teach farmers how to use it and that's  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:09):**  a really effective model for us. And increasingly we see word of mouth being really powerful  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:13):**  so farmers who have been using the service can tell a friend about it which is obviously  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:17):**  really important for us as we really to scale.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:20):**  And so when did you kick off and what's been the growth rate of?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:26):**  So we launched in February 2015. I remember our first 10 users by name. And since then  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:34):**  we've been growing probably somewhere in an average of about 10% month on month. And if  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:40):**  you look at our growth curve it's really accelerated rapidly in the last few months. We're starting  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:44):**  to hit not quite exponential growth but in the communities that we're working with which  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:49):**  are often offline it is the equivalent of exponential growth. I think more important  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:55):**  for us though isn't just people signing up it's that they actually use it. So on the  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:04:59):**  average month about 30 to 40% of the users are actively contributing content, questions  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:05):**  and answers which is astronomically high if you compare that to most of the social networks  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:10):**  that we see in the Western world. So we're very pleased with that and believe we're probably  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:15):**  the first people to ever create this kind of significant growth and then engagement  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:19):**  digitally with offline communities.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:22):**  And in the back end you must be collecting loads of clever stuff about farming like lots  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:29):**  of… what are you doing with that? What do you imagine will be the outcome of those things?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah, I mean data is obviously hugely important for us. I mean personally I believe that's  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:40):**  where our game changing social impact comes from. The data obviously on top of the individual  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:45):**  help we can give to farmers but it's also where our commercial model comes in. Obviously  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:50):**  these farmers that we're working with farm the vast majority of the world's supply  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:53):**  chain, the origin of many of the commodities markets so the data and forecasting that we  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:05:58):**  can do across tens of thousands of conversations is really exciting. On the social side we're  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:03):**  looking at things like tracking disease. Can we use machine learning and the symptoms of  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:08):**  a disease to pick out trends that might indicate a break of food and mouth disease or army  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:12):**  worm and help local authorities to deal with that, NGOs, whoever it might be. We can probably  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:19):**  see that in an hour where otherwise it might take weeks to come to light. On the commercial  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:23):**  side looking at things like ripening periods, also disease patterns that might affect the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:28):**  supply chains of some of the multinationals or the commodities markets. Not sacrificing  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:33):**  or giving away any individual data on any farmers but looking at the trends of what  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:37):**  happens across massive numbers of conversations. And also then building that back into the  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:42):**  product so it helps the farmers. So if a farmer asks a question on planting carrots in a particular  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:48):**  region of Kenya we have a lot of historical data on other farmers who've done similar  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:52):**  things and can help to guide people based on data rather than just hearsay. And obviously  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:06:58):**  we've seen a lot of change in agriculture over even just a relatively short period like  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:04):**  30 years. And actually the amount of data that we collected about farming has been relatively  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:11):**  recent and has always been from large scale farming. So I can see how exciting it is to  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:15):**  collect from these smaller, I mean do they tend to be smaller scale farms that you're  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:20):**  doing or quite a variety? I mean we don't stop anyone from using the system as long  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:24):**  as they're using it responsibly. But yeah the vast majority of our farmers are small  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:27):**  scale farmers between half a hectare and four or five hectares is where the majority would  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:32):**  lie. So I know that there's a lot of excitement about being able to collect data from small  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:38):**  holder farmers and also make the accessible the knowledge that they haven't been able  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:45):**  to share before. One of the things that I spoke to one of your colleagues about was  
**[0:07:52-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:07:52):**  how do you make sure that there's like a variety of information. So if someone comes in to  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:01):**  market a product and they approach 100 of your farmers and they get on your, and so  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:06):**  the farmers are talking about this product which may or may not be a great product but  
**[0:08:11-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:11):**  how do you prevent your system or is that something you won't get involved with? So  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:19):**  I mean yeah I mean there's I guess a wide range of examples where people could be sharing  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:24):**  you know potentially inappropriate content. I guess we look at dealing with that in a  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:28):**  couple of different ways. First and foremost you know with technology. So obviously we  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:34):**  have spam filters and can very quickly pick out keywords that are you know obviously inappropriate  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:40):**  for sending. More and more we use more sophisticated machine learning to actually detect intent  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:47):**  rather than just keywords. You know once you start looking at cross languages you know  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:51):**  a word that might be you know rude in Swahili or English isn't in another language it's  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:56):**  something that sounds very similar so more and more we have to look at the intent of  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:08:59):**  what the message is trying to say and the same mechanism that helps us understand whether  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:03):**  a farmer is talking about this breed of chicken or another breed of chicken can help us understand  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:07):**  if they're talking about something political or something that we wouldn't necessarily  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:11):**  want to share. The other side of it is then having the crowd be involved in this. I mean  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:17):**  this goes back to the entire ethos of We Farm and what makes our data really special is  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:20):**  it's coming from people naturally. We're not extracting it, we're not asking people questions  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:25):**  or filling in surveys, we're just letting people talk naturally between themselves and  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:29):**  empowering the crowd to also be filters of information and you know what's inappropriate  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:34):**  and what's not is really important. I think people get pretty protective about the system  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:38):**  you know when people share things that aren't agricultural related there's always somebody  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:41):**  very quickly saying you know this is not about farming.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:46):**  So people have that already on your system so people because I was interested how many  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:51):**  people see the messages because they're coming I'm imagining everyone sat on a pretty much  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:09:56):**  text based phone and they're just seeing they send in a message and then they'll just receive  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:03):**  a response but also how are they getting the questions directed to them?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:07):**  So the average user will receive something in the region between one and two questions  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:12):**  a week depending on how engaged they are and you know obviously we look at the data of  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:15):**  you know if we sent somebody 400 questions over the previous two years and they haven't  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:19):**  answered any of them you know it's probably not worth sending them any more questions.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:24):**  On the other end of the scale we have users that are highly engaged. We have an ask me  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:28):**  function where users can request questions and we see some users that sit and answer  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:33):**  questions you know for half an hour or an hour and it's you know that's really exciting  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:37):**  so I mean how many messages people get really depends on their own activity levels and what  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:42):**  they want but the average question is probably being seen by somewhere between 10 and 20  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:47):**  people at the moment. We expect that one or two will answer it statistically and obviously  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:53):**  within that there's people that will report bad content or flag inappropriate things as  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:56):**  well.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:10:57):**  So internally you have a kind of user assessment of how well a user is performing as a question  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:06):**  answer and as someone who's actually asking questions and partaking but it's rather than  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:12):**  in a social media everyone's almost rating each other much more publicly.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:18):**  And so how has that been for you trying to work out what is seen as like a high rated  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:24):**  individual on your platform?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:27):**  Yeah that's an interesting question I mean the mechanics of what we're doing behind the  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:30):**  scenes are often very similar to the social networks that we know but obviously our interface  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:35):**  is very different in terms of SMS. So not entirely different we're looking at and experimenting  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:41):**  with many different ways of getting users to rate things whether that's just a simple  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:44):**  did this answer your question yes or no to you know can you rate this out of 10 and we're  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:49):**  doing experiments at the moment to see you know which of those users you know respond  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:53):**  to the best which of them work but I think that kind of crowd verification is really  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:58):**  important to us.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:11:59):**  You know we're already getting way beyond the volumes of content that we can have humans  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:03):**  analyze and that's obviously only going to increase so we need a mixture of smart technology  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:08):**  and engaged users to do that for us.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:10):**  I guess the analogy I would probably use is eBay where you know eBay can't possibly verify  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:15):**  the millions of products that are going through their system so they have the crowd verify  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:19):**  that you can safely buy a t-shirt from this person because other users have verified that  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:24):**  they you know describe it well they send it on time you know we're essentially building  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:28):**  the same for information that you know we can't necessarily tell you this is a perfect  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:32):**  rabbit answer but we can tell you that this person knows a lot about rabbits.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:37):**  And what countries are you operating in at the moment?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:40):**  So currently we're only in Kenya and Uganda we now have I think about 7% of all the farms  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:44):**  in Kenya and Uganda using the system as we grow quickly we're adding Tanzania early next  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:50):**  year and then looking at various other sub-Saharan Africa and Asian countries over the next two  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:56):**  years.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:12:57):**  And how did you decide where to start?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:00):**  Yeah I'd like to say that was a really smart analysis and such like but partly coincidence  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:05):**  we were already working on the ground with farmers in Kenya and Uganda we knew some of  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:10):**  the cooperatives there through Wefarm's origins as a project an NGO the Cafe Direct Producers  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:16):**  Foundation that I was working with so you know we already had the context to be able  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:22):**  to do the first launch and I guess the East African ecosystem you know SMS is a huge product  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:29):**  there mobile money people are already comfortable with doing things through SMS so it was a  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:34):**  really great place for us to launch.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:36):**  Do you think that we might end up seeing something like this for UK farmers?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:41):**  We do get quite a lot of interest and requests to do things in the Western world I mean at  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:46):**  the moment the reality is there are much more sophisticated farm management systems in place  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:50):**  for farmers in the Western world that have internet access and the capital to be able  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:55):**  to do that.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:13:56):**  That being said I think what Wefarm does uniquely is have that sense of community and talking  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:00):**  to each other which is something that I think a lot of Western world farmers actually relate  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:04):**  to so at the moment I think our focus is very much on the developing world but you know  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:09):**  it would be interesting to do something outside of that as well.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:15):**  Is there anything in terms of have you got any feedback from a farmer of the impacts  
**[0:14:23-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:23):**  on maybe meeting up physically with other farmers or do any farmers I'd really like  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:32):**  to hear a story of where it worked really well and maybe ones where you've really had  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:36):**  to work to solve a problem maybe where people weren't sharing or they were trying to sort  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:41):**  of sabotage are there any stories of?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:44):**  I don't know of any stories of sabotage maybe yet to come.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:48):**  I mean definitely we have plenty of case studies of farmers who've used it and really benefited  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:52):**  from it you know from Kefa our chicken farmer to we were doing a case study recently with  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:14:57):**  a tea farmer called Michael in Kenya that he'd been asking various questions on fertilization  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:03):**  techniques on pruning which is really important in tea plants and when to do that the spacing  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:08):**  between these new plants and over a year of using the system he got pretty close to doubling  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:14):**  not quite about a 90% increase in his average tea yield which is obviously a fantastic result  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:21):**  for us and shows what's possible and we have you know various stories of that.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:24):**  We actually recently introduced a feedback function on the system where a user can send  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:29):**  us feedback on anything that they want to just by starting their message with feedback  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:34):**  that comes directly into our slack channel in the office so we get to see every piece  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:38):**  of feedback that a user has left and it's I have to be honest the majority of it is  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:43):**  really positive people's you know freely sending us information about the things they've taken  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:49):**  from the system obviously like anything the occasional pieces of constructive feedback  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:52):**  as well you know we're still an early stage company and there's a lot of progress for  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:15:57):**  us to make but we're getting there.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:00):**  Can you imagine posting out experiments or challenges with the idea that you're now starting  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:07):**  to gather all this information can you imagine actually sending out experiments that many  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:13):**  people try in different areas and see what comes back?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:17):**  To farmers you mean?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:19):**  I mean we get a lot of interest in us sending things out to farmers whether that's you know  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:24):**  from a quite crude angle of advertising to you know obviously looking at much more of  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:29):**  the data side of things and social experiments.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:33):**  I think what's quite important for us is as you know we grow and build the trust of the  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:38):**  farmer is to minimize the top down voice as much as possible so we try to send as little  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:43):**  content to farmers as possible and really make it a community thing.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:48):**  You know trust is hugely important you know everywhere but especially in rural African  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:51):**  communities.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:53):**  We are the first digital system that the vast majority of these farmers will ever use so  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:16:58):**  I think it's really important and a big responsibility on us to make sure that we're being responsible  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:01):**  with that.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:02):**  But I think the possibilities of getting interesting social data out of this that are helpful to  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:07):**  NGOs and to local communities themselves are huge you know for example we can look at the  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:15):**  rates of which young people under the age of 30 are planting coffee versus tea and start  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:20):**  to look at trends in that or what are the problems that a 20 year old farmer is talking  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:23):**  about versus a 50 year old farmer, men and women and the gender differences in that and  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:30):**  you know that's all really powerful data for governments and local authorities.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:35):**  With the data sharing where do you draw the lines of where this anonymous but accumulated  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:44):**  big data who can get their hands on it?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:48):**  I mean I think this is still early days and you know as I said the first and foremost  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:52):**  for us is the trust of the farmer.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:17:55):**  The reality is that none of it works unless farmers trust us and do so for the long term.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:00):**  You know we also have shareholders in the business which is the NGO which you know we  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:05):**  first created WeFarm which is owned by the farmers themselves so we have a kind of direct  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:09):**  link in our very structure back to the farming communities.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:13):**  In terms of data specifically I think that's really a case by case basis for us at the  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:17):**  moment.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:18):**  You know our commitment to users is we never give away anyone's personal information and  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:21):**  have no intention of doing so at any point and you know we would certainly look at any  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:27):**  aggregated data that the farmers is something we would want to get involved in but you know  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:32):**  the vast percent of what we do is very anonymized and a very big scale so it isn't really particularly  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:39):**  relevant in that sense to any individual farmer.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:43):**  And with the NGO does that mean that you have a board who sits on the board of your NGO?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:50):**  So the NGO has a board of trustees which includes I think three small scale farmers these days.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:18:56):**  They're a shareholder in WeFarm and have a board seat on WeFarm.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:00):**  We also have venture capital investment now.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:03):**  We are a social enterprise but a commercial company so we are hopefully building the best  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:09):**  of both worlds.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:10):**  And how long have you been involved in WeFarm and how did you end up here?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:17):**  It's a relatively long story I'll try to keep it short.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:20):**  Yeah I've only got a few minutes now.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah I spent many years working in Latin America mostly in structure and engineering projects  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:29):**  with rural communities.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:30):**  I built fish farms and water systems mostly with indigenous communities in the high Andes  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:34):**  and Amazon basin and obviously spent a lot of time working with farming communities and  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:42):**  I guess seeing a lot of the top down attitude that was taken to information sharing.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:46):**  You know a lot of people you know it's obviously widely recognized this issue of people not  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:50):**  having access to information but being honest most people come at it as well we'll just  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:54):**  tell poor people what to do.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:19:56):**  And I think really saw the opportunity to do something very different and working with  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:00):**  small scale farmers under the NGO a few years ago we kind of started to develop what would  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:05):**  become WeFarm and people were really excited about those ideas and being able to share  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:09):**  their own knowledge and information.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:12):**  And then in 2015 we took the decision to spin it out as a social enterprise and haven't  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:17):**  looked back since.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:18):**  Amazing.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:19):**  I feel like I've got everything I need but is there anything else that you think, how  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:25):**  many people work for WeFarm at the moment?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:28):**  At the moment we're 24 at the moment with a kind of core team based here in London that's  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:33):**  mostly senior management, data science, developers and then we have awesome teams on the ground  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:40):**  in Uganda and Kenya and they mostly look at the marketing side of things, the engagement  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:46):**  with our users and agricultural knowledge and working with the farmers themselves.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:52):**  We are in the midst of doing another funding round at the moment.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:20:55):**  Hopefully on the back of that we'll probably be doubling in size over the next year.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:00):**  We hope to reach about 3 million farmers with that.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:05):**  So we're excited about the next 12 to 18 months.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:09):**  Great.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:10):**  And one thing that came up when we were chatting at this conference was have you ever thought  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:15):**  about giving them all weather systems and collecting the weather data?  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:22):**  Yes very much so.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:23):**  I think our core vision for WeFarm is to become a complete digital ecosystem.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:28):**  So at the moment it's very much based around questions and answers and information but  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:33):**  we're really working on products that take that core and build other services for farmers  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:37):**  around them.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:39):**  So whether that's the farmer being able to trade things through WeFarm or have access  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:43):**  to loans or fertilisers or simple things such as weather, we're very open to all of that.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:49):**  Ultimately we'd like farmers to see WeFarm as a trusted source of information for everything.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:21:58):**  So Farmerama has a global community of small scale farmers and also innovators and tech  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:06):**  designers.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:07):**  Is there anything that you would like to, any challenges that you have at the moment  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:12):**  that you think they might be able to...  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:15):**  We have enough challenges to keep people going for the next decade I think.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:20):**  If anyone is willing to help us or wants to know more or get involved we have a contact  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:26):**  us page on our website at WeFarm.org.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:30):**  I'm very happy to speak with anyone who wants to get involved.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:34):**  Perfect thank you so much Kenny.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-shorts-wefarm#t=0:22:36):**  Thank you.

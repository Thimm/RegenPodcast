### Farmerama  (2019-02-24)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to episode 43 of Farmerama.  This month we turn to a much loved friend of the show for some wisdom on cattle management.  We get an introduction to the whole food system approach that is silver pasture and we kick  
**[0:00:21-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:00:21):**  back in Sicily tasting some natural wine.  But first we turn to Deb Moses, a new farmer based near Madison, Wisconsin.  Deb champions the cause of involving the very young in food growing, a transformative experience  
**[0:00:43-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:00:43):**  that she discovered when she became a mother.  I started working with gardening and really young children when my son was born.  Before then I didn't have a lot of relationships with really young children for the most part  
**[0:00:56-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:00:56):**  and I had no idea how smart they were and how early on they were so smart and I thought  oh well you can't teach a kid anything until they're at least in kindergarten but I was  so wrong and he helped open my eyes to how much one learns especially by experience and  
**[0:01:12-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:01:12):**  tasting and touching and smelling and how well that lends itself to gardening and food  exploration and your taste preferences are developing at that age and just the excitement  and everything's new and how wonderful that was.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:01:27):**  So an opportunity came where I was in Colorado to do a little bit of work around farm to  preschool or what's called now farm to early care and education because it encompasses  zero to five and it was just magical to see children that would try something especially  
**[0:01:43-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:01:43):**  that they had grown and little children eating things I never would have guessed like fennel  and cabbage and sort of that peer pressure, positive peer pressure in groups of small  children if they all grew it and they all pulled it out of the ground and they all tried  
**[0:01:57-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:01:57):**  it together it was really magical.  A lot of teachers especially if they haven't done any gardening in the past there is a  fear of not knowing what to do and so to help get over that fear it's wonderful to know  
**[0:02:09-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:02:09):**  that you are actually a great candidate to learn with the children if you don't know  anything in fact you're better if you don't know anything because you don't have preconceived  notions and it's all an experiment and it's all a learning experience with children and  
**[0:02:24-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:02:24):**  you can model for them what it's like to try something new and to say we're going to put  these carrot seeds in the ground and we're going to water them and we're going to see  what happens and to know that even if it fails even if you don't have carrots grow you can  
**[0:02:36-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:02:36):**  usually always dig down and find some worms or you can you know say I wonder why this  happened who can we ask for advice or if a rabbit comes and eats your carrots it's a  great chance to pull out some books about rabbits and learn about rabbits so there's  
**[0:02:49-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:02:49):**  always a learning opportunity and to never be or to try to not be afraid if you don't  know that it's actually a good thing but otherwise just yeah starting small keeping it simple  even a couple things in pots one child at my son's center they didn't have much room  
**[0:03:05-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:03:05):**  for garden so they just had one small pot on their playground and they planted some  beet seeds that morning and this boy was notorious for being very selective in his eating didn't  ever want to try anything new it was very very picky and they offered him some beets  
**[0:03:21-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:03:21):**  on a salad actually that that morning and he said I'm not going to eat it and they said  well actually this is what you just planted this morning and these are beets and he said  oh okay I'll try it and he not only tried it he loved it and asked for a second helping  
**[0:03:35-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:03:35):**  so it happens that transformation happens that fast you didn't even see it sprout he  didn't pull it out of the ground but just that connection so the garden doesn't have  to be big it doesn't have to be a production but it really really makes a difference.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:03:48):**  Some partners of ours work in the inner city of Milwaukee and they've been able to help  get like a CSA share for some of the child cares that are in this inner city or especially  places that don't have any room for a garden but they have like a little space for like  
**[0:04:01-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:04:01):**  a few pots and the children have just been really enjoying some of this fresh food that  they've really never even had a chance to even experience or have any idea how it grows  and that this is a great example of a woman that's she's a teacher and she she's been  
**[0:04:15-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:04:15):**  cutting up cabbage and just kind of frying it in a little bit of butter and the kids  love it and they've been trying kohlrabi they've been trying beets all the range is one of  their favorite things is they love saying it but they're just trying all these amazing  
**[0:04:29-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:04:29):**  things and it's just a matter of giving it a shot and and just having having that be  an available option so hopefully especially more and more children that are separated  from the land and from being able to understand these things even small things can can make  
**[0:04:45-0:04:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:04:45):**  a big difference.  Where my son was going there was a local CSA farmer and he did provide them with a basket  that he gave them at a discounted rate to sort of get them interested.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:04:58):**  It went pretty well although they ended up ultimately just buying a few products from  him wholesale but in the meantime the kids had a lot of fun trying the new things and  the cook had an interesting time trying the new things which sometimes they need a little  
**[0:05:09-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:05:09):**  guidance too but it works out but a neat thing that he did also was anybody from the center  that bought a CSA they bought a CSA membership part of the sales from that would go towards  discounting it for the center.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:05:23):**  He also gave a slight deal to the the families and so but then also made that connection  between what the kids get at school and what the kids get at home and he didn't get to  start this but there is a possibility having like a CSA pickup site at a center to also  
**[0:05:36-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:05:36):**  like facilitate that and make it more viable part of your business.  As a grower if you grow just think about early care facilities in your growing.  What's wonderful is that they're often open year-round so they can purchase things in  
**[0:05:51-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:05:51):**  the peak of growing season.  There's many different sizes so there's different models there's family daycares that are just  you know five kids and then there's other sites that are like a hundred children so  
**[0:06:01-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:06:01):**  it's really neat to be able to match your operation to that size especially if you're  more small scale and a great way to approach them is to just go to the center and bring  some veggies and just have a conversation about what do they use most often maybe it's  
**[0:06:16-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:06:16):**  a specialized CSA where they can try things maybe it's just selling them carrots and  lettuce or things that they might use more often it's a relationship like anything else  but it's really a great outlet to consider.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:06:29):**  If you're a farmer or a grower maybe you're already working with a local nursery or a  daycare center either as a supplier or in an educational capacity or both.  If so get in touch we'd love to hear more of these stories.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:06:50):**  Greg Judy is an enthusiastic mob grazer based in Missouri.  We featured him back in episode 36 and you'll also find a brilliant short on our feed that  focuses on his ideas on mob grazing.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:07:02):**  Abby bumped into Greg again at the Savannah Institute Perennial Gathering in Wisconsin  in the United States.  He explained to her how his herd remineralized the land for him and a few other grazing tips.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:07:17):**  This was recorded in a hotel lobby so please do excuse the background noise.  Basically Abby what we're doing is we're trying to focus on what happens in nature  and I'm back up to this.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:07:32):**  We try and look at our operation what would happen before a white man arrived with a firearm  and basically we want to inject our expertise we want to put a crutch underneath all our  animals you know make sure they perform and what we've done is just the opposite.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:07:52):**  We've pulled all the crutches out of our cows.  We don't worm, we don't use antibiotics, we don't feed them any grain.  Any animal that can't give us a calf on grass is history we just get rid of them.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:08:02):**  So I feel like unless you are the predator the owner of that flock or herd should be  the predator.  If you aren't willing to get rid of the animals that don't work you're never going to have  
**[0:08:12-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:08:12):**  a good sustainable herd.  We're actually letting the animals select from a free choice enterprise system where  we have 16 different minerals and they're all in their individual boxes and what this  
**[0:08:29-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:08:29):**  does is the animals as they're rotating around the farms if they go into a pasture that let's  say doesn't have magnesium in the grasses or in the soil the animals can go to that  box and select what they need and an animal poops out about 80% of that mineral back onto  
**[0:08:47-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:08:47):**  the farm and so over time by having the animals have selection they select what's missing  onto your paddock and so we call that herd our Traven Laboratory.  Here's the thing when you feed minerals in a complete mineral where they're all mixed  
**[0:09:06-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:09:06):**  together in one animals may go after sulfur and in the process of taking in trying to  get the sulfur they actually over eat on let's say phosphorus and the phosphorus ties up  the use of what they were after which would be this you know whatever and so you're really  
**[0:09:26-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:09:26):**  not doing anything.  I mean you're actually hurting the animal because they're eating a bunch of mineral  they're costing you money and they're not solving the problem.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:09:35):**  So the animals have actually traveled around our farm putting back the mineral exactly  what was missing and people say well animals can't do that they're not that damn smart.  Yes they are their lives depend on it they depend on knowing what they need and it's  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:09:51):**  kind of neat you can watch the cows go to that mineral feeder they'll stick their nose  down on one meter and they just lick the dust off their nose they'll go by the next box  they won't even take that and then they might get to one they need and they'll take a several  
**[0:10:03-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:10:03):**  licks out of that mineral.  So it's kind of neat to see the the cattle select what they need.  Greg has so many tips and tricks we couldn't resist also sharing his thoughts on running  
**[0:10:14-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:10:14):**  a single herd all year round including 50 bulls.  Let's say you have a grass finishing herd you have a heifer herd you have a cow herd  you have a bull herd if you're moving three to four herds around your farm at the same  
**[0:10:27-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:10:27):**  time and you get into a drought situation you are in real trouble because you're getting  around your grazing rotation too quickly and so the bigger the herd the less herds you  have let's say you go from three down to one well now you're getting around you've built  
**[0:10:45-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:10:45):**  time you need time in your recovery and if you get around too quickly the grasses aren't  grown back and so also by having one large herd you have a bigger horsepower engine.  What I mean by that is you're getting more manure more urine and more animal impact placed  
**[0:11:02-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:11:02):**  on the land and also you know we have basically one herd 365 days of the year and by doing  that people say well yeah but you got the bulls in there well we're trying to mimic  nature and in nature there's nobody taking the white tail deer bucks out of the does  
**[0:11:22-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:11:22):**  and so we've been on this program now for about four to five years and what we're finding  out is the cows are moving back towards spring and our hope and expertise of calling the  animals that don't fit in that program over time you know we may be back to where we have  
**[0:11:39-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:11:39):**  one herd we don't have to take the animals out and it's going to be more focused on what  happens in nature because in nature there's no deer that are fawning in the middle of  the winter that's when the nutrients are the lowest they always fawn or kid or lamb when  
**[0:11:57-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:11:57):**  you have the most nutrients and so that's what we're focused on.  We were fearful of having you know 40 to 50 bulls in with our cows because you think oh  my gosh there's gonna be fights and pushing and shoving and you know fighting over the  
**[0:12:11-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:12:11):**  ones that are in heat we don't see that at all and the reason we don't see that at all  is because those little bull those little baby bull calves are born they're sparring  and pushing each other and playing around from the time they're basically three weeks  
**[0:12:24-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:12:24):**  old until they're six months old and they've already worked all that out and so when it  comes time for breeding season we have zero zero fighting they just don't fight they they  would rather chase the cows around and try and get them bred.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:12:42):**  If you take the bulls out and you separate them from the cow herd and then you let's  say you would dump in 20 to 30 bulls into the cows it's gonna be a wreck I mean they  are gonna fight and fight and fight until they figure out who's the boss man and in  
**[0:12:58-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:12:58):**  the meantime your cows aren't getting bred.  Thank you to our supporters Rebel Kitchen.  Rebel Kitchen chose to become a certified bee corporation so they could stand up and  
**[0:13:16-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:13:16):**  proudly be measured against the highest standards of social and environmental performance, accountability  and transparency.  They're honoured to be part of this movement driving change and playing their part in solving  
**[0:13:28-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:13:28):**  world social and environmental problems.  They believe in a future where companies not only compete to be the best in the world but  also the best for the world.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:13:46):**  Steve Gabriel is an ecologist educator and forest farmer who's lived most of his life  in the Finger Lakes region of New York.  He was at the Oxford Real farming conference earlier this year where Farmer of Armour reporter  
**[0:13:58-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:13:58):**  James Friar caught up with him about his ideas on silver pasture.  Steve has some great tips on integrating trees, grasses and animals in a single system.  The way I define silver pasture is when someone is intentionally combining trees and livestock  
**[0:14:16-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:14:16):**  and forages and they're actively cultivating all those components and then they're orchestrating  the relationship between those things so they're putting the right animal in the right place  at the right time, they're making sure that they're moving their animals so that there's  
**[0:14:29-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:14:29):**  not damage being done to the forage of the trees and they're looking to maximise the  productivity of site and so certain sites might be better in the spring versus the summer,  you know different seasonality really comes into play.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:14:41):**  We're kind of managing that complexity in a grazing system.  In America silver pasture is incredibly uncommon.  What's most common is what we call their woodland pasture which is farmers using the pasture  
**[0:14:54-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:14:54):**  as sort of a dumping ground for animals when it's hot or cold or they don't have a place  for them.  The actual practice of silver pasture in the US is lagging.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:15:04):**  The interest in grass fed production and pasture based management is rapidly increasing and  so we're trying to kind of jump on the coattails of that but there's a handful of good examples.  It's a really kind of new concept for farms in the US which have traditionally been very  
**[0:15:22-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:15:22):**  much cleared land, tillage based farms and then livestock has really gone the way of  confinement so we have a bit of a hill to climb.  I think the forest is a place that people feel a sense of comfort and a sense of respite  
**[0:15:35-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:15:35):**  and those qualities I think are important on a farm too.  I've just been fascinated at how I was taught the forest was a place to visit but not really  a place where you gained any sustenance like food or medicine and then as I dug in it's  
**[0:15:48-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:15:48):**  like the most incredible place to gain those things.  For me it was first tapping trees and having sap and making maple syrup which is a really  traditional process where I'm from.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:00):**  If I work with kids it's still the best way to get them excited is to be like oh you know  sugar comes from a tree.  And then from there I got into actually woodland mushroom cultivation.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:10):**  Pistil pasture came a lot later when we started grazing on our farm and I just was interested  in planting trees and I was like how can we make a farm that at some point we'll walk  off of it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:19):**  We should be able to walk off our farms and there's a forest behind us and I think that  that's the vision I have for our land and I think other people are really curious about  that and attracted to the idea but we're just not trained to think that way so it takes  
**[0:16:32-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:32):**  a bit of a mind shift.  Plants and agencies historically called the woods sort of a wasteland or haven't put a  lot of value there.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:41):**  I think that's starting to change slowly but what I'm inspired by is the farmers are always  at the cutting edge right like they're most receptive and interested in adaptable and  they say okay if this makes sense and I can justify the time and energy I'll do it.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:16:57):**  And then the officials say you know it's interesting all these people start talking about this  agroforestry thing and then that's how it kind of changes their minds.  We have a lot of work to do too and I think one of the challenges like I mentioned in  
**[0:17:08-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:17:08):**  the US is there's this legacy of sort of trashing the woods with animals.  So a lot of the foresters in the US and agriculture folks are really weary of it.  Through our extension program you know which is a university based program it's actually  
**[0:17:20-0:17:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:17:20):**  really important for us to advocate for silvopasture and sort of support the farms because when  officials see that an institution like that is saying yes there's research for this there's  a good justification that actually really changes things.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:17:32):**  So that's kind of we're working at it from the farmer angle and the institution angle.  I think in getting our silvopasture started we were starting to think about it and then  in 2016 on our farm we had this historic drought we had the driest year supposedly on record  
**[0:17:45-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:17:45):**  or at least one of the driest years and for us that meant that after our first rotation  we got back around there was no pasture it just hadn't regrown and we were sort of out  of food.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:17:55):**  So we kind of looked at the edges of our land that sort of abandoned hedgerows and there's  a few acres here a few acres there that were all kind of abandoned areas and we said you  know there's food there it's green woody plants seem to do just fine in the drought so let's  
**[0:18:09-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:18:09):**  put the animals in there and see what happens and we did a lot of pruning and cutting and  feeding the animals you know from all that material and they were able to do just fine  on that for like 40 days and then we got them back on pasture and at the end of the year  
**[0:18:23-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:18:23):**  then the kind of measure we would think of as maybe the gain the weight gains were really  no different than a normal year and that made us realize you know what we had stumbled on  just as a necessity was actually something we could do more intentionally.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:18:38):**  So we set out to like okay let's manage these hedgerows and areas more let's plant more  trees let's by the time the next drought comes let's be even more prepared and so we're working  on that the challenge is you know figuring out how to get trees established and growing  
**[0:18:51-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:18:51):**  without you know being able to spend ever as much time as you want so we've killed a  lot of trees that's been our biggest challenge is the spacing of the rows or the clusters  the techniques to protect them you know it's really the first three years of a tree's life  
**[0:19:04-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:19:04):**  that it needs the most protection so you know we think about where we are like deer brows  we could have rabbits and voles we have things chewing on so we're trying to minimize those  things we also plant really dense because we know that some trees will just be lost  
**[0:19:18-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:19:18):**  and we realized over time that we needed to actually do our spacing a bit further apart  because the sheep really didn't like narrow rows to graze in they tend to kind of fan  out when they graze and so if you have narrow rows they don't really get to the corners  
**[0:19:31-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:19:31):**  of the paddock so we went from like 30 feet like 10 meters between rows to like 60 60  feet or 20 meters you know like really open it up so that and then eventually we can go  back in and add another row of trees and move the fencing but it's a bit of a process there  
**[0:19:47-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:19:47):**  and I think anyone that's getting into it should just accept that you're gonna probably  kill a bunch of trees and that's okay it's just like part of the process there's obviously  endless potential of what species you could plant I for the book look through the research  
**[0:20:00-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:20:00):**  and really thought about criteria that kind of narrow the list to the best bets to get  started so is there research about their fodder value for animals are they really adaptable  to like a wide range of sites at least maybe there's a lot of subspecies that we could  
**[0:20:13-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:20:13):**  look at if they're easy to propagate because it's expensive to buy all the material so  you know that's an important one fast growing I mean I we got a you know factor in that  if we take land out of production to plant trees then we want to probably put it back  
**[0:20:27-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:20:27):**  into pasture as quickly as possible so I'm just kind of impatient that way can that tree  get a good size by five years to be graced around yeah so that those kind of qualities  in the cool temperate climate anyway led me to see that willow poplar and black locust  
**[0:20:44-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:20:44):**  and mulberry were kind of the four that really floated to the top and offer kind of a nice  balance of fodder that animals can eat really like a lot of like poplar they could eat all  day versus like willow which is high in condensed tannins which is great sort of medicinally  
**[0:21:01-0:21:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:21:01):**  but does limit their intake and then same with the black locust very high in protein  and same with the mulberry very high nutrients but you know all these things together actually  can formulate I think a very good good diet in addition to the grasses we're not eliminating  
**[0:21:13-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:21:13):**  the grasses or anything but it's sort of a supplement at this point and how do you manage  the potential damage from from grazing animals so we really emphasize training our animals  to electric fence for the sheep we really need to use the net fencing for cattle you  
**[0:21:29-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:21:29):**  could if they're well trained you can get a single strand of poly rope tends to be enough  if they respect the fence they don't tend to challenge it and so we can get away with  quite a bit like we don't even electrify our net fencing sometimes if we just like wrap  
**[0:21:40-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:21:40):**  a tree in it that the sheep will stay off they're so afraid of the fence so we can actually  leave the fence off and they won't even they're like okay you know and and part of that's  like giving them enough food so they're content we tend to fence out the trees and just literally  
**[0:21:52-0:22:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:21:52):**  put the edge of the paddock where the row of trees is and then you know eventually we  can incorporate that back into the paddock and then we could plant another row but we  like to use um like google earth a lot it's like a very free program you can do all the  
**[0:22:03-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:22:03):**  measurements and kind of lay things out and think it through there I think the other thing  we realized is within a row we try to stick with one species of tree just because it's  easier to manage consistency and then maybe every other row is like a different species  
**[0:22:15-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:22:15):**  so that we get diversity but if we do a row with like four or five different species within  the row it's it's really hard to manage that so we try to keep it simple to manage but  also diverse at the same time you know I work with small farmers across all sorts of enterprises  
**[0:22:30-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:22:30):**  and the common thing is those that think about their markets they develop a business plan  it's all the boring stuff it's not the reason you get into farming and and they you know  really keep track and budget those are the ones that are profitable and it doesn't matter  
**[0:22:43-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:22:43):**  if you're making milk or cheese or if you're grazing livestock for meat or if you're doing  mushrooms or you know cider there's examples of all those enterprises people doing really  well people not and I think the big factor is that doing the homework and developing  
**[0:22:56-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:22:56):**  and markets seem to be the thing people leave to last it's actually kind of the most important  to start with so with silvopasture we're talking about grass-fed animal products whether that's  meat or milk or fiber and that's the marketing angle that is available to us right now it's  
**[0:23:11-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:23:11):**  growing the demands there people are wanting to learn generally more about their food and  I think with livestock it's been pretty clear from some surveys that once people realize  there's a difference they want animals that aren't pasture I think that's the angle rather  
**[0:23:25-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:23:25):**  than trying to market silvopasture and then in the future maybe we have a tree fed or  a tree based certification or something like that but you know later carbon sequestration  is a tool to perk up the ears of officials and potentially get funding like we're getting  
**[0:23:43-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:23:43):**  some funding on our farm to plant trees because of the carbon benefit I also think that as  awareness continues to increase even in the US because most of the citizens in the US  are really on board with the changing climate I think that understanding and backing climate  
**[0:23:57-0:24:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:23:57):**  smart farming is going to be something that people want to do more and more so I think  if you're on that bandwagon you're going to be your markets are going to be stronger on  a society level the carbon benefits there but on a farm level it's the resilience to  
**[0:24:09-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:24:09):**  the change in climate is what's important in the wettest year ever or in the driest  year ever the trees kind of look the same they have that benefit I think that's the  big selling point for farms it'd be great if we could all just have pasture and trees  
**[0:24:22-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:24:22):**  but animals have to be in there to actually make that system work that's how it's always  been that's how it's always going to be so I think economically it makes sense but again  I think the resiliency the kind of adaptation aspects are really what's going to sell it  
**[0:24:33-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:24:33):**  to a farmer and I guess the other thing is if you know folks want to learn more about  silvopasture about the book it's just www.silvopasturebook.com and we have an online course coming up in  2019 in March starting in March it's like a six week course so if people want to really  
**[0:24:51-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:24:51):**  dive into this and kind of the minute details that's something that's available out there.  Now a heads up. Back in episode 33 we reported on the Scottish Food Coalition's Kitchen Table  Talk campaign. It was a chance for people to share their hopes, dreams and demands for  
**[0:25:18-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:25:18):**  the future of food in Scotland. At the time a public consultation on the so-called Good  Food Nation Bill was imminent or so we thought. Nearly a year later the consultation has finally  begun and you have until the 29th of March to submit your response. If you're in Scotland  
**[0:25:37-0:25:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:25:37):**  please do take a few minutes to respond. It's crucial the government understands there's  a real appetite for brave ambitious change. Some of the consultation questions are a bit  wordy to say the least. So Nourish Scotland has put together a really handy guide. It  
**[0:25:53-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:25:53):**  includes simple explanations of the questions as well as suggested responses which you can  use edit or ignore. You'll find the guide on the Nourish website nourishscotland.org  and again the consultation closes on the 29th of March.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:26:10):**  And finally today we're in Sicily where we join a wine tasting session with Fabrizio  Lanza and Alberto Tasca, well known in Italy for promoting sustainability and indigenous  grapes. We love hearing Fabrizio describe the wines using straightforward language to describe  
**[0:26:28-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:26:28):**  her taste experiences. Alberto goes on to share with us his feelings on the importance  of measurement, the value of knowledge sharing and the need to look beyond flashy storytelling.  We hope to feature more from the world of natural wine as this is another area where  
**[0:26:44-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:26:44):**  the stories of regenerative agriculture are important.  I love this sharpness and still the velvetyness so I understand we are in a completely different  place because this wine kind of picks me, coats my mouth and then kicks me. It's a  
**[0:27:05-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:27:05):**  very interesting experience.  We started to talk about sustainability around 20 years ago, not before and that's crazy  because for a thousand thousand years we didn't care about the planet. We thought that the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:27:17):**  planet was something that was always generous, always give to everybody and how our life  was looking at the almost urban stars, the center of the world so everything was almost  centric. Something changed so okay the words say change, you have to change the approach  
**[0:27:33-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:27:33):**  but where, how and it was really difficult to understand. So the only things that convinced  me to find a way was just to measure our impact.  We try to be always in a lower impact for each wine. Each kind of wine have different  
**[0:27:49-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:27:49):**  kind of approach and the cellar and the vineyard so you have to measure everything. We try  to measure even all the biodiversity so it means people that go around the state try  to see leaves or wild herbs or whatever and even small animals that are under the soil,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:28:08):**  some animals that you can catch only in the night because they come out on the night and  the people that go around you see that and it's so interesting how changing the approach  that you have you see this kind of biodiversity that is growing, growing and growing.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:28:30):**  So this guy, you remember we tasted this passito yesterday with the sweet and that's an actual  passito how it was made by his grandfather and his father without adding nothing. While  this Pellegrino made the same base as he do but at half the fermentation they add alcohol  
**[0:28:54-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:28:54):**  and then they sell these bottles of wine at a much cheaper, they do 1 million so they  sell it at much cheaper but they have a whole world of customers getting used to this idea  of passito which is a sweet, mild kind of a gentle wine. It's the same concept we said  
**[0:29:16-0:29:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:29:16):**  when Niki came about this infantilization of people. As soon as you do something sweet,  mild, cheerful people go for it and you gain the market very easily.  So before the competition factor was I have my knowledge, I will not share with anybody  
**[0:29:33-0:29:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:29:33):**  because I'm only the best. That doesn't make sense. Now we are killing ourselves, we need  to share everything as we know and try to develop our knowledge of it so there is not  any more any say head value on competition if you know something more than me. It's just  
**[0:29:48-0:30:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:29:48):**  we need to run all together and that's really important.  We have an alliance of producers, we meet every time and we meet every month, we share  documents and our needs. So exactly what we need, what kind of problem we have, we have  
**[0:30:04-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:30:04):**  this kind of problem. Then we have a synthetic committee that is now we have head member  inside and they are especially they work in the university and they try to solve our problems  so we give them the problem, they are totally independent from us, they try to give us the  
**[0:30:23-0:30:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:30:23):**  solution, we select the best solution and make the solution something that we like,  we put money in the research to solve the problem but there is not any conflict of interest.  Information is totally open now, we have this independent commission, it's really important  
**[0:30:38-0:30:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:30:38):**  because they used to go all over the world to go and listen to many conveniums that talk  about sustainable materials. So research, research, research and then if my neighbour  has a benchmark that is lower than mine or the result is lower than mine, I ask him how  
**[0:30:59-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:30:59):**  he do it and then I try to copy, try to do the best, the same thing.  Milky, interesting, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not as good as Santorgi that on milky  could build up a whole romance but, e vero, e vero, I agree, I'm also very intrigued by  
**[0:31:22-0:31:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:31:22):**  the balance, these two are extremely balanced, so you have this first and this second, while  these two are a little bit shorter I feel and as if a younger, a younger, less maybe,  I don't know, as if the colours of the island are not exploited entirely and you have less  
**[0:31:46-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:31:46):**  experience in terms of vintages.  Storytelling is beautiful, there are people that know how to communicate in a really well  way and everybody is, I love poetry, I love philosophy and things but it's really important  
**[0:32:00-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:32:00):**  that we are now start to be really conscious of what is going on. It's really important  that we all know what we buy and why we buy it and where it comes from and how it is made  and that's something that is really, need to change in our culture because we don't  
**[0:32:16-0:32:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:32:16):**  have any data to understand really well, we know some story, marketing now is storytelling  for everything but storytelling, what is it? Something that is really, is true, is something  that goes deeply to what is the impact that the product has or something that is really  
**[0:32:33-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:32:33):**  nice and charming and sexy and so that's why we buy it. So probably we need to focus  on it in a really strong and more serious way.  So it's really difficult to be transparent if people don't want to read because to let  
**[0:32:47-0:33:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:32:47):**  people be more knowledge is not just, I mean the certification so you can trust us, we  can put the face and you can trust my face but if you want to know exactly what is going  on you have to read and read for every product that you eat or drink every day, a book like  
**[0:33:04-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:33:04):**  this I think is quite too much but as much as we go deep inside this kind of things,  especially when we acquire something, when we need to buy, when you're in your kitchen,  when you need to buy meat, know where it comes from, how it is made and things, that's something  
**[0:33:24-0:33:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:33:24):**  that can help the planet.  They have a 10 week Cook the Farm programme which runs each year and the school is also  open for general hospitality from spring to autumn each year offering lots of classes,  
**[0:33:51-0:34:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:33:51):**  lunch lessons and accommodation. See our social media for more information on this.  Thank you all for listening and if you like what you hear please do pass the recommendation  on to your farming friends or even your non-farming friends and if you can find a few minutes  
**[0:34:39-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43#t=0:34:39):**  to write us a review on iTunes that really does help us out and allows more people to  find us.  Bye.

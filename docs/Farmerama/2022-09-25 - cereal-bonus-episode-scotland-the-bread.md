## ‘Cereal’ bonus episode: Scotland the Bread  
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Cereal from Farmerama. This is a bonus episode featuring an extended interview  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:25):**  with Scotland the bread miller Connie Hunter. Okay, yeah, so my name is Connie and I work  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:32):**  as a miller manager for Scotland the bread here at Bauhaus. So it's my job to mill all  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:37):**  the flour and try and sell it to as many people as possible. I found out about the role through  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:43):**  the estate manager here and he thought it would be a good fit for me because I was running  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:47):**  the market garden just 100 metres down the track. I thought, well, I don't know anything  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:51):**  about milling. I don't know anything about wheat. How can I do that job? But we had a  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:00:56):**  conversation and it seemed that it was more important that you cared about sustainable  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:00):**  food and that you could be an advocate for the flour and all the milling technical kind  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:04):**  of stuff you can learn if you're a practical person. So that's how I ended up doing it.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:09):**  Great. And can you just tell me a bit about the mill?  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:13):**  This is a Zentrafan mill, which is a German model. And I think it's the only one in the  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:18):**  country. Sorry if there's someone else who's got a Zentrafan mill. Basically, it's really  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:23):**  great technology because it's just one piece of volcanic rock with a hole in the middle.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:29):**  And there's a motor underneath which pumps air up through the hole and the grain falls  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:32):**  down into that hole and kind of gets spun around like a cyclone. So it kind of grinds  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:36):**  itself against the stone, which is good for a lot of reasons. One is there's no moving  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:40):**  parts. There's no stones grinding against each other. Then you've got a risk of sparks  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:45):**  and fires and that kind of stuff. So because of that, it's safer so I can leave it on overnight.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:50):**  It's designed to be on 24 seven. So that's one of the really good things about it. The  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:54):**  other thing is that then it doesn't create that same heat. So it preserves the nutritional  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:01:58):**  value of the flour much better. You know, we sort of nowadays think of flour as a product  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:03):**  that we have in the back of our cupboard. It's been there for months and months. But  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:06):**  actually, in terms of the nutritional qualities, it's better if you can use it as soon as it's  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:11):**  milled. People seem to understand that now about like coffee and grinding freshly ground  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:14):**  coffee beans. We're really trying to get people to think about flour as a fresh product again.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:19):**  So I only mill to order really. I don't ever have a stock sitting here. So try and get  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:26):**  it to the customers as fresh as possible. Our best before date is three months from  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:30):**  the date of milling to really try and push that message home to people. And so just because  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:35):**  the mill is smaller, we just do smaller batches. And because we're doing different varieties,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:38):**  it allows me to chop and change between them depending on what people have ordered. You  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:42):**  know, I don't do a ton of one kind and then have it sitting around for ages.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:46):**  Cool. Okay. And can you tell me a bit about the varieties or the different the different  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:51):**  flours that you produce at the moment? So we have been just doing three different  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:02:56):**  kinds of wheat. They're all heritage Scottish varieties, hunters, rouge de coss and golden  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:01):**  drop. And those first ones that we were milling were grown in East Lothian by Mungo's Wells.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:08):**  And now because we moved here to the Balkaskie estate, we have been last year, we grew those  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:14):**  three same grains again, but also some spring ones and rye and some Swedish ones as well.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:22):**  And so those grains I'm starting to mill now, I've moved over to the rouge de coss  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:27):**  and the hunters from last year's grain. And we're selling rye to some bakeries as  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:32):**  well. So we're yet to decide, I think, what to do about some of the other ones. There  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:38):**  seems to be quite a market for the Oland's. People seem to be talking quite a lot about  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:43):**  that. Among bakers, it seems to be quite popular. But those are at the minute, my day to day  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:47):**  production is just those three varieties of wheat and the rye. But I think in terms of  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:54):**  how different they are, there's not loads of difference. The rouge and the golden drop,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:03:57):**  I think, have got the same genetic heritage. So they're quite similar to each other. And  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:01):**  the hunters is a little bit lighter. But in the end, what we might do is a blend, like  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:06):**  a heritage Scottish blend, just because obviously there's a lot of work that goes into keeping  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:11):**  all the batches separate to preserve the integrity of what you're selling as a separate variety.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:16):**  So if they're not that different from each other, then maybe we might blend them. But  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:21):**  we have worked with a lot of bakers who really love the rouge, for example. So if they want  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:25):**  to keep just doing that, then we'll do that.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:29):**  On that note, actually, what's been the reception from, I guess, both customers here at the  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:37):**  Bow House and then also bakers around about?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:39):**  So the reception has been fantastic. Basically, I'm now sort of struggling to keep up with  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:45):**  the orders. People are really, really keen. We are working with quite a few different  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:51):**  bakeries in Scotland. We're working with E5 Bakery in London. We send a pallet down to  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:54):**  them once every three weeks. We also now supply Green City, the wholesaler in Glasgow, and  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:04:59):**  yet direct to various different bakeries who are closer. But the main problem for us is  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:03):**  that flour is a heavy product, so the shipping is kind of expensive. So we're always trying  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:07):**  to find ways of piggybacking on other deliveries. We're working with a bakery in Comrie called  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:12):**  Wild Hearth, who are using some of our flour, and they are kindly, you know, on their delivery  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:17):**  routes, they might take some flour for us. So just trying to find creative ways to work  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:21):**  together because we've got the same kind of goals and to keep everyone's costs down.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:25):**  We sell online on our online shop to individuals and at the Bow House market as well. So, you  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:32):**  know, bakers who are committed to baking real bread and sourdough bread love it and, you  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:37):**  know, keep coming back for more. Members of the public who we meet on the market, even  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:41):**  if they don't know that much about baking, they can tell that the flavour is really different  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:47):**  and is definitely something that they haven't experienced with other flours before. So yeah,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:52):**  the response has been really brilliant.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:05:54):**  What do you see as the kind of direction of travel or the trajectory? How do you see things  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:00):**  developing over the next few years?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:02):**  So we've got really exciting things happening quite soon because the mill is going to be  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:07):**  upscaled in a way. So we're going to get a bigger hopper and a bigger bin so that I  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:11):**  can do more at once. With the current capacity that it's at, I don't have really the resources  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:17):**  to expand our customers. You know, the deliveries that we're doing, I don't have that much capacity  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:22):**  to increase right now. But once we have a bigger hopper, we're going to go up to 125  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:26):**  kilos, then we'll be able to, you know, there's loads of people who are interested all around  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:32):**  the country. I'll be able to supply them with flour in a way that I haven't been able to  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:37):**  before. And I mean, we're so new that I think it's just going to keep building. People are  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:43):**  going to talk to their friends about it. And so many people, so many individuals actually  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:48):**  who come back, it's because their friend got it for them as a present. And, you know, so  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:52):**  I can really see it that kind of ripple effect. And definitely people seem to be talking more  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:06:56):**  about grain and real bread now. So I think we're well placed to get our message out there  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:02):**  and make an impact now.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:04):**  I'm curious, actually, have you done any work with, say, local schools or kind of that sort  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:08):**  of outreach?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:10):**  We have worked with Bow House on a couple of different events. They work with the Royal  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:15):**  Highland Education Trust to education days. And so we just, yeah, we did have different  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:20):**  groups of kids in showing them how to clean the grain and how the mill works and talking  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:25):**  to them about different ways of milling and, you know, where their flour comes from. But  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:30):**  we also have another project, which is our soil to slice project, where community groups  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:36):**  and schools can grow grain as a sort of trial. And the idea is then they can actually bake  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:43):**  their own bread with it in the end. So, yeah, we're working with a couple of schools on  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:46):**  that project. But really, we'd like to have more funding to be able to do that in a more  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:51):**  concrete way, because there's so many things you could do with that. It's just the time  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-bonus-episode-scotland-the-bread#t=0:07:55):**  and the resources to do it.

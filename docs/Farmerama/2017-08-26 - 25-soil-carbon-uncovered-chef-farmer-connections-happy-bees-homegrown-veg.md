## 25: Soil carbon uncovered, chef-farmer connections, happy bees & homegrown veg  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  My vision for the future is to see fields of flowers.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:09):**  Wherever I drive through agricultural land in the pastures I want to see, you know, meadows,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:14):**  how they used to be just full of flowers, and also in the crops.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  If you're looking at it from a perspective of grazing animals, it's far healthier for livestock  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:22):**  to have a big range of plants to choose from, and it's healthier for our soils.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:26):**  The microbes in the soil respond to diversity in the same way that the animals respond to diversity.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:31):**  And so it's going to be an absolute win-win situation,  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:34):**  and aesthetically pleasing for anyone driving through the countryside.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:43):**  That was Dr Christine Jones painting a diverse and vital vision for the future of farming.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:49):**  You'll be hearing more from her later in the show.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:52):**  Welcome back to Farmerama.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:00:55):**  This month we hear from across the pond how close connections between farmers and cooks  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:00):**  are giving birth to new dishes and revenue streams.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:04):**  We get to the bottom of carbon cycles and learn what it really takes to build humus.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:09):**  Bees buzz happily as they're allowed to express their characteristics in alternative beekeeping methods.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:15):**  And finally, you're invited to get involved in a citizen science project  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:19):**  that celebrates allotments and home-grown veg.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:23):**  We also welcome Katie Revel as our co-host on the show today.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:27):**  She's been helping to produce Farmerama with us for a good few months now,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:31):**  so we're excited to have her on the show.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:33):**  It's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:35):**  Earlier this year, Abbey Glencross caught up with Adam Kay,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:39):**  Head of Culinary Affairs at Blue Hill in New York City.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:42):**  She was in the area visiting its sister restaurant and farm, Stone Barns.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:47):**  Adam tells us how he ended up at Blue Hill.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:51):**  I was cooking at a restaurant down in Tribeca, in Manhattan,  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  and I had been there for a while and told the chef I was interested in moving on.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:01):**  He was very supportive and I told him a bunch of places I was interested in trailing at,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:05):**  and he said, oh, you've got to go and try this new place.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:08):**  This is in 2000.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  You've got to go and try this new place that's just opened up in the West Village.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:12):**  It's called Blue Hill.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:14):**  It's this young chef, Dan Barber, he opened it up with his brother and sister-in-law.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:18):**  You know, Blue Hill had just opened a few months before,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:21):**  so I'd never heard of Blue Hill.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  I called up Dan, I got his name, called him up, asked him if I could come and trail,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:28):**  and the rest is history.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:30):**  I was hired as the meat cook at Blue Hill New York,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:32):**  and then worked my way through the kitchen there,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:34):**  and then helped open Stone Barns, and then have been based up here since then.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:38):**  It is so much more than a restaurant.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:40):**  I think what is so unique about what we do here is sort of this,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:45):**  obviously is the collaboration between us and the farms,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  both Stone Barns, but Blue Hill Farm up in Massachusetts,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:51):**  the namesake of the restaurant, and so many other farms that we work with,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:54):**  a sort of sense of adventure and experimentation.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:57):**  Yeah, we're just up for anything,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:02:59):**  and there's sort of nothing beyond the pale for us in terms of ingredients.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:04):**  And, you know, when we find a farmer or a breeder or whoever it is that we're working with  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:09):**  who sort of wants to go down the road with us,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:12):**  like that to us is just so exciting.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:14):**  And then for us to be able to have the freedom through not having a menu here,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:19):**  and sort of the style of service that we do to be able to sort of tell those stories.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:25):**  You know, we really ask a lot of our cooks, and we ask them, you know, they do farm chores,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:29):**  they sit in on long meetings with farmers,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:32):**  they sit in with long meetings with seed breeders,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:35):**  we give them readings to do, I guess most restaurants don't expect that of a cook.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  And I think we're sort of known for that now,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:44):**  so we're attracting great young people who are into that.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:48):**  And there are a lot of restaurants around the world that I think are showing this,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:52):**  that this idea of what a cook is is a lot more than the vocation of simply cooking food  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:03:58):**  and feeding people that cooks as thinkers and cooks as activists.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:03):**  And you're getting a lot more than just a culinary education,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:06):**  or it's a redefining what a culinary education is.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:09):**  And it's also just walking out in the field and seeing things which are just like mind-blowingly beautiful.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:14):**  I don't know the name of it, I forget because there's a lot of varieties.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:17):**  You look out here at the window, there's the rose of lettuce.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:21):**  There's a, I think it's the second row, and it's a red leaf lettuce.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:25):**  It looks like a starfish, sea anemone.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  It's the most beautiful, you look at it and it's like,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:33):**  and I grow lettuce in my home, and it's very nice lettuce,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  but this is like, I mean you just realize what great farming is.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:42):**  And it is truly one of the most stunning things I've ever seen.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:46):**  And this is coming out of nature. It is so beautiful.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:50):**  And I've been working here since the day we opened Stone Barns,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:53):**  and I still walk into the field, and they just keep on upping the ante.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:04:57):**  You may remember back in episode 21, we chatted to Root to Fruit chef, Tom Hunt,  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:03):**  about his clover dish for the Blue Hill Wasted pop-up in London.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:08):**  Well, Adam was there as well.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:11):**  He told us about some of the rather exciting learnings from that short stint,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:16):**  probing how farmers and chefs can work together to reap more from the farm here in the UK.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:22):**  The genesis of these ideas really have been a part of Blue Hill's cooking for a while now.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:29):**  In a lot of ways, it's kind of very much a part of like, you could sort of say,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:34):**  like an extension of Dan's theories that he writes about in the third plate.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:39):**  And they're things we'd sort of be messing around with and exploring,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:42):**  especially here on the farm, and looking at the farm as sort of a more,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:46):**  in a more holistic kind of a way, and seeing, you know, what are we not tapping into  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:50):**  that we could be in terms of finding interesting stuff to work with in the menu  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:54):**  in terms of creating additional revenue for the farm, etc., etc.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:05:57):**  So it's like being this thing that we just keep building on.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:00):**  And I think London was a great opportunity to sort of take what we'd learned  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:04):**  and bring it to a new context with new suppliers.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:08):**  I mean, that was the big challenge in London, you know.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:11):**  In New York, we had 15 years' worth of relationships that we could fall back on.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  We didn't have that in London.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:17):**  It wasn't even reinventing the wheel. We had to invent the wheel.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:19):**  We could have very easily just wholesale bought over the wasted New York menu,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:23):**  and probably would have done quite well.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:25):**  But we wanted to do something that spoke to the British food scene,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:30):**  that spoke to the British agricultural scene.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  And then we certainly learned things.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  I mean, you know, certain agricultural things that we don't,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:37):**  certainly not here in Hudson Valley,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:39):**  things that we wouldn't get access to that we got access to there  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:42):**  that has certainly piqued our interest that we would probably want to try and seek out here.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:46):**  I was thinking of a guy, he's a rapeseed oil producer,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:50):**  and we were working with his, with the rape greens,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:54):**  which we'd never worked with before.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:06:56):**  So I don't know how many hundreds and thousands of acres of rape is planted in the UK.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:02):**  It's pretty huge.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:04):**  You can actually get two harvests out of that plant.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:08):**  You can get two revenue streams out of that.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  You can get the seeds for the oil,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:12):**  but you can actually do a first cutting of the plant.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:15):**  It's a mustard. It looks like broccoli rot.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  You know, it's unbelievably delicious.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  I remember this guy, look at his name, what's his name?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:22):**  Oscar, Oscar Harling from Dutchess Rapeseed Oil.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:27):**  This guy was unbelievable.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:28):**  Firstly, his rapeseed oil was incredible.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:30):**  He was introduced to us by one of our cooks in London who had actually been a star here.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:35):**  I remember Oscar speaking to the staff one day before service,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:39):**  and he was explaining that actually it's beneficial to the plant to do that first harvest  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:43):**  because it actually stimulates root growth and sort of a more vibrant plant.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:48):**  And then you still, if you do it early enough in the spring,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:50):**  you still get a great seed harvest to do your oil pressing.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:55):**  So stuff like that was certainly, that was a great thing that I know we,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:07:59):**  you know, for spring of next year, winter into spring of next year.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:02):**  They grow a lot of rapeseed in Canada.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  Maybe we could find a supplier closer.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:07):**  Anyway, that was a cool thing.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  Ben McKinnon at E5.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:10):**  I felt like from the minute I met Ben, like we were like E5 and Blue Hill,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:15):**  or, you know, brothers from another mother kind of a thing,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:17):**  like very much kindred spirits and the stuff that they came up with,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:21):**  they really just sort of took the ball and ran with it in a very inspiring way.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  And they seem to be really inspired by what we did.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:28):**  And I guess they're sort of now have started to incorporate a lot of the things  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:32):**  that they developed for the pop-up into their production in their retail store.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:37):**  Thank you to Adam and thanks to E5 Bakehouse.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:40):**  We're really grateful to be supported by E5.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:43):**  They've just harvested their lisp-run heritage wheat,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:46):**  which was grown over at Duchess Farms in Hertfordshire.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:49):**  So if you've been waiting to try a loaf, then make sure you drop by soon.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:52):**  In the next month or two, after the grain has rested a bit,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:08:55):**  they'll be freshly milling this heritage grain for their Hackney Wild and Wholemeal Loaves.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:00):**  Back at the end of June, we headed to Groundswell Conference  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:03):**  at John Cherry's farm in Hertfordshire.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:05):**  We got to chat internationally renowned and highly respected  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:08):**  ground cover and soils ecologist, Dr Christine Jones.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:12):**  Her years of experience mean that she has a crystal clear understanding  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:16):**  of the way carbon cycles through our soils  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  and the best way to nurture healthy plants and ecosystems.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:22):**  She starts by telling us how she's been working with the soil  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  and how she's been working with the soil.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:27):**  Soil, as we know it, like fertile topsoil,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:30):**  the kind of soil that we want to use to grow crops and vegetables and pastures,  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:34):**  is weathered rock materials like sand, silt and clay.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:38):**  It's going to depend on what the parent material was  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:41):**  as to what the texture of the resulting soil is.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  But that material has to have been in contact with plant roots  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  in order for fertile topsoil to form.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  Plants are the only things that can form topsoil.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:53):**  If you go to the soil, you can see that the topsoil is very, very, very,  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:56):**  very well formed topsoil.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  If you go to somewhere in the world where there are no plants,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:00):**  if it's too hot, too cold, too dry, too high, too whatever,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  go to the top of a mountain where there's no plants growing,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  go out into the desert where there's no plants growing,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  there won't be any soil there.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:09):**  You'll find rocks and you'll find sand and other things like that,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:12):**  but you'll never find fertile topsoil.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:14):**  So we need to think about why are plant roots important?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:18):**  Well, plant roots are important because they're connected to the other half  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:21):**  of the plant, which is the top bit that we see  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:24):**  across fields that's got green leaves and it's photosynthesizing and it's a  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:28):**  conduit for energy it's transferring sunlight energy into the soil through  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:32):**  the plant roots. So we have photosynthesis taking place in the leaves  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:37):**  which is converting light energy into biochemical energy in the form of  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:41):**  sugars and those sugars are dissolved in the sap of the plant so I call that  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  liquid carbon that's how the plant moves that energy around is just as dissolved  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  carbon in the sap. Some of its used to build the plant to make the leaves to  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  make the roots but sometimes you know anything from 20% to 50 or sometimes  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:10:59):**  even 80% in harsh conditions will be exuded from the roots out into the soil  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:04):**  to feed the microbes that actually support the plant. So in harsher  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:09):**  environments we find that there's far more carbon exuded from the roots  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:13):**  because the plant depends more on the microbes under those conditions to keep  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:17):**  it alive and in turn the microbes that are receiving their carbon their energy  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:22):**  from the plant they want to keep the host plant alive as well because if the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:27):**  plant dies then they die because their only source of energy is carbon coming  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  out of the roots of the plant so it's a mutually symbiotic relationship of the  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:35):**  plants and the microbes in the soil working together feeding each other  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:39):**  basically the plants feeding the microbes with it providing energy in the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:43):**  form of carbon compounds and in return the microbes are providing minerals and  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:47):**  trisomates to the plant that it's not able to obtain itself. One thing I  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:51):**  certainly hadn't understood before we talked to Christine was the two methods  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:55):**  of carbon transfer through the soil. Christine explained that both the  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:11:59):**  decomposition pathway and the liquid carbon pathway are important means for  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:04):**  carbon to be transferred through plants and soils but Christine pointed out that  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:08):**  we pay very little attention to the liquid carbon pathway despite the fact  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:12):**  that it's crucial to building soil structure. It's also the only way we can  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:17):**  store carbon in our soils long term by building up humus. So we have two forms  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:22):**  of carbon in the soil one is organic matter which is just decomposing you  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:26):**  know plant materials roots and manures and things like that and the other one  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:30):**  is carbon that's been formed through the liquid carbon pathway which has been  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:34):**  polymerized by microbes in the soil to form this really stable complex  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:39):**  molecules that we call humus and this there's a big difference between humus  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:44):**  and organic matter but unfortunately those two terms tend to be used  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:47):**  interchangeably. So organic carbon or organic matter is as I said a moment ago  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  it's just plant materials or animal manures or something that are  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:12:56):**  decomposing in the soil there's a lot of microbes involved in that decomposition  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:00):**  processes invertebrates as well and earthworms and all of the things that we  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:04):**  tend to just call collectively the soil food web but the end point of that  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:08):**  process is carbon dioxide. Organic matter breaks down to carbon dioxide and then  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  it's not there anymore it's no longer in the soil you can keep on adding it which  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:21):**  is great and you keep feeding the soil food web but all of the processes that  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:25):**  are associated with the decomposition of organic matter happen near the surface  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  of the soil. We need to have organic matter on the surface of the soil but  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:33):**  it's not really doing anything for improving the function of the soil at  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:36):**  depth so we want to increase soil carbon for all of the reasons that you know it  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:42):**  improves the nutritional status of plants that improves soil structure it  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:45):**  improves the way water moves through the soil profile we don't want to have that  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:50):**  just confined to the top couple of inches or the top couple of centimeters  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  of soil we want that you know 30 centimeters down and 60 centimeters down  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:13:58):**  and a meter down so that we really have water penetrating deeply into the soil  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:03):**  profile. So the decomposition pathway the end point of that is carbon dioxide and  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  the end point of the liquid carbon pathway is the formation of humus which  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:12):**  has a high it's a colloid and has a very high cation exchange capacity so it's  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:17):**  great for holding nutrients in the soil and they can all be released for plants  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:21):**  to plants through ion exchange and it's got very high water holding capacity it  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:26):**  improves soil structure and you know basically that that is the substance  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:30):**  that's the Holy Grail for soil and the more humus you have in soil the more  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:34):**  productive the land is going to be and the more profitable it's going to be for  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:37):**  the farmer as well because when you have a lot of humus in the soil and you have  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:42):**  the microbes that form that are also the ones that are important for transporting  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:46):**  trace elements to plants. Plants will be brixing at a higher level they'll have  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:50):**  more sugar in their leaves they'll have more minerals and trace elements in  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:54):**  their leaves they're going to be immune to insect attack and immune to diseases  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:14:58):**  you won't need to use fungicides or insecticides I mean I can understand why  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:02):**  farmers use them when they need to we need to get to a situation where it's  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:06):**  not even an issue anymore there is no insect attack there are no fungal  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:10):**  pathogens really the plants need to be stronger and the great thing about it is  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:15):**  that the humification process is all part and parcel of the same process that  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:21):**  transfers trace elements and minerals into plants because it's that exchange  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:25):**  of carbon when you have sugars coming out of plant roots that's used for  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  making humus you also have the trace elements and the minerals going in the  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:32):**  other direction it's an exchange process. The decomposition pathway is really well  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  known but the liquid carbon pathway is less well known and we need to sort of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:41):**  maybe put a bit more emphasis on that and understand not only how to manage  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:46):**  plants so that they have deep roots but also how to incorporate a lot of  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:51):**  diversity into our crops and pastures so that we have lots of different kinds of  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:54):**  roots in the soil that will support the great diversity of functional groups of  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:15:59):**  microbes all of which work together the more diversity we get in there the more  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:03):**  synergism and the mutualism and it really it's like one and one equals four  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:08):**  when you get when you get a lot of diversity in there and that's important  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:12):**  for the liquid carbon pathway as well.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:16):**  One of the interesting things that the research into cover crops is showing  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:27):**  that and no one's really sure why but when you have more than eight different  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:30):**  species mixed in together and particularly if you have like four  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  functional groups in there it just seems to be like some kind of synergism kicks  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:39):**  in and it starts to restore soil far more quickly than you can do with just a  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:45):**  two-way mix or a three-way mix or something like that. I don't know why  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:49):**  that number is important but I mean anything over eight you know can be eight  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:53):**  ten twelve twenty in terms of our cover crops I don't know what it is about eight  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  that's magical but it just seems to be like there's been English research on  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:03):**  that it's been German research on that and Canadian research on that and that  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:07):**  number keeps coming up and then what they're finding is that if you do have  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:10):**  more than eight in a mix it's better than having 200 kilos per hectare of  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:16):**  nitrogen so where there's been multi-factorial experiments with like  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:21):**  zero one hundred and two hundred kilos per hectare of nitrogen and then one two  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:27):**  four eight and sixteen species in a mix they've found that eight or sixteen  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  species with zero nitrogen is more productive than one or two species with  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:39):**  200 kilos per hectare of nitrogen so diversity definitely replaces fertilizer  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:44):**  and they don't have to even be legumes as long as they're different plant  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  families so you don't want to have eight species of grass for example as long as  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:53):**  you've got diversity you don't need to use fertilizer and then when you stop  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  using fertilizer that's just the magical thing because it's the fertilizer often  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  that causes the issues with the fungi and the insect attacks because if plants  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:05):**  are high in nitrates their tissues aren't strong their cells aren't strong  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:10):**  they haven't got complex carbohydrates and proteins and things in them and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:14):**  they're just absolute heaven as far as insects are concerned so insect attack  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:19):**  of itself is an indicator that the soil is not healthy and the plants aren't  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:22):**  healthy so if we all plant at least eight species in our cover crop or  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:29):**  companion plantings then our soils will build good structure much more quickly  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:34):**  leading to healthier plants and less need for inputs we're big fans of Dr.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  Christine Jones and so we will have more from her next month as she tells us some  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:43):**  of the theory behind building soil structure we'll give you a hint it all  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:48):**  comes down to a whole lot of fungi love  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:52):**  now from soils and plants to the wild world of insects that live in harmony  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:18:57):**  with them Mariana Lanzettl explores an alternative view of beekeeping with  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:02):**  molecular biologist and beekeeping fanatic Johannes Wirtz he's currently  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:07):**  investigating methods that do not use chemical attacks against the Varroa  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:11):**  mite which is proving so devastating to honeybees all over the world but first a  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:17):**  bit of jargon busting we weren't familiar with the intricacies of  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:21):**  beekeeping so we thought you might want some help too a swarm swarming is the  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:26):**  process by which a new honeybee colony is formed when the queen bee leaves the  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:31):**  colony with a large group of worker bees a brood this is basically the little  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:37):**  honeybee larvae foul brood this is a bacterial disease that affects the  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:42):**  little honeybees the brood  
**[0:19:46-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:19:46):**  My name is Johannes Wirtz I am member of the board of Melifera and responsible  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:01):**  for research in our apiary the most fundamental difference is that we try to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:07):**  approach our colonies and hives with respect and I dare say with love beside  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:15):**  of that we have a number of principles that make us quite a strong distinction  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:22):**  with respect to conventional beekeeping the first one is we do colony  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:28):**  reproduction only when the colony wants to swarm second our combs are made  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  naturally that means bees do them themselves and third we design to  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:43):**  artificial queen breeding and now in conventional beekeeping you know you  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:49):**  have colony production without swarming process you do make let's make the combs  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:20:56):**  with foundations and artificial queen breeding is the methods of choice why do  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:05):**  you think that's a good approach why would any anybody keeping bees choose  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:11):**  that method over the conventional beekeeping interestingly enough we have  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:18):**  a number of studies that show that one of the most important ways for bee  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:24):**  health is no brood for a certain period and colony production in the swarming  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:31):**  process means all the unit is that you form have for a longer or shorter time a  
**[0:21:37-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:37):**  brood less period second it is known that sweating wax is another method to  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:46):**  get rid of diseases like American foul brood or European foul brood the third  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:51):**  no artificial queen breeding today we have ample evidence that locally  
**[0:21:59-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  adapted colonies cope better with diseases bring in more honey build fast  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:08):**  combs and have a stronger immune system so I believe with all these methods we  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:16):**  use have been using for decades it is very clear that they are essential for  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  bee health when you as a natural beekeeper approach a hive look into a  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  hive what is it that you see an experience for me the very important  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:35):**  aspect is that I try to grasp the colony as a whole and in this attempt all the  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:43):**  bees be it worker bee be it Queen or be it drone is kind of an organ of the  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:50):**  hive second thing is I would like to fulfill or satisfy the demands of the  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:22:58):**  colony and so in this way I try really to make it possible that they can  
**[0:23:03-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:03):**  express basic behaviors basic activities and swarming conformation and natural  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:11):**  mating of the Queen belongs to these basic facts or basic elements what you  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:17):**  see the future basically in at least some of the beekeepers or a certain  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:22):**  percentage of the beekeepers going into the natural beekeeping direction in a  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:29):**  short term I think no and the reason for this is that beside beekeeping practice  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:36):**  we have also a difficult situation with respect to flower abundance and  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:41):**  diversity and we also have difficulties and problems with respect to pesticides  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:46):**  but for sure somebody who starts to work with being a respectful and I should say  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:23:54):**  responsible way will realize that these two other aspects also belong to be  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:00):**  else and I have to impression in a certain way that these are the trend  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:05):**  beekeepers can become the trendsetter for a healthy environment more flowers  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:10):**  less pesticide in this respect I would say in middle terms they really  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:15):**  contribute to a better health and to a better situation for honeybee and all  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:21):**  the pollinators if you do not want to produce maximal yields of honey this is  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:26):**  the way to go and it is an easy method and it is a simple method and it is an  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  inexpensive method I would like that many people would be able to see this  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:38):**  warming process it's a moment of joy it's an amazing impression this dancing  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:44):**  cloud in the sky there is warmth and beside movement there is a scent and  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:51):**  whenever this swarm comes in a cluster it is the least aggressive condition or  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:24:59):**  in the life of a colony you can touch it you can put your hands through nothing  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:05):**  happens so I don't see where the danger of a swarm could be expect we think that  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:12):**  it must be dangerous so it basically is the birth of a new colony yes exactly  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:18):**  it's a death of the old one the birth of the new one we've seen that chefs are  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:25):**  working closer with farmers well it seems beekeepers are doing the same  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:29):**  we've seen bee boxes on a few farms we visited recently in a way it would make  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:35):**  sense to have bee boxes on all farms that's another form of diversification  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:39):**  part of a multi-layered farm and a very clear business opportunity for a local  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:44):**  entrepreneur  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:48):**  and now for a few words from Rosco Blevins we met him at soil hack he's  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:54):**  spreading the word about the my harvest project if you're growing food to feed  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:25:58):**  yourself your family your neighbors you can get involved Rosco started by  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  telling us about what he grows I've got a back garden which I share with some of  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:08):**  my housemates and we've got a greenhouse there which we mostly fill with salads  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:12):**  and leafy stuff and herbs of a house and also got an allotment around the corner  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:15):**  where we get some of the bigger yields from I work on my harvest project at the  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:19):**  University of Sheffield and I'm very enthusiastic about soil and what people  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:24):**  can grow in their back gardens so my harvest is a citizen science project  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:28):**  which is encouraging members of the public who grow food in their allotments  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:32):**  or back gardens or in a window boxes or in schools to submit data about what  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:37):**  they're harvesting so you can get an idea of how much food is being produced  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:40):**  around the country by individual members of the public the aim is to get an  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:46):**  estimate of how much food is being produced nationally by non-commercial  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:50):**  growers just members of the public like you and me to get an idea of how that  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:54):**  contributes to our national food security and then from that we should be  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:26:57):**  able to work out how much we could be growing if we had more space for  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:01):**  allotments and growing food currently a lot of our estimates about how much food  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  is being produced and how much food is available are just based on large-scale  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:09):**  commercial agriculture and actually there's a huge amount of food is being  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:13):**  produced by members of the public in your back garden in allotments and this isn't  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:16):**  normally taken into account so you saw this project is going to be drawing a  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:20):**  line like to show you how important that contribution is to the health of a  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:25):**  population and how much food is being produced from that historically it's  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:29):**  very common to grow a lot of your own food in your back garden and say in allotments  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:33):**  historically the movement was much bigger and that's sort of waxed and  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:36):**  waned over the last couple of centuries but the last time there's an actual  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:40):**  estimate of food production in the UK was after World War two when there's the  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  Dig for Victory campaign and I estimate that 10% of the country's fruits and  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:49):**  veg came from allotments which was 1% of the land which is pretty impressive but  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:53):**  since then there's been no estimate or no idea of how much people are producing  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:27:58):**  so we're hoping to be the next study to assess that. Any farmers who grow  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:02):**  commercially if you have a veg patch in your back garden if you have a small  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:05):**  plot which you grow food for your house in as well we'd love to hear about that  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:08):**  data and all of this is also linked to linking it to location and looking at  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:12):**  soil type and soil quality so Mike from this be able to get an idea of what grows  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:16):**  best in different places. What we're doing here feels important for everyone  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:20):**  whether you're an allotment holder you grow in your back garden or whether you're a  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:23):**  commercial farmer of arable crops or multicultural livestock whatever it feels  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:26):**  like this is actually it's all part of the same thing of looking into how much  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:30):**  we're producing as a country and how we can be sustained when doing that in the  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:34):**  future and also just generating more attention to it so members of the public  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:38):**  and everyone has more of an idea where their food comes from be it from  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:42):**  themselves or be it from farmers down the road or someone on the other side of  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:46):**  the world is getting people aware of where their food comes from, getting more  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:49):**  attention to that area and why it's so important. We're especially interested in  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:55):**  this project because it highlights an aspect of our food sovereignty that as  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:28:59):**  Roscoe pointed out is often overlooked when it comes to academic research and  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:29:03):**  government policy and until there's more data it's likely to stay that way so  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:29:08):**  it's really exciting that Roscoe and the rest of the My Harvest team are  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:29:12):**  increasing our knowledge of the contribution made by veg patches, window  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:29:16):**  boxes and allotments all over the country. If you have any of those things  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama#t=0:29:21):**  check out My Harvest.

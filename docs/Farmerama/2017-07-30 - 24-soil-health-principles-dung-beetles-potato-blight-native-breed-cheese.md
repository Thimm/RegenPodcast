## 24: Soil Health Principles, dung beetles, potato blight & native breed cheese  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to our two year anniversary edition of Farmer Llama.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:13):**  We're here to bring you stories from farmers and growers around the UK.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:17):**  We want to get stuck into uncovering the nitty gritty of producing.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:21):**  Things like soil experiments, choosing different seed varieties,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:25):**  and exploring sustainable or resilient food systems.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:28):**  Just generally sharing cool and honest projects and ideas going on in food and farming from the UK and beyond.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:35):**  And we'd like you all to be involved.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:38):**  We hope to speak to a lot of you in the coming months  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:41):**  and provide a place where people involved in farming on whatever scale can share stories,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:46):**  hear the latest developments, and come together as a community.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:00:58):**  You may recognize that intro. It was from our first episode all the way back in 2015.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:04):**  We feel those words are as true today as they were then.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:07):**  And want to say thank you for listening, contributing, and making Farmer Llama a great project to be part of.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:15):**  This month we get the lowdown on six simple principles for soil health.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:20):**  We hear from small and smelly friends working away under the ground to support farmers,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:26):**  from potato growers in the Netherlands,  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:29):**  and from a travelling cheesemaker on their research into native dairy breeds.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:36):**  And so on to soils we go, and another report from the soil hack gathering we were at last month.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:43):**  Soil health and tree expert Niels Corfield shared with us the six soil health principles  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:48):**  that can help anyone working on the land at any scale to make soil-friendly management decisions.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:01:55):**  Niels is interested in sustainable living, and this drew him to food production  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:00):**  before taking the next logical step and becoming fascinated by soils,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:05):**  which are of course at the core of all of this.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:12):**  So the soil health principles are a great little tool basically to summarise some of the understanding  
**[0:02:19-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:19):**  or observations that scientists and regenerative farmers have been uncovering over the last few years.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:29):**  And it's kind of a synthesis of some stuff that we already knew about, like no-till for example,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:37):**  but it kind of puts a little bit more meat on the bones as to why no-till for example is so important  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:43):**  and what the significance of it is.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:45):**  But it also fleshes it out and gives some more practical ways for farmers and growers  
**[0:02:53-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:02:53):**  to change the way they manage their land or to make decisions in a way that will improve the soil  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:02):**  or leave the soil in a better way than it was when they started.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:05):**  Some people say there are five, some people say there are six,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:08):**  but the six principles I am working with at the moment are  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:12):**  number one, a living root in the soil whenever possible.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:16):**  Number two, covered soil.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:20):**  Number three, minimum disturbance or no-till.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:26):**  Number four, diversity in plantings or in rotations.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:32):**  Number five, microbes matter.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:36):**  So they have a significant role to play in all of those elements.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:41):**  And number six, eliminate the use of chemicals, which is a bit of a no-brainer basically.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:49):**  So the principles give us an opportunity for organic growers to improve their practices  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:03:55):**  and move beyond tillage-based systems and it gives conventional growers opportunities to move  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:01):**  towards organics but perhaps without taking on some of the baggage that that brings with it.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:06):**  So the principles, ultimately, where their function really lies is as a way to, as a kind of compass,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:18):**  if you like, as a way to sort of set the direction of your operation or your journey, for example,  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:25):**  and ultimately for you to test the different management choices that you make through the year.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:30):**  So ultimately, the more principles that your management decision fulfills,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:39):**  the more likely it will be to be selected or prioritised when it comes to intervening on the land.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:47):**  So one of the systems that, one of the ways that we work with it is to look at existing rotations,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:04:56):**  either horticulture or arable, for example, and then looking at, carrying out a more detailed analysis of that,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:02):**  so you incorporate when you carry out your cultivations, when you carry out your first planting, second plantings,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:09):**  you know, so every single detail that's relevant in that cropping plan is included on some kind of diagram  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:19):**  and then basically step by step, stage by stage, year by year, you critique each of those practices  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:26):**  and look at opportunities to substitute an activity or a management practice for a more beneficial one  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:33):**  or one that fulfills more of the soil health principles.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:38):**  The road to success, I feel, is a combination of easy wins rather than a grand shift in management  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:48):**  and by taking that approach, I think year on year, you'll steadily improve your soil  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:05:54):**  and reduce the issues you have with management and end up getting to where you want to go  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:01):**  but without taking on a lot of the risk that is associated with big shifts or big shake-ups.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:07):**  In a nutshell, the soil health principles work.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:13):**  I feel that there's a lot of chat, you know, from the academic sector and from the extension sector  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:20):**  and a lot of it is fine but actually it seems to me that there's a growing body of evidence  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:29):**  that suggests that the growers, the farmers that have applied the soil health principles the most rigorously  
**[0:06:37-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:37):**  are getting the best results and there's a direct correlation between how doggedly people approach  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:46):**  their different management practices and the results that they get.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:06:51):**  So it's not about being dogmatic, it's about being dogged and unrelenting and you will get there.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:02):**  Neil's is running some courses about creating healthy soils which are based on real working market gardens.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:08):**  Check out his Facebook page called Edible Cities for more.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:17):**  We are very excited to be supported by E5 Bakehouse.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:21):**  E5 Bakehouse is a bakery in East London.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:24):**  They mill their own grain which is sourced locally and they work with farmers  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:29):**  to trial more diverse cereal mixes to use in their bread.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:33):**  We think what they're doing is a big part of the future of farming.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:37):**  So thank you.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:45):**  A few weeks ago a small group of organic farmers from Britain went on a study tour to the Netherlands.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:52):**  Weed control was one of the big topics as well as mechanical weeders and alternative rotations.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:07:58):**  The other big topic was blight in potatoes which is as much a problem in the Netherlands as it is here in the UK.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:06):**  But Dutch growers and breeders are working on new ways forward.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:10):**  Marianne Lanzettel joined the farmers on their trip and reports for Farmerama.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:15):**  Potatoes are grown pretty much everywhere in Holland.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:18):**  They thrive on fertile well-drained soil and the land of the polders is just that.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:24):**  A polder is what the Dutch call the land that has been reclaimed from the sea.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:29):**  It's surrounded by dikes, crisscrossed by canals, it's mostly below sea level and it is flat.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:35):**  Or as one farmer put it, if you stand on a bucket you can see tomorrow.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:41):**  Dawa Monsma is the director of NZ27, a rather prosaic name for a farm,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:47):**  but it stems from the time when the land was reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:08:53):**  Swallows are exploring nesting spaces while we stand next to the potato crates stacked on the side of the barn.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:00):**  Organic farmers are no longer allowed to use copper against potato blight.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:05):**  20, 30 years ago it was used and then they used pretty much copper on the same plot in a year.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:13):**  Then they spray 15 kilograms every time, every week and they do that 12, 30 times.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:21):**  That was 20, 30 years ago, how they used copper as fingers.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:27):**  But now we spray maybe seven times and we use a half kilogram on one hectare.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:37):**  So when you count it all together then you have maybe four or five kilograms total.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:43):**  And then in organic farming you are once in six years on the same plot.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:48):**  So where are we talking about? But we cannot explain that to the customer.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:55):**  Yeah, that's the situation in the Netherlands.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:09:58):**  We also have some problem with the retailers accepting the new blight resistant varieties.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:05):**  That's the same in the Netherlands, but last year it was a big issue in the Netherlands.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:11):**  And the whole growers sector was together and we said we want to stop with copper.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:18):**  But then we need more resistant varieties and we make an appointment about that.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:24):**  But also we want to make a conference with the retailers.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:29):**  Because when the blight is coming early and we don't have death potatoes,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:34):**  then they are buying potatoes from France, from Germany, from all the world around.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:38):**  But in all the other countries that is allowed to use copper.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:42):**  So then we do not have potatoes and the consumer is eating organic potatoes still used with copper.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:50):**  In 2022 then we do not use copper anymore.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:10:57):**  We are still talking about using it as a fertilizer.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:01):**  And then? Then we have enough varieties what is resistant.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:06):**  This is a dream or is it a reality?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:09):**  I think it's a dream. But they are working on it. That's good.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:14):**  And that's the first thing what we have to do.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:17):**  On another farm some 40 kilometers to the northeast, one farmer has been doing just that.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:24):**  Nick Vos and his wife Jozin have been farming not just organically,  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:28):**  but according to biodynamic principles from the start.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:32):**  For a few years now, daughter Lisa-Laura has been in charge of the everyday running of the farm,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:38):**  which leaves her father more time to concentrate on breeding potatoes,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:42):**  which, his wife says, are his other love in life.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:46):**  Nick has never applied copper to his potatoes.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:49):**  To him it was all about careful selection and patience.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:53):**  And seven years ago the Bionica potato was officially recognized as a variety  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:11:59):**  by the EU's Community Plant Variety Office.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:03):**  But it's a potato with white flesh, and that makes it less attractive to consumers  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:08):**  who consider yellow potatoes to be tastier.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:12):**  Last year organic shops did consumer tests, says Lisa-Laura,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:16):**  and in particular younger consumers wanted tasty potatoes that are floury or waxy,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:22):**  depending on what they want to use them for.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:24):**  Only some older customers asked specifically for certain varieties.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:29):**  And her father has already bred another blight-resistant potato,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:33):**  this time with yellow flesh and ideal for making chips.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:38):**  The Sevilla potato will get recognition as a new variety probably as early as next year.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:45):**  And a big producer of chips has already started tests.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:49):**  Sevilla is a hardy variety that does well even under drought conditions.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:54):**  The drought resistance became apparent when Nick asked a Spanish grower near Sevilla  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:12:59):**  to test them.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:00):**  Despite the lack of rain that summer, the yields were excellent.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:04):**  And as the first potatoes to arrive from South America in the 16th century came to Sevilla,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:10):**  Nick decided to name the new variety after the Spanish city.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:14):**  When he started out breeding blight-resistant potatoes 30 years ago,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:19):**  Nick was pretty much on his own.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:21):**  But as the use of copper will not be allowed much longer,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:24):**  interest among growers and processors is increasing.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:28):**  To him, breeding is all about patiently observing plants,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:32):**  being aware of subtle changes, and being in tune with nature.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:36):**  And that is a central aspect of biodynamic agriculture, explains Lisa-Laura.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:42):**  If you look at a plant or an animal, it's a mirror of its surroundings.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:49):**  And the surroundings are different levels, I think.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:52):**  The first level is the soil. That's what we can do as our farm.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:13:56):**  We can put things in, we can try to make the soil the best there is for the plant.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:01):**  But you also got the surroundings, and that like the bees, the pools,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:07):**  the flowers around the acres and stuff like that.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:12):**  And also biodynamic is more up the whole sky, the whole planet.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:17):**  The cosmos.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:18):**  The cosmos, exactly.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:19):**  And the cosmos also has an influence on our lives here.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:23):**  You can see it for an example, the moon gives us the tides.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:27):**  Well, a plant consists for 80% of water.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:32):**  So there must be also a certain, how do you call it?  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:35):**  An ebb and flow.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:37):**  Yeah, there must be something as well.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:39):**  Only maybe very, very subtle, but only to think of things like that.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:44):**  I think that's very important as a biodynamic grower.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:48):**  What's most important is don't think we can do anything  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:52):**  because we are the humans and we know what to do.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:54):**  Because just open for the other things and see what's going on.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:14:58):**  And to look at your crop and to feel it.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:02):**  And don't think you can influence everything.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:05):**  A hundred years ago this was below sea level.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:09):**  This is reclaimed land.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:11):**  Do you think the tide being so important as a cosmic force?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah, maybe we feel it even more here because it was so recently sea.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah, a good one.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:21):**  Didn't thought of that one.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:23):**  But yeah.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:25):**  Earlier this month we headed to the National Organic Combineable Crops event  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:30):**  organised by organic farmers and growers.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:33):**  It was a brilliant day and we created a special podcast about the event  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:37):**  covering relay cropping, companion cropping and seed breeding  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:41):**  plus growing wheat populations.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:43):**  And you can find that special episode on our website  
**[0:15:46-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:46):**  or wherever you normally listen to our podcast.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:15:55):**  A first from Farmer Rama now as we hear from a researcher and farmer in Wales.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:00):**  She tells us about a rather intriguing creature working hard beneath our feet.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:06):**  The dung beetle.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:09):**  I'm Dr Sarah Bainin and I run the bug farm or Dr Bainin's Bug Farm  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:13):**  in St David's in West Wales.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:15):**  And the Bug Farm is my way of running an academic research centre first and foremost  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:20):**  and that research is looking at how we can farm viably  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:23):**  but look after wildlife at the same time.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:26):**  And off the back of the research centre we've got a working farm  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:29):**  so we can put our research into practice on our 100 acre farm  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:32):**  and then we're a visitor attraction.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:34):**  So we have a tropical bug zoo, a museum, a farm trail art gallery,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:39):**  up close sessions where you can meet Dave the giant Madagascan hissing cockroach  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:43):**  and learn all about the fact he's got brains in every single leg as well as his head.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:48):**  What we're doing at the Bug Farm is really a very rounded picture of conservation  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:53):**  through research, innovation and education.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:16:57):**  So in the UK we've got dung beetles that do different things within a dung pad.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:01):**  We've got our tunnellers, so they're the big bodied dung beetles  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:05):**  and they physically shift dung down into the soil.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:08):**  They dig tunnels down up to two metres in depth  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:12):**  and then they dig side branches of those tunnels as well  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:15):**  and they pack them with dung, we call them dung sausages.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:18):**  And by doing that they're pulling free fertiliser down into the ground  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:22):**  then when their eggs hatch into larvae, the larvae will eat the dung around them  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:26):**  and they poo out a liquid fertiliser.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:29):**  So they're processing that dung underground where the plant roots are.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:33):**  So the tunnellers are really, really important,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:35):**  especially in helping water infiltrate into the ground and aerate our soils.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:40):**  We've then got the dwellers and the dwellers live within the dung pad.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:43):**  So dweller dung beetles are smaller and they will, as adults,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:46):**  move within the dung creating tunnels.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:49):**  They'll quite often lay their eggs in the dung as well.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:52):**  Those eggs will hatch into larvae, the larvae then eat the dung in situ  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:55):**  whereas the adults filter feed on the dung.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:17:58):**  And by doing that they physically break up a dung pad  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:00):**  so it's more susceptible to weathering  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:02):**  and more susceptible to earthworms being able to go in.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:05):**  So dung beetles are some of the most important insects in breaking down dung.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:10):**  So if it weren't for dung beetles and other invertebrates,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:12):**  then possibly 4.8% of our permanent pasture area in the UK  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:17):**  could be covered in dung each year.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:19):**  Because dung pats, they just sit there.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:21):**  If nothing breaks them down, they just go rock hard  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:24):**  and they stay there for up to a year.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:26):**  They also, by burying the dung, they reduce the dung pad as a habitat for pest flies  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:30):**  so they can reduce pest fly numbers.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:32):**  They can actually increase livestock internal parasite control.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:35):**  The gastrointestinal nematodes, the worms in livestock's stomachs,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:40):**  they can actually reduce the numbers of those on pasture.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:44):**  They can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock by burying dung.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:48):**  All of these different ecosystem services they deliver,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:51):**  they're all quantifiable services that save us as farmers money.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:55):**  And that's what we wanted to do.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:18:56):**  So we tried to put an economic value on how much money dung beetles  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:00):**  could save the UK cattle industry each year.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:03):**  We only looked at four services that they deliver  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:06):**  and it came up that they can save us £367 million per year.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:11):**  And so we actually looked at if you don't use chemicals  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:15):**  that are toxic to dung beetles during the main grazing season,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:18):**  how much extra money could that save us?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:20):**  And we worked out that if all farmers who are under entry level agri-environment schemes in the UK  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:26):**  took on that practice, it could save the UK cattle industry  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:29):**  another £40 million per year.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:31):**  So it's highly viable to do that.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:34):**  What we now need to look at is from a farmer level, is it worth?  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:38):**  And I think us as farmers, we can make a huge difference  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:42):**  if we take it on ourselves to look after our dung beetles.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:46):**  If this sparked your interest, we have an additional interview with Sarah  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:50):**  on our Soundcloud page where she goes into some more detail  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:53):**  and talks about the overall value of invertebrates  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:19:56):**  and how they are supporting farmers.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:09):**  Daphne Zepos was a pioneer, a legendary figure in the US artisan cheese industry.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:14):**  When she was diagnosed with terminal cancer,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:17):**  she and her husband decided to establish an educational grant in her name.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:21):**  Every year, one American cheese professional receives this award  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:25):**  and they travel to Europe to investigate a particular aspect of cheesemaking.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:29):**  Earlier this year, Sam Frank travelled across Europe  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:33):**  visiting farmers and cheesemakers who have chosen to work with native dairy breeds.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:39):**  Dr Paul Kinstead, in his book American Farmstead Cheese,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:43):**  his statement that really captured me and has stayed with me to this day  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:46):**  is a really high quality cheese shop, they'll have like 40, 50, 100,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:50):**  300 different kinds of cheese and that just scratches the surface.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:54):**  And they're all just milk.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:20:57):**  It's just different versions of fermented milk  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:01):**  that have all been crafted in so many different ways  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:05):**  as a product of their environment, their economic and social conditions,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:10):**  their climactic conditions.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:12):**  It's crazy to see the varieties of cheeses out there  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:16):**  and that they all have their own very specific history and anthropology  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:21):**  and just a very unique story behind each one of them.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:24):**  So for me, it just continues to become more and more interesting  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:27):**  the deeper I get into it.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:28):**  I've been interested in the topic of native breeds for a long time.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:31):**  In the United States, we have not very many,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:34):**  but we do have a few breeds that are unique to North America  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:37):**  and that are recognized as North American breeds  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:39):**  and they were once used for dairying.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:41):**  And today, all of them are critically endangered of extinction  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:45):**  and virtually no farmer would ever try to milk these animals on a commercial level.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:52):**  You can be as idealistic as you want to,  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:54):**  but in the United States and pretty much anywhere,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:21:57):**  you're going to have a hard time convincing farmers to change a system  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:01):**  that they're totally used to if you can't show them  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:04):**  that they will continue making the same, if not more, money.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:08):**  So I was hoping to travel around Europe to learn how they have continued  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:12):**  to preserve their breeds to make cheese to see perhaps  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:15):**  if the American artisan cheese industry could have an impact  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:18):**  on preserving our own native breeds.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:20):**  I started my trip in Madrid.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:23):**  I actually visited a small goat cheese producer right outside of Madrid,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:28):**  so I branched out from the cows a little bit.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:30):**  The numbers of this particular breed have declined quite a bit  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:33):**  and this guy was the only person producing cheese from their milk.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:37):**  Then I spent two weeks on a sheep dairy farm in the Basque country in northern Spain  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:43):**  where they're milking this breed, the Lacha sheep,  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:46):**  which is very traditional in the Basque region.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:49):**  And they've actually done a really great job of conserving this breed there.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:53):**  After that, I went to Sicily for two weeks.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:56):**  I was primarily around Ragusa in the south of Sicily,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:22:59):**  and I was learning mostly about the production of this hard-aged  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:04):**  pasta-falada style cheese called Ragusano and the Modicana cow,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:09):**  which is the only dairy breed native to Sicily.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:13):**  Then after that, I traveled to northern Italy to Reggio Emilia,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:17):**  which is where Parmigiano-Reggiano is originally from,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:20):**  and I was visiting the Vaca Rossa consortium.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:24):**  The Vaca Rossa just means red cow, and this is the old native breed  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:28):**  from that part of Italy that was originally responsible  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:31):**  for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:33):**  And then I went up to Switzerland.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:35):**  There I was mostly focused on the Simmental cow.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:40):**  After Switzerland, I traveled to Ireland.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:43):**  I visited two different dairy farms.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:45):**  Neither of them are cheese makers, but both of them work with  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:47):**  traditional Irish breeds, specifically the Kerry cow and the Dremen cow.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:53):**  My last stop in Ireland was a very small cheese producer  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:23:56):**  with ten Irish-moiled cows, and this guy is the only person  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:00):**  that is both commercially milking them and commercially producing cheese  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:03):**  from their milk.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:05):**  Then after that, I traveled here to Scotland,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:08):**  and my first visit was to a cheese producer in Ayrshire.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:12):**  I wanted to learn about the Ayrshire breed cow.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:15):**  They're not incredibly common, but you can find farms  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:17):**  and a couple of cheese producers that are milking Ayrshire cows  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:20):**  in the United States, so I was kind of curious to learn about  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:22):**  how they've been able to spread throughout the world.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:24):**  I also traveled to the south of England as kind of a last-minute decision.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:29):**  I learned about a cow called the old Gloucester.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:32):**  There's one man in Gloucestershire, England, who is milking Gloucester cows  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:38):**  and making single and double Gloucester cheese exclusively  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:42):**  from the milk of his old Gloucester cows.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:45):**  Then tomorrow, I will be going to my last stop on my journey,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:48):**  which is in Yorkshire, to visit a man that is trying to build  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:52):**  a commercial milking herd of the northern dairy shorthorn breed  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:24:57):**  and revive the old-world recipe for Winsleydale.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:00):**  One of the most memorable quotes, I suppose, actually came very recently  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:04):**  from Trisha, who's the owner of Barways Dairy in Ayrshire.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:08):**  We were specifically talking about Ayrshire cows, but what she said  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:11):**  was spot-on, I think, for any native dairy breed.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:14):**  Her quote, I believe, was,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:16):**  It's really a struggle between the traditional old cow  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:20):**  and the onslaught of the Holstein cow.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:24):**  That is exactly what I've seen throughout this entire trip,  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:27):**  which was very surprising to me because in my original vision for this grant,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:31):**  I was very, very idealistic and I was expecting to travel to Europe  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:35):**  to see these wonderful conservation efforts that have been made  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:39):**  for all of these breeds and that they would be in great, great numbers,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:43):**  increasing a lot of pride in their respective regions  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:48):**  for the people that are continuing to work with these animals.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:51):**  Unfortunately, the reality of what I've seen is that the numbers  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:55):**  for each breed that I visited in each place have declined significantly.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:25:59):**  Some there's maybe a few thousand, some there's maybe only a couple hundred.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:03):**  I was quite surprised to learn that even here in Europe,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:07):**  where there is such a history for cheese production and dairy farming,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:11):**  it appears that the native dairy breeds are all on their way towards extinction,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:16):**  or at least very critically endangered.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:19):**  So there was kind of a consistent theme among all of the farmers that I visited.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:23):**  One was just, you know, it's national pride in a way,  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:27):**  that these are the animals that are of their homeland, of their home country.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:31):**  That's an interesting thing that I don't think you would find so much in the United States.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:34):**  But then they all, no matter where I was, they all claimed that their breed  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:38):**  was far more robust than the Holstein Friesian.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:41):**  They require very little medical attention.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:44):**  They can survive very well and produce very high quality milk  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:48):**  off of the local available forage.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:51):**  They calve very easily, so they don't require much human help,  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:55):**  and they'll live a long life.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:26:57):**  You can have a cow that will calve 14 or 15 times,  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:01):**  so you'll get 15 years of milk production out of them versus 3, 4, or 5 years.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:06):**  And every producer that I visited everywhere I went,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:09):**  they all named these reasons for why they keep these cows.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:12):**  My main takeaway from all of this is that  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:16):**  we are currently in a very critical state of emergency, in my opinion,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:23):**  with native dairy breeds all across the world.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:26):**  And without significant efforts being made to conserve these breeds,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:32):**  they will go extinct.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:34):**  And once they have gone extinct, they are gone forever.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:37):**  Society is kind of generally becoming aware of the problems  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:40):**  with, you know, monoculture and agriculture.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:43):**  So for all of the dairy production in the world  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:46):**  to be coming from this one very specific breed is a problem.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:51):**  But on top of that, when these breeds go extinct,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:54):**  and many of them already have, when they go extinct,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:27:57):**  that's a loss of hundreds of years, if not millennia,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:02):**  of working an animal on your landscape  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:05):**  and making it thrive on your particular landscape.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:09):**  And so it's centuries of agricultural history that are lost.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:13):**  And it's also kind of, you know, your agricultural  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:16):**  and gastronomic history and culture that's totally lost as well.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:21):**  My main goal, I guess, at this point with my presentation  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:25):**  to the American Cheese Society is to really bring about awareness  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:29):**  about this issue because, you know, it's something I've been interested in  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:32):**  for a long time, but in my close to a decade in this industry,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:37):**  there's just, there's very little talk at all about breeds in general.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:42):**  And especially there's really no talk on native breeds  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:46):**  and their current status as all being critically endangered.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:51):**  So if at the very, very least, if I can just make this a topic  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:55):**  that people are talking about and are concerned about,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:28:58):**  then I think I will have, you know, I will have done my job  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:01):**  as a Daphne Zepho's Teaching Award recipient.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:04):**  The whole idea too is that you will continue teaching  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:06):**  whatever you've learned wherever you go throughout your cheese endeavors.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:11):**  Music  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:21):**  This brings us to the end of our 24th episode.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:25):**  Abbey, what are some of your favorite memories from the time?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:30):**  Yeah, well, I feel kind of emotional.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:35):**  Just kind of, I guess, overwhelmed with warmth and thanks.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:40):**  Well, I do always think back to the very first episode  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:43):**  and all the support we got from the Community Supported Agriculture Network  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:47):**  at that event, Ben Raskin's guitar playing.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:52):**  You may have been able to tell that I really enjoyed discussing beauty  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:29:55):**  with Fiona Reynolds, Dame Fiona Reynolds, earlier this year as well.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:01):**  I guess it's just about hearing voices from the void.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:05):**  I really love that as well when someone just sends something in  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:08):**  and this voice appears in our ears and it's a wonderful story,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:15):**  a really human story, and it just always feels full of honesty and integrity  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:20):**  and that's just a great way to share contributions to the future of farming.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:27):**  When we started, this was you and me and Nigel  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:31):**  and we very much thought that we would be doing this on our own  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:34):**  all the way through, but I think we've had well over 100 people contributing  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:40):**  and I would say probably 20 people who are regularly in touch with us  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:46):**  sending stuff in and helping in one way or another.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:52):**  And I guess what's exciting is the reason we're all doing it  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:30:56):**  is because we all recognise the importance of the earth  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:01):**  and producing things from the earth at the same time  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:06):**  and how can we make that work for people, planet and have profitable businesses.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:14):**  If you're listening and you are interested in getting involved  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:17):**  then there's always space for you.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:22):**  We'd love to work with you.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:24):**  What are your favourite moments from the shows?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:27):**  I guess a favourite moment for me would be when we went to the We Feed the Planet event in Italy  
**[0:31:33-0:31:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:33):**  and just saw thousands of young farmers coming together to share knowledge and party.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:43):**  But it was a real coming together of really focused, angry, determined energy  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:50):**  and I got an awful lot from that and it was just very clear that so many people around the world  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:31:54):**  are dealing with and committed to solving so many of the same problems.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:00):**  Totally agree with that.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:02):**  Another great thing for me was going down, we went to the recording on Nigel's farm  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:10):**  and we lay in the wet hay on our backs while Michael  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:19):**  who's one of the two people who's contributed guitar music to Farmarama, thank you to Owen as well  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:26):**  with pregnant cows gently kind of lowing around us and there were calves running around  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:33):**  and the sun was going down.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:36):**  It was a time that I felt that the energy of the farm and the life on the farm was really in sync  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:42):**  with our presence in the world of farming.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:46):**  That sounds over the top and it is over the top.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:50):**  It was a beautiful moment, the guitar playing with the cows and the setting sun, I agree.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:32:57):**  I remember it well too.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:00):**  And I guess I also just love all the smaller interactions as well.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:06):**  A big part of Farmarama is meeting people and hearing the exciting things they're doing  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:14):**  or the risks they're taking, the experiments and then being able to share that knowledge and that risk.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:21):**  I think otherwise it can be scary on your own.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:27):**  It's probably going to be scary anyway.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:33):**  This show was created by me, Joe Barrett, with Ari Rose and Katie Revel.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-24#t=0:33:40):**  Thanks so much to Marianne for the additional reporting this week and to our supporters, Efite Bakehouse.

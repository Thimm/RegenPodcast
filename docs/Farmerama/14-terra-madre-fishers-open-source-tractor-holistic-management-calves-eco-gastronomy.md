### Farmerama  (2017-03-10)  
### Author(s): Farmerama  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  The noise you can hear is the Slow Food Tierra Madre Salon de Gusto parade. There are literally  thousands of people marching from all around the world for Slow Foods.  This month we are live from Turin, Italy, where thousands of small-scale farmers, shepherds,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:30):**  fishers, chefs and people committed to more resilient food systems from over 100 different  countries all around the world have come together to celebrate and share food and farming knowledge.  It's really like the UN for food systems. This is Slow Food Salon de Gusto Tierra Madre.  
**[0:00:51-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:00:51):**  Welcome to Farmerama. Welcome to Farmerama.  Nigel, can you explain to listeners what Slow Food Movement is?  The Slow Food Movement was founded by Carlo Petrini back in 1986. It's essentially the  
**[0:01:08-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:08):**  antidote to fast food. He set it up as a way of promoting more local, traditional foods  and a better, healthier, fairer food system.  Yes, and I heard Carlo speak at the opening ceremony, which was in an outrageously lavish  
**[0:01:28-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:28):**  theatre in the middle of town. I initially felt that was a little bit at odds with a  movement which is really about indigenous people and farming people's relationship with  the land. But I sort of left in the end actually feeling quite positive about it. There were  
**[0:01:47-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:01:47):**  a lot of farmers in the room and a lot of farmers speaking, as well as a lot of politicians,  and I guess that you sort of need those two ends of things if you're going to make change.  I really liked what Carlo was focusing on, stressing in front of these political leaders  
**[0:02:02-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  that we live in a world where the economy just really doesn't represent farmers at all.  He spoke very clearly about, as a society, we just simply have the wrong relationship  with food. And I was struck by sort of comparing, he was talking about hunger on one side and  
**[0:02:21-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:21):**  then obesity on the other side, and both using examples of how much they cost us in terms  of our emotional well-being as much as economically. This whole festival, this whole gathering  being a sort of focus for really addressing the fact that our relationship with food and  
**[0:02:41-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  producing and farming is wrong. And he speaks brilliantly and it was really quite inspiring.  But here we are now, we're at the Valentino Park in another part of Turin. Abby, maybe  you could explain a little bit about what your impression is of.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:01):**  So for me, this event is incredibly exciting because of the variety, diversity of people  that get together in one place. I think that kind of thing happens with heads of states  and quote-unquote important people quite often. But here it's actually the producers and the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:22):**  people from the land and the chefs and people actually doing things and making things, coming  together and sharing their ideas from places like Guinea-Bissau to Poland. Like everyone's  here, it's crazy. This all kind of came to a head when we went to the parade where 7,000  
**[0:03:40-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:40):**  farmers, food artisans, fishers, indigenous people, activists, leaders, citizens from  143 countries paraded through the streets of Turin sharing culture, dancing, singing.  And most importantly, we were joined in voices echoing the shared message of saving biodiversity  
**[0:03:56-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:03:56):**  and feeding the world sustainably.  My name is Asia. We are from Russia, North Caucasus, and we came here to Terra Madre.  We want to save our traditional products, our traditional food.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:12):**  People call me Ab, but my name is Abdelaman. I'm from Italy, but I was born in Morocco.  I think about the food, I think about the farmers, the farmers that they work hardly  to give the people good food. So if I tell you about food, I tell you I love the farmers.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:29):**  I love every person that work with the green, with the products, the fishers, every person  that live with the food.  My name is Andrea. I'm a teacher. I know that we need to change the words and how are we eating the food.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:04:51):**  My name is Tiamah. I'm Burkina Faso. The diversity of agriculture in Africa is a time  for finding solutions for the natural system.  My name is Caroline. I'm from Denmark.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:14):**  What's your reason to be here today?  I'm going to be helping the earth.  Yes, more or less. I study. I'm a student. I study economics.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:25):**  My name is Shohei from Japan. After Terra Madre, we have to change the Japanese style by the slow food.  There will be a lot more from Chuen later in the show, but we're also going to be sharing  some stories from other places we've been in the last few weeks.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:05:53):**  Last week I was at GO-DAN, Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition Conference in New York.  A meeting of heads of state, data experts from around the world and completely different  to the sort of vibe here.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:09):**  But I'd like to share a story and it's a product really from someone I met there.  It's a technology to empower the small scale farmer and the business model is one really focused  on the needs of the farmer, not big business. The machine's open source and it's really simply designed  
**[0:06:27-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:27):**  so farmers can fix it locally by themselves.  Hi, I'm Lockie Catron with the company Kleber. We're manufacturing the Ogun tractor and we're based  out of Paint Rock Valley, Alabama. The goal of the Ogun tractor is to enable the rebirth of the small  
**[0:06:45-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:06:45):**  family farm, both in the United States but also all around the world. 80% of the world's farmers are  small and so we have to serve those farmers first in order to feed the world.  The Ogun tractor is a small scale 19 horsepower tractor that is made using common components so that  
**[0:07:03-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:03):**  farmers can fix it in the field, fix it in the shop and find parts locally.  So this tractor is ideal for small farmers that have anywhere under 80 acres.  One of our founders is from Cuba and one is from Alabama. So the one from Alabama grew up farming  
**[0:07:19-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  with mules so he understands what it's like to not have any sort of mechanization on the farm.  And then the other one's from Cuba, Saul Berenthal, and he always wanted to go back and do business  in his country and do something that actually benefited the people of his country.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:33):**  So we started designing this tractor at the end of 2014 when the President of the United States in  Cuba announced that they would begin to mend the relationship between the two countries.  And so we first designed the tractor for Cuba and they loved our business model which is an open  
**[0:07:49-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  system manufacturing approach. We're the first U.S. company approved to manufacture in Cuba.  Well right now the equipment industry has totally ignored the small farmer and they don't have any  equipment out there for the small farmer and especially not at an affordable price.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:04):**  And that's largely because of their business model. They lock the farmer in so they have to go back to  them for parts, they have to go back to them for service. So our whole business model is giving freedom  back to the farmer, letting them be independent. We will publish the designs for our tractor and for  
**[0:08:19-0:08:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:19):**  everything that we end up producing so they can buy them from our manufacturer, they can use implements  from other companies or they can build their own if that's cheaper or if they have a better and new idea  for an implement. Farmers are innovative people, farmers are capable people and many of them want to  
**[0:08:34-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:34):**  fix their own equipment but they just can't because it's built so complicated. So by providing a simple  tractor anyone can learn how to fix it and many of them already know how to do that.  But what they can also do with the architecture that we have is go and take it to someone that they know  
**[0:08:51-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:08:51):**  that can do it so they don't have to go back to a dealership from our company. We don't even have  dealerships but they can take it to a local shop. So it's all about building up the local economy as well.  Farmers in the developed world are extremely excited about this because they are so tired of not being  
**[0:09:08-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:08):**  able to fix their own equipment. They just want the freedom to be able to do that and they realize that no  one is serving them, no one is serving that market of farmers. So that's what we want to do. And for the  developing world they're just excited to have any sort of mechanization. If you're using an oxen to plow  
**[0:09:25-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  your field a tractor looks a whole lot better. Thank you, Locky. Sound good, Nigel? Yeah, I like the look of it, Joe.  I think certainly for small scale arable and horticultural farmers I think this tractor offers a lot of  opportunities. And I love the fact that it's open source and the fact that you can fix it very cheaply and  
**[0:09:46-0:10:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:09:46):**  it's not an expensive bit of kit. It's pretty amazing stuff.  So Terra Madre is a sort of conference, it's a meeting of farmers, it's a meeting of academics and thinkers.  But there's another side to what's going on here this weekend and that is Salone del Gusto. We're actually sat  
**[0:10:20-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:20):**  maybe 100 meters from where this is going on. I think there's around 1200 exhibitors from all around the  world bringing their local traditional foods, credible produce, cuisine from all around the world and from  over 100 countries and it's incredible to be able to walk around, talk to the people who produce that food,  
**[0:10:42-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:10:42):**  taste the food and really get a feel for what they're doing. I mean the really interesting thing this time  they're doing it is that the Salone del Gusto is spread out throughout the whole city. So in the past it was  all in one massive hall, which is great, but I think it's quite nice to spread it out amongst the city and really  
**[0:11:03-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:03):**  bring it alive and bring the sort of culture of the city to life.  One of the talks that I've attended was about something called Eco-Gastronomy, which is a project which comes out  of the Slow Food University which is in Bra, which is where we've been staying actually and it's about 30 minutes  
**[0:11:19-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:19):**  outside of Tewin. Essentially David is talking about how we need to think about, he's talking about a way to think  about food in terms of our whole body. So not just what it tastes like, not just its nutritional value, but the smell,  how it makes us feel, where it fits into the economy and the whole web of production from the farmer who grows the food  
**[0:11:42-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  to the recipes we remember from our grandmother, to sort of, I don't know, thinking about the value of food  in a broader way. And of course attention on food in this way has to be important to the farmer.  I'm David Santo and I am what we're calling a professor at large for the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:04):**  And my project is to move around to different places, co-organize events with different local partners and events that  focus on different issues in different formats that make sense for that place. So it could be anything from a roundtable  discussion to a meal to a storytelling event to a workshop, depending on what those people I work with think should happen.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:25):**  I think one of the things about food is that the sensory properties of it are always present. They're not invisible and they're not  unsmellable, they're not untasteable, we just don't taste them or smell them or touch them. We have deactivated our senses  in day-to-day life to a large extent and that comes from a whole tradition of Western thinking and philosophy and the belief  
**[0:12:46-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:12:46):**  in higher and lower senses and the belief in the mind-body separation, the belief in even the division between self and other.  So this is one of the reasons that the word eco and eco-ecological are very important to me because they remind us to  pay attention to the whole system that is participating in what we sense as the reality of food.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:07):**  Ecology and performance to me are my sort of touchstones and my anchor points for everything that's gastronomy because they remind  us that it's the whole thing that produces the effect, just as the whole ecology produces an effect in a sort of natural environment.  The whole ecology of food, including language, meaning, significance, symbolism, including materiality, substance,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:29):**  physicality, including the processes of transformation and harvesting and cooking and growing and even what happens in a seed  is a performance. And we talk about in fact the way seeds perform or materials perform. There's a lot of engineering science that  talks about the performance of food, but we don't think about it as a very holistic performance. And that's what's super important  
**[0:13:49-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:13:49):**  about doing anything with food is recognizing we're not the center, we're not the only agents, and a lot of other stuff are  performing, a lot of other things are performing while we think it's us that's in control.  I actually think farmers already know all this stuff. Farmers and cooks, but even more farmers are more present to the  
**[0:14:15-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  performance of the entire environment in producing what happens with them. They see and feel and sense climate, soil,  microorganisms, vectors of transmission of disease and pollen and all the other things that make food happen. They witness  this in their day to day and they know that they're a participant in that, they're part of the environment, they're part of the  
**[0:14:36-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:36):**  ecology, but they're not the only thing. So if you're asking, if you're talking to a farmer and he or she says, well, this happened  today on the farm, they already know that all those stories are taking place and interweaving to create the ecology.  I always feel like I have nothing to share with someone who has a really close physical contact with food on a day to day basis  
**[0:14:59-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  because they already know this stuff. I think one of the most important things with this project is not talking to people about  their food, but listening to people about their food. The story is a way for the individual to activate his or her own power,  understanding, knowledge of themselves. When you tell a story, you learn about yourself much more than you learn about  
**[0:15:17-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:15:17):**  something else. And it's a great way to turn the spotlight back on people who already are experts in their world of food.  If you listen to someone, an extraordinary thing happens. I'm slowly learning to get better at not talking. When I listen,  much more happens than I do. If more people do more stuff with food, we're going to get to be a better global community.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:04):**  Earlier this summer, we went along to an intro to Holistic Management at Crune Park. Holistic Management International is an  organization that educates people in regenerative agriculture for healthy land and thriving communities originating from the  ideas of Alan Savery. It provides a framework that allows farmers to make positive decisions that strengthen their business,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:26):**  the environment, and their home lives. Land manager Rob Havard tends around 100 acres of the National Trust parkland,  moving his 40 cattle across the landscape based on holistic planned grazing techniques. He tells us how Holistic Management  has affected his life. My name is Rob Havard from Havard and Co-Organic Farms. We farm in Worcestershire, 50 acres owned farm at home.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:16:51):**  We rent another 230 acres off the National Trust. I think the main thing for me is the setting of proper goals that take into account,  not just the business side, the economic side, but also the environmental side and the social side. Whether that's family or whatever.  It's allowed me to set a goal I can work towards that I can feel good about. I know the decisions I make within that framework,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:17):**  I'm going to be working towards that. All the time I'm testing to make sure I'm moving towards where I want to be on all those  different parameters. It's had a big impact for me. It's taught me to make decisions to cut time out and to say no and to really  compare what the best option is rather than trying to do all options at once. A couple of things would be, one of them would be  
**[0:17:42-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:17:42):**  selling the sheep last year. So we swapped them out for store cattle. So just doing the marginal reaction tests within the  management framework wasn't something I was expecting to do, wasn't really something that I wanted to do, but I could see it was  financially better, it was better for my time, more time with the family and it was going to move me closer to my goals.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:02):**  It was a more flexible system for us in terms of the rented farms that we have, integrated better with those as well.  So on three fronts it was working better for the business and so we ended up making a decision that worked on all three fronts that  we wouldn't have made if I hadn't done the test. My goal really is to have a multi-generational farming business that really  
**[0:18:26-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  looks after the environment but it also heals our bank account as much as anything else. When you're getting up in the winter  and you're moving stock twice a day in sideways rain you need motivation. I think about my three kids and they're all pretty keen  to take on the business and so every day I get up, that's my motivation to go and move towards that goal of making sure they've got  
**[0:18:49-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:18:49):**  at least an option to go into the business if they want to. Well they're eight, six and four so they're quite young but they just  love getting involved and they're into everything and I just want to, I was very fortunate to have grown up on a farm and have that  upbringing and I just want to make sure that they've got the option to experience that but also to provide that for their kids.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:10):**  Long time Welsh dairy farmer Will Edwards and his son were also there to learn and share ideas with other livestock farmers.  One idea they were particularly excited to share was the simple triple suckling method as a smart way to feed and care for new calves.  Hi I'm Will Edwards and we're pasture farmers and we farm dairy cattle and we've started a new herd on the home farm  
**[0:19:39-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:19:39):**  this year. Because we were starting from fresh we didn't have any calf feeding equipment so instead of going out and buying it  because of dairy austerity we thought we'd try and save some money so I've got a friend that's been multiple suckling his calves  on nurse cows. I always noticed that he ended up with really good heifers and really good stock. Mostly I just put a heifer in with  
**[0:20:06-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:06):**  three calves and they would either take to each other straight away or not really and it did help that I would tie my farm dog up  just outside the pen. That seems to sort of conjure up miraculous mothering abilities in heifers. They bonded and after a few days  and everything was settled I would formally tag the calves, disbud them and take them right away from the grazing platform  
**[0:20:36-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:20:36):**  so that neither the calves or the cows were competing with my growing milking herd for resources because grass is very short in the spring  until you get to magic day when you're suddenly instead of looking for grass it's just everywhere. One of the features that we found  was because we were taking pressure off the milking platform it meant that we could make some savings in terms of not feeding concentrate  
**[0:21:06-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  compared to some other similar farms. We did seem to always have a surplus, well I wouldn't say a surplus but a plenty of grass in front of us  and we were able to cut out the concentrate a lot earlier so just feed a minimal amount. So it's the first year I've done it and I'm really pleased  because of the downturn in the payout this year. Whereas we'd budgeted on having a herdsman I decided to do it myself but we still got the other herd  
**[0:21:41-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  to manage as well so I've got to try and keep things very simple. At the same time my neighbour who works on a chicken farm in the morning  he was looking for some work in the afternoon so he was able to come and help me in the afternoon but on a conventional system  the calves would be screaming with hunger by then but if I can suckle the calves on cows then everybody's happy.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:09):**  There was one day when we actually forgot about the calves, nobody went to see them or feed them or anything and nothing happened  because they just carried on suckling their foster mothers and the cows didn't manage, didn't mind either because basically feeding calves  means just taking a small bag of meal over and feeding it out in some portable troughs for the cows so that they come to you  
**[0:22:36-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  and it just means that when you do want to handle them they're used to following the bit of a rattle of a cake bucket  and that's the only reason they could survive without concentrate but it's just nice to have that close contact with them  so that when you have got to handle them everybody's a bit calmer.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:22:53):**  The 21st to the 23rd November there'll be another introduction to holistic management with a specific focus on financial and grazing planning  in Worcestershire again. We'll post a link to it on our Facebook for anyone who's interested.  Part of the Slow Food movement is slow fish and a key player in this dialogue is Paul Molyneux, long time fisherman turned journalist.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:15):**  He shared how he's helping to empower fishing communities by giving the young people the tools to share the stories of their families and communities.  This idea lit up the eyes of fishers from all nations.  I was a commercial fisherman for 25 years and I would read what was in the newspapers that people wrote about us  
**[0:23:34-0:24:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:23:34):**  and I said man I've got to tell my story. I was at Slow Fish yesterday and we were talking about what was the most important takeaway from the day's discussions  and one of the things that came up repeatedly was storytelling, connecting, that we get our story out there to people.  I was fortunate enough to travel around the world looking at fisheries and I was on the beach in India and the people went down there  
**[0:24:08-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:08):**  and they bought fish from the fishermen. Well they didn't need a certification because they knew the story of their food.  They knew the man and I saw this in Thorpstrand, Denmark. The boats would come ashore and the people would come with their little plastic bags  down to the side of the boat, hand up money, get bags of fish and they knew the guy. They knew the story of their fish.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:29):**  What certification is, is kind of a corporate tool for, you know, it's a globalization tool in a way,  but sometimes fish do have to be exported globally. They've been exported globally for hundreds if not thousands of years.  Dried fish has gone all over the world from places where there's lots to places where there's a little.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:24:56):**  So what the storytelling is a more personal, a personal certification I would say.  The thing about that label and those monitoring systems and all that stuff that costs money is it all has to be paid for ultimately with fish,  more fish going into whose pockets, not the fish, you know, fisherman's, right?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:18):**  The Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries, we have a program called the Eastern Maine Skippers Program  and it's an education program for the children of fishermen, kids who are sometimes reluctant to engage in the academic  aspects of life because their lives already have meaning on the water.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:38):**  They would rather go fishing and they make sometimes a lot of money at it.  What we're doing is reaching out to them and saying, look, as fishermen in the 21st century,  you're going to have to be conversant with a lot of skills in order to deal with the management,  
**[0:25:55-0:26:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:25:55):**  in order to deal with competitive industries that also want to invade your, you know, that want to take your ocean.  We get them together at a cohort day.  I showed the students photographs of fishing, which automatically gets their attention.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:12):**  And I asked them to just say one thing that they saw in the photo.  Each time that what they noticed got deeper and deeper and they had all of a sudden this group of words.  We talked about what was going on and then I did for them a quick workshop on how to mind map,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:32):**  how to organize information and then I asked them to write a caption for the photo, which they all wrote.  And their teachers were astounded that these kids had actually written something, that I'd actually tricked them into writing something.  They loved it because they were talking about something that was important to them.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:26:51):**  So now we're amping that up and we're bringing in radio journalists such as yourselves, videographers, TV journalists,  reporters to teach media skills to these kids so that these kids can tell their story.  And so basically we're equipping these kids to tell their story so that it doesn't get spun or reinterpreted by an NGO  
**[0:27:14-0:27:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:14):**  that maybe has another agenda or somebody who wants their their their sea bot, you know, their fishing areas for some other other project  and can spin their story. They're going to be equipped to tell their own story and really reach people.  Thank you everybody for joining us in Chuin. This is a first for us.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:27:41):**  We've essentially recorded this episode as live on the day.  We're going to close with a quote from Carla Petrini, which I think sums up everything that's been going on here.  And we'll see you next month.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/14-farmerama#t=0:28:00):**  They are giants.  But we are millions.

## Shorts: Rob Havard on herbal leys  
**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:00):**  My name's Rob Havard, I farm about 420 acres in the Worcestershire countryside, 44 acres  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:15):**  owned and we rent the rest off to two main landowners.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:20):**  Basically we have very species rich meadows and grasslands that we farm to produce organic  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:28):**  beef and also have a pedigree angus herd producing cattle that fit to these grass fed systems  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:34):**  so we're providing value to other farmers, providing them with the stock they need to  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:39):**  thrive in these systems.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:41):**  Because of winter grazing you end up with some areas that are going to have a little  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:44):**  bit of pasture damage around movable water troughs or also sometimes if a really bad  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:51):**  storm they'll all group together and they will move around like penguins and tread the  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:55):**  ground up.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:00:56):**  So that opportunity has created a risk as potentially a weed germination site but that  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:01):**  turns into an opportunity to throw some wildflower seed on, it's what I call the love bomb and  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:06):**  then it all comes out, beautiful wildflowers, sorts out the soil structure, lots of deep  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:09):**  rooting herbs and grasses and it's all good, it's all good and that starts spreading around  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:15):**  the pasture and it's all good.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:17):**  A couple of things in terms of harvesting the wildflower seed from other sites or sites  
**[0:01:21-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:21):**  on your own farm is going and collecting the grass seed and the wildflower seed just before  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:28):**  it's all dropped to the floor and just at the right time and you can go in and cut and  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:32):**  collect it or you could take wet hay as in just cut it and take it and go and spread  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:37):**  that on a field, on an arable field you wanted to seed down but maybe you'd already broadcast  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:42):**  some cheap native grass seed on and that will give you a herbal lay much cheaper than going  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:49):**  and buying the seed somewhere else so you can have all that resource on your farm, use  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:54):**  your arable margins to do that.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:01:57):**  I've even seen someone at one of the top seed companies now, they started out using a huge  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:03):**  grain bucket on the front of the tractor going into a wildflower meadow, putting it at the  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:08):**  right height, driving like hell in the night with the grain bucket on and it was just collecting  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:13):**  all the seed in there and that's how they started out.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:15):**  It can be sort of rough, quick and dirty and as long as it works who cares.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:23):**  We had a 20 acre field that was all ryegrass and clover, just two species, competitive  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:30):**  ryegrass lay and whilst it's productive it doesn't hold the cattle up very well, the  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:35):**  root structure is quite poor and I wanted to terminate that and to use that field as  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:41):**  a bit of a trial so we went in and grazed that last in the wettest time of the year  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:46):**  in terms of our winter rotation and I usually have a back fence so I limit the amount of  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:51):**  damage they can do or the amount of back grazing they can do so we didn't have a back fence  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:02:56):**  on this field we just kept moving a front fence through and we had some bales fed out  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:00):**  there as well and that effectively terminated the ryegrass, left quite a lot of the clover  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:05):**  there and then we've gone in and broadcast a mix of black oats, forage oats, we've got  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:12):**  a fodder turnip that's a very thin tap-rooted one that's good for compaction and we've also  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:19):**  got fodder radish mixed in there as well and then on top of that we've got some deep rooted  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:23):**  grasses mixed in that seed mix, tall fescue, meadow fescue, cocksfoot, the legumes are  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:30):**  there already and that will give us some quick annual growth that we can either make a quick  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:35):**  silage from, catch that or we can graze through there and we're establishing a more diverse  
**[0:03:40-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-rob-havard#t=0:03:40):**  lay that will then go on and the annuals will probably drop out over time.

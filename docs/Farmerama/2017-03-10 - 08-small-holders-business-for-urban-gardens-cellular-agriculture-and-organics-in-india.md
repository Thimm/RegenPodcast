## 08: Small-holders, business for urban gardens, cellular agriculture and organics in India  
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmerama as we happily hop into spring. Lots of work to be done in the fields,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:09):**  although of course the hungry gap is upon us so we won't be seeing the fruits of all  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:13):**  the labour for a few months yet.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:15):**  This month we get into some meaty discussions as we hear from cellular agriculturist Abby  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:22):**  Glencross about her vision for a sustainable farming future.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:27):**  Anna visits Keats Community Organics to unearth some business tips for urban farmers.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:32):**  And all the way from the Highlands of Scotland we hear from Keisha Crawford-Avis, our newest  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:38):**  contributor.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:39):**  And finally to India and Rohit Jain, a young Indian entrepreneur and farmer who has rejuvenated  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:45):**  the farming landscape in Udaipur, India.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:50):**  So first Abby went to visit another Abby, Abby Glencross, Abby G, who's the first  
**[0:00:56-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:00:56):**  UK funded cellular agriculturist. And she makes animal products. Without any animals.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:03):**  So I work on thick bovine muscle tissue, which is essentially steak. So I grow a steak in  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:09):**  the lab.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:11):**  Steak in the lab?  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:12):**  I'm not really too sure what to make of this, Joe. It's certainly unorthodox. So I don't  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:19):**  really see how this fits in with my vision for a smaller scale farming future.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:26):**  Well actually Nigel, from Abby G's point of view, she's on the same side as you in the  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:30):**  battle against mass agriculture. Let's have a look and see if she can convince you.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:35):**  Basically we're fighting the same fight, or we're facing the same challenges, which is  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:39):**  things like economy of scale, of large scale farming, industrial farming. So if we can  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:44):**  work together to get rid of that, then we've both got our own kind of niche markets. It's  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:50):**  not going to get rid of small scale farming. People are always going to want meat. And  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:54):**  actually farming, as you guys know, can be used for land management and biodiversity  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:01:58):**  and everything like that. So actually if we can connect on that kind of personal level  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  and realise we're both against the same thing and trying to get rid of the same thing, then  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:07):**  hopefully we'll actually make a difference together.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:09):**  I come from a really rural background and I also come from an engineering background  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:13):**  now. And I think that once you realise that science and engineering are in everything  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:18):**  in our society, that in every food we eat, unless you kind of use land that has never  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  been touched and grow from your own seeds sort of thing, it's just every part of it.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:29):**  People think it's scary because they think there's a load of nutty professors in white  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  coats playing with life. But actually we're just doing another form of farming. And certain  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:41):**  types of farming have evolved over the ages. We never used to farm from the word dot, like  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:46):**  we used to scavenge for our food. So there is this evolution timeline and like cellular  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:53):**  agriculture or like culturing is just another part of that timeline. When industrialisation  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  came in, people thought were horrified and now that unfortunately has become the norm.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:02):**  So maybe this is like an alternative form, but hopefully it's better for everyone involved  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:09):**  in things like industrialisation.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:12):**  So do you still need animals even when you're growing lab meat? Do you need animals as the  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:18):**  starting point?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:19):**  Yeah, so we take a muscle biopsy from a cow. My supervisor who makes the burgers showed  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  me the process. We take a biopsy and you must separate out muscle stem cells which are in  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:33):**  the muscle fibres and you multiply them from one to many by just feeding them sort of thing.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:39):**  But you do need a cow to begin with but it doesn't kill the cow sort of thing. Steak  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  is more complex and I know there's fat involved and capillaries, nervous system, so it is  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  a work in progress. But tissue engineering to put back into people, that's kind of quite  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:03:56):**  a developed field as it is, so there's a lot of literature to work from.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:00):**  I still think that a lot of smaller scale farmers would say I just don't understand  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:05):**  how what you're doing is going to benefit me in any way.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:09):**  And I've totally come up against that too. When I went home some of my friends just wouldn't  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:14):**  speak to me, they didn't want to know. But like I said, they are coming up against big  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:19):**  farms, different types of farming that are alien to them and producing really awful things  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:26):**  for the planet. Even the waste goes into massive cesspools and things like that. So they are  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:31):**  combating that and everyone that I know is involved in cellular agriculture has the drive  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:37):**  to get rid of that large scale polluting, toxic farming that's kind of become the norm.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:45):**  So like I said, people are always going to eat meat, you're never going to stop everyone  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:49):**  in the world eating meat, so why not take that market, try and reduce it so that just  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:04:55):**  the small scale farmers doing it right can feed as much of that market as possible and  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:02):**  then we can sort of subsidise that sort of thing rather than these big companies that  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:07):**  we're all fighting against. It could even be used in places that you can't farm as well,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:12):**  or where like for example in some countries farming on a small scale is people's livelihoods  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:18):**  like entirely and then they'll have a flood or a drought or whatever and their livestock  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:23):**  will die and then they have no way to make money. It's not a country where they will  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:27):**  be supported. So what if you could introduce cellular agriculture as a way that farmers  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:32):**  will always be supported or they can do that themselves as well because they already have  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:37):**  a herd of animals. So maybe in that sense it can be used together as well. It doesn't  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:42):**  have to be us and them either, you can integrate both into the same thing. So I think it's  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:49):**  more diverse than people realise.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:53):**  What do you think Nigel, friend or foe? Would you have a cellular meat lab on your farm?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:05:58):**  Maybe fuelled by tissue from one of your heritage heifers?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:02):**  I'm not convinced Joe. It just seems so far-fetched. It's something out of a science fiction novel  
**[0:06:10-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:10):**  and I would just have to understand the process better to really support something like this  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:19):**  because I think it's... I just don't know what to think.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:28):**  Find the process and maybe taste it too because that's a big part of this.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:33):**  The taste test would be pretty important but also I think it's the ooh, it's grown in a  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:41):**  lab, this is not a natural product. It concerns me that making this stuff from a pastry dish  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:48):**  or something, it just seems very odd and it doesn't stack up. Certainly coming from a  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:06:55):**  farming tradition of many hundreds of years and this is very new and I just, yeah, I think  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:00):**  I would need to learn more, taste, smell, test it.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:04):**  But Abby, you were the person who was there speaking to her. What was your take?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  Well I too am very sceptical of lab-grown meat and have been since the beginning because  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  for me it could be a very dark future of meat being grown in huge labs that are owned by  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:24):**  massive corporations and I just see that as really scary future food. But what I found  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:31):**  really refreshing about Abby G was that she's very open-minded and she's very keen to talk  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  to smaller scale farmers about how can what she's doing be part of what they see as a  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:45):**  resilient future of food. I think Abby G feels that the technology that she's creating really  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:51):**  doesn't have to go in the more scary direction that we're all thinking in our heads.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:07:57):**  I think the scary direction is kind of cool. I can imagine a, I mean I'm not convinced  
**[0:08:02-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:02):**  either right now, but I can see a future where I could find this. Not just okay but exciting.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:13):**  From the lab to the magical remote highlands of Scotland, it's now time to hook up with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  Perthshire smallholder Keisha Crawford-Davies. As we found defining farmer is often quite  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:26):**  complex and the definition of a small scale farm is really quite variable. Even in the  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:32):**  UK we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle often. Farmer or grower, smallholder or crofter.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:38):**  Keisha investigates in this report from the Scottish Smallholder Festival.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:50):**  This is Keisha. I'm back from a fantastic day at the Scottish Smallholder. One of the  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:08:57):**  reasons we moved out here to the edge of the highlands was because of how beautiful the  
**[0:09:04-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:04):**  landscape is. But once we're here it's become quite noticeable how remote we really are  
**[0:09:15-0:09:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:15):**  and how that actually affects our daily life. So having occasions like the Smallholder Festival  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:24):**  or conference where you are with other people who have similar issues, it just reminds you  
**[0:09:31-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:31):**  that you're part of a much bigger whole. How do you think smallholders differ from farmers?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:40):**  I think it's really different. I don't like the two labels being separate because I don't  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  think it's just as straightforward as that. And I think that the line is as stretched  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:52):**  as it is. Somebody who farms on a small scale but generally has another income that comes  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:09:57):**  in. And I think more and more as agriculture is changing, the line that you would draw  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:02):**  in the sand if you want to draw a line between smallholding and farming is actually moving.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  More and more farming families are generating income from off-farm. It's interesting you  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:12):**  talking about lines because obviously being in Scotland we've got crofting as well. So  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:19):**  the differences or the similarities actually between crofting and smallholding, are they  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:25):**  one and the same thing but just different from a historical point of view? Yes, well  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:32):**  they are basically the same in many cases. I think the fundamental difference with crofting,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:38):**  apart from the legislative differences, are that the vast majority of crofts are tenanted  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  whereas the vast majority of smallholdings are owner occupied. And I think that is a  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  fundamental difference and I think it makes a difference to how they operate. If the First  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  Minister of Scotland was to come and ask me, I think we should simplify the crofting legislation  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:00):**  and I think we should extend it to the whole of Scotland. Where people in the lowlands  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:04):**  can register their properties as being crofts, that would set certain responsibilities on  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:10):**  them in terms of using that land for agriculture, horticulture, forestry. But they would receive  
**[0:11:18-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:18):**  some benefit from that, whether that would be the permission to build a house or access  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  to loans or whatever. Crofters obviously tend to be much more rural and there are obviously  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  issues if you are in some of these areas of Scotland of connectivity, infrastructure,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:38):**  access to other services. So there are differences but I think the similarities are actually  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:46):**  greater than the differences.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  Because I do wonder if sometimes because of these lines it also stops the transfer of  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:11:56):**  knowledge because I think another difference I would say is that smallholders, a lot of  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:02):**  them are new into farming whereas crofting might have been in the family for generations.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:06):**  I am not saying all smallholders are like that but I just wonder if there is knowledge  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:11):**  within the crofting community that smallholders could really benefit from and likewise the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:18):**  other way around because of the similar sizes and scales of the operations.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:23):**  I would agree with that. I also think one of the differences between crofters and smallholders  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:30):**  and I don't mean this as a criticism, crofters take themselves much more seriously. My impression  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:37):**  is that they very much recognise the contribution that they make to the communities that they  
**[0:12:42-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:42):**  live and work in whereas smallholders, I don't think we as a group recognise the contributions  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  that we make in terms of producing local food and access to food and giving people access  
**[0:12:57-0:13:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:12:57):**  to information about food and farming and I think smallholders need to get better.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:12):**  Something that actually came throughout all the talks from improving wildflower meadows  
**[0:13:17-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:17):**  to marketing and selling your business online to permaculture was about encouraging linking  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:30):**  and encouraging linking in a positive way and creating communities, be that creating  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:39):**  communities between plants in a permaculture garden or creating communities of people who  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  are going to transfer skills and knowledge or customers if you're talking about online  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  marketing but it's all really about encouraging linking and I suppose that's about encouraging  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:02):**  the ecosystem that we live in, that we are a part of. It was a great day and I very much  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  recommend anyone to come to the one next year and in the meantime if you're in Lanark in  
**[0:14:14-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:14):**  September come along to the smallholders show.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  Keisha actually just got in touch with us on Twitter and made this recording for us  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:31):**  or for you on her phone so if any of you hear something interesting and feel like doing  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:38):**  the same thing then please do talk to us about it or you know Twitter's good or you can email  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:43):**  us through the website as ever our Twitter is at farmerama underscore underscore our  
**[0:14:48-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:14:48):**  website is farmerama dot co.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:02):**  Urban farming has taken quite a hammering in recent weeks headlines like is urban farming  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:07):**  only for rich hipsters? No! And the publication in the US of a survey which concluded that  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:14):**  most urban farmers aren't making a living. Kind of a depressing title really.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:20):**  But closer to home Hannah's been involved with many an urban farm initiative and she's  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:24):**  keen to buck these trends so she headed off to Keats Community Farm in South London and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:30):**  gleaned three top tips for the urban grower.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:34):**  First up what about selling plants as well as food to make a bit of extra income?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:38):**  Sorry so Jack was saying they're going to be focusing on selling plants this year as  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:43):**  something new to try and get some income in but it's really good because once you take  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:48):**  those to market if they don't sell you can take them back and then you can try again  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:52):**  or you can use them so you're not getting that waste.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:55):**  Perfect just keep on repotting them. Yeah so that's the idea to have something that's  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:15:59):**  kind of lower maintenance and less risk than doing a market store where you just like harvest  
**[0:16:06-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:06):**  loge and loge and take it down. And then potentially you've got a lot to lose.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:17):**  Tip number two a handy tip for making the most of boxes.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:20):**  Oh sorry there's some crates behind me. Blue crates and you take them to the rush huts  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:25):**  like that? Yes.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:26):**  Wicked! Okay. Put a bit of paper underneath. That's a really good idea and then you get  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:32):**  them back. Yeah. So we're always on the scavenge for those.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  Yes. And we just obviously we've never bought any it's just you just see sometimes on a  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:41):**  night out. They're so useful though. Yeah. A massive load by the market. Yeah. So by  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  using these crates they're not having to like seal up a ton of plastic bags which again  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  cost money isn't very environmentally friendly. And they fit in the fridges they're aerated  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:16:58):**  they're stuck that's a great solution. Pretty much harvest straight into them so you only  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:02):**  have to handle the salad once or twice. It's actually ended up that we've we've we've  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:09):**  we've harvested into these. But then yeah they're straight into the fridge which is  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:13):**  like you've got to keep it cool you've got to keep it fresh.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:20):**  When everyone understands the importance of eating seasonally as a grower you need to  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  push this message. But yeah we try to have a real understanding of what people will order  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:29):**  every week you know and try and set up a standing order with them which is basically okay every  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:34):**  week you have this and then Chrissie will also push extra on them every week as well.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:38):**  Good girl. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah because they don't know what's ready or yeah. No  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:42):**  they want to know what's good. Exactly. But basically we picked restaurants that profess  
**[0:17:48-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  to cook seasonally and sauce locally. Yeah. It's kind of difficult to you know when somebody's  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  calling you up and being like I've heard you guys are really into local produce and we're  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:01):**  a farm that's two miles away I think it's then really difficult for them to be like  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:05):**  turn it down. No. Yeah. We've got a local supplier in Italy. Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  Totally. Yeah.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:14):**  Hannah now a treasured regular contributor with Jack and Christina with some tips from  
**[0:18:19-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:19):**  the urban farmer at Keats Community Farm. And if you're a grower looking for a bit of  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:33):**  extra support on whatever scale then we can recommend the Capital Growth Network. They  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:39):**  can support you with advice, training, discounts and a wide network of over 2000 gardens and  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:46):**  growers throughout the City of London. Though of course of interest to those of you further  
**[0:18:53-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  afield. And finally we talked to Rohit, a young entrepreneur based near the city of  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:04):**  Udaipur, India who we met in Italy last year. So what's he up to?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:09):**  We run a farmers club where we have 148 farmers who are working with us and we are collectively  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:19):**  collecting their produce. And also like we like yeah first why we started this because  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:24):**  we want to revive our all the indigenous seeds and indigenous recipes. But what I found if  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:32):**  like farmer will grow all the indigenous seeds and process it when they will get a market.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:38):**  So we started a store in Udaipur, it's a city and we connect consumer to farmer so they  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:45):**  get farmers get better price and consumer get a good food. So it's at the local system  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  where the and no middlemen except that's collective. So farmers sell their all the produce to our  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:19:55):**  collective and then our collective sell to the consumer and most of farmers are involved  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:03):**  in the processing. Now like we have introduced millets in a different form, in a form like  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:08):**  so we introduce millet cookies, millet punch like you can just add water in that and just  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:16):**  drink for a healthy punch. So that's revived all our indigenous seeds and recipes. So we  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:23):**  are working towards this. They are realizing like through chemicals and all these things  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:27):**  their soil is getting spoiled. So they don't want to do chemical farming. And like after  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:32):**  our collectives and they can come back to their traditional practices and if there will  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:40):**  be any losses but the people will be there to support them. So now they don't have a  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:45):**  fear of getting losses in the farming. So it's a natural. So there will be some disaster,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:52):**  there will be some losses but it should be community based. So that's why we make a community  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:20:57):**  for farmers to consumers. So if something happens and something bad happens in the field  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:01):**  so then the consumers should be ready to bear this. A consumer comes like once in a year  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:08):**  and twice in a year to just see how we are doing and to connect also they want to connect  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:14):**  to the farmers like who is growing for them. So that's it. But we have like we have physical  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:21):**  store at CT area so where they can easily find their products.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:28):**  And how do you kind of organize that? Is it like through a website or?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:33):**  No no no no. Although I am a software engineer but yeah we have website but we don't use  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  website for this. It's just like a phone you call it you come and actually in India I don't  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:46):**  know about the other part of the world but I know about India. The psychology of like  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:52):**  because in India like generally housewives cook for the whole family and yeah. So the  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  women want to feel their products like how it looks like. So they generally don't prefer  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  to buy all these products from the internet. In metro cities it's prefer. Like Udaipur  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:10):**  is a small town so where women want to see their products and they come and then order.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:17):**  And yeah most of them order through the phone. They have seen like they have seen our products  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:21):**  earlier so they just yeah okay you send this stuff at our place and we have like a person  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:29):**  who supply like who do home delivery. It's our fourth year. We started three years before  
**[0:22:35-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:35):**  like it's fourth year is running. And so we have a store in city city's heart and slowly  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:44):**  slowly like 15 to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 120 and then 250 and now it's reached to 800.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:51):**  How does it make the farmers feel and yourself being part of the collective? How do you feel?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:22:56):**  Young farmers doesn't want to do like don't want to do farming right. And so when we started  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/08-farmerama#t=0:23:02):**  this consumer like consumer meet go to the farmers and meet so then they realize they

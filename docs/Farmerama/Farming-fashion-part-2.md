**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:00:00):**  If we think about regenerative agriculture, regenerative systems, what we're doing is  we're regenerating the soil and when we do that we regenerate the carbon cycle, we regenerate  the biodiversity in our soils and we also regenerate our human ecology or our human  
**[0:00:21-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:00:21):**  economy. As soon as you move into a regenerative farming model, you know, as a horticulturalist  or somebody growing grain, you have to put the livestock back into the system. So you  grow crops for a couple of years, then you have to put your soil to rest with deep-rooting  
**[0:00:37-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:00:37):**  green manures for a couple of years. And the best thing to do with those green manures  then is to graze them off with cattle for milk or for beef, for sheep, for fibre but  also for meat or I guess milk and or chickens. And so you weave a more complex system, it  
**[0:00:59-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:00:59):**  becomes more interesting, the community regathers around a farm and those farms become more  economically viable because they have more products to sell.  My name is Marina O'Connell, I'm a horticulturalist and I set up and developed Hudson's Cross  
**[0:01:19-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:01:19):**  Farm, the apricot center which is based at Hudson's Cross Farm in Partington in South  Devon and we weave together permaculture design with biodynamic practice.  In building our regional networks of fibre and dye farmers, processors, mills and designers,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:01:41):**  fiber sheds across the world are showing that it is possible to produce high quality and  profitable fibres and dyes within nature beneficial systems. The problem is that the connection  between farming and fashion has been lost. In this series we'll be exploring the challenges  
**[0:01:56-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:01:56):**  that farmers and processors face as well as the experiences and needs of designers and  we'll also dig into what a regenerative fashion system could look like by hearing from those  already pioneering the path across the British Isles.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:02:15):**  In the last episode we heard from sheep farmers who talked to us about the benefits of farming  regeneratively for their land, their animals and their wool but also the challenge of making  the fibre aspect of their business viable. In this second episode of the Farming Fashion  
**[0:02:30-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:02:30):**  series we'll hear from farmers who are diversifying into fibre processing. Currently one of the  biggest challenges that we're facing today is the lack of small to mid scale fibre processing  infrastructure across the country. David Wilkins along with his wife Ruth run the UK's newest  
**[0:02:46-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:02:46):**  fibre spinning mill, Rampersham Hill Mill, which opened in Dorset earlier this year and  caters for small batch processing. It specialises in semi-wasted spinning which is a way of  processing fibres similar to worsted where the fibres are made to lie parallel to one  
**[0:03:02-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:03:02):**  another before spinning. This makes for smooth, strong yarns but the semi-wasted process makes  them a bit more bouncy or airy than the very silky worsted yarns.  There is a place for wool in almost any market really, obviously you go back a few hundred  
**[0:03:17-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:03:17):**  years and it was one of the few options people had and certain breeds of sheep were almost  created for estate workers or a particular town and that was the sort of stamp, in inverted  commas that that wool was sold as their local product.  
**[0:03:35-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:03:35):**  I am David Wilkins and along with my wife Ruth Wilkins we have set up Rampersham Hill  Mill which is a small scale semi-wasted processing plant and we're based in Dorset in southern  England and take on the bespoke and custom processing of clients sheep's wool fibre.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:04:00):**  Rampersham Hill Mill is a new semi-wasted mill which we opened for custom processing  in September 2001 but the idea came about really six to eight years ago where we were  selling a lot of raw fleeces, arts and crafts and spinning, all sorts of artisan and individual  
**[0:04:19-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:04:19):**  business needs and we were getting a lot of enquiries about people who had fleeces and  the wool values were fluctuating and they would like us to do something with their fleeces  for them really or could we process our fleeces further because they didn't have the facilities  
**[0:04:34-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:04:34):**  themselves and unfortunately the answers were always no, no and no.  It got to the point where really there was just so many enquiries coming in we thought  there is actually a need for some more smaller scale mills in the UK and then about three  
**[0:04:50-0:05:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:04:50):**  years ago we looked at getting all the relevant permissions and it's taken three years to  actually get the mill up and running but really the inspiration has come from the need to  get back to smaller scale production, more unique production and local supply and production  
**[0:05:10-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:05:10):**  for a lot of businesses within the particularly the south west but also the United Kingdom.  There has been a strong demand for professional production of the smaller batches where individuals  either don't have the sheer volume of fibre that the bigger mills require due to just  
**[0:05:30-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:05:30):**  the size of their machines, their production techniques and things like that or they have  multiple breeds and therefore they want to do a little bit of each breed rather than  a large quantity of one breed which then potentially, obviously depending on their product, gives  
**[0:05:46-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:05:46):**  them less choice for their end designs, end product and obviously the consumer.  When we built Ramsham Hill Mill because we were able to do a ground up rebuild we were  able to utilise the leading technologies.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:05:59):**  Not only did we design it to be exactly the right size and shape and layout for our processing  set up we were planning to undertake but we could also use very high performing insulated  steel composite panels, we can get all our heating and our hot water from an air source  
**[0:06:18-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:06:18):**  heat pump and because we're lucky we've got the roof space on the new building we're able  to put a large solar array on it.  So right from the start we have very much in the forefront that we need to produce this  
**[0:06:30-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:06:30):**  building to the highest specification of really green technology we can at the time of build  which was made during 2020 and 2021.  We also use organic approved wall scouring detergent so that's very gentle on the fibres  
**[0:06:46-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:06:46):**  and the environments and our spinning oils and products that we apply to the fibres are  generally all biodegradable and easily scarrable out with just normal water which again helps  the end consumer to know that really the full chain has been as green as we possibly can  
**[0:07:03-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:07:03):**  from the start.  Here at Ramsham Hill Mill we generally have a lot of people who are very very local to  us and they will drop their fibre off, we'll process it and they'll pick it up.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:07:14):**  It's very encouraging to see how much of our work is coming from a small radius of the  premises.  These mills are few and far between in the UK so we do get inquiries coming from all  
**[0:07:28-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:07:28):**  over the country.  Different mills specialise in different products and have different manufacturers and styles  of machinery so sometimes we might not be the most suitable mill for the customer's  
**[0:07:42-0:07:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:07:42):**  end product that they're wishing to achieve.  We have to be realistic as well that just because we might be on someone's doorstep  we might not actually be the most efficient way or even possible to achieve the specification  
**[0:07:55-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:07:55):**  they want because of the machinery we run.  We are a semi-worsted mill which means we can generally accept fibres between about  6cm up to 20cm but obviously there's good and bad breeds and good and bad fibres within  
**[0:08:11-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:08:11):**  that.  One thing we have to be very clear with the client to start with is that not all breeds  are suitable for all specifications of yarn or products and it's very important when we  
**[0:08:24-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:08:24):**  do the design work with designers and new products that actually designers know a little  bit about the breed of sheep or the size of yarn they are proposing to use to actually  see if it's going to make them a really good sellable product.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:08:38):**  So we have various breeds in the UK which are known for different characteristics so  something like the Shetlands have lovely fine soft fibres.  You get something like the Romneys or the Gotlands, they are very lustrous and flat  
**[0:08:57-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:08:57):**  of fibre and are more suited to finer binning.  You get things like the Downbreeds, lovely crimpy bouncy fibre as a result the yarns  are nice and airy and bouncy yarns, springy yarns and therefore they're slightly more  
**[0:09:13-0:09:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:09:13):**  suited to a little bit thicker yarns.  Woolen mills throughout the ages have been key to industries not just in the UK but around  the world and the skills and the knowledge that is being passed down through history  
**[0:09:29-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:09:29):**  and generations from mills in literature and obviously in some cases actually family members  is invaluable and will help people to ensure that only the best fibre is sent for processing  because at the end of the day the better the inputting fibre the mill receives the better  
**[0:09:51-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:09:51):**  the output of the product will be.  The machines in the middle will do the processing but they can't really produce miracles so  if the fibre is damaged or not of a high quality start with then they are not going to be able  
**[0:10:04-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:10:04):**  to improve that quality as it goes through the processing.  Farmers are there to look after the landscape, look after their animals, the welfare, the  conditions they farm in are paramount to the success of their farm and really we're taking  
**[0:10:19-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:10:19):**  the product in this case wool, helping the producer to create a nice quality fibre, working  with them to let them understand why some particular individual animals might not have  higher quality fibre as others and therefore select the right fibres so that when the fibre  
**[0:10:37-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:10:37):**  comes to the mill we have the best chance of giving them a very high quality fibre back.  So I think one of the stand out insights from what David said here is that farmers and designers  alike should be paying attention to the quality of the fleece that ends up at the mill and  
**[0:10:56-0:11:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:10:56):**  that ultimately determines what the quality is of the end product.  So a mill who is being highly selective and perhaps turning fleece away is actually a  mill that is working with integrity and I know in the short term it can be demoralising  
**[0:11:09-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:11:09):**  but in the long term it's well worth the producer taking the time to learn from the mill what's  going to be good for spinning and what isn't and what wool from what breeds are suited  to different uses and to take the time on the farm as well to sort the good from the  
**[0:11:23-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:11:23):**  bad before it goes anywhere.  We have a deep historical relationship with wool in this country and that includes fibre  farming, processing and trading. We still produce tens of thousands of tonnes of wool  
**[0:11:41-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:11:41):**  a year which is mostly sold to overseas buyers but there are still facilities across the  country, many family run, which specialise in processing wool and other animal fibres  such as alpaca or mohair. But plant fibres are another story. With the introduction of  
**[0:11:57-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:11:57):**  cotton in the late 1600s produced through colonial exploitation of lands and labour  overseas, the production of linen from our native flax quickly disappeared, sealed by  the closure of Britain's last linen weaving mill in Scotland just last year.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:12:12):**  I first read about fibreshed in the middle of 2020 and that is actually what made me  want to do my whole project because I was just blown away by the book. My name is Rosie  Bristow and I'm currently a student at Heriot-Watt. I'm doing an MSc in Fashion and Textile  
**[0:12:33-0:12:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:12:33):**  Management and my dissertation project is on flax and hemp processing equipment. Alongside  my dissertation I've also been running a sort of practical project where last year I  grew a hectare of flax in collaboration with George Young at Fobbing Farms and then I've  
**[0:12:53-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:12:53):**  also been working on getting the flax processing equipment built. So we've now got three different  prototype machines. So that's kind of part of my research but also a bit of an extracurricular  project that's running alongside it. The main focus of my project at the moment is looking  
**[0:13:14-0:13:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:13:14):**  at the processing equipment and really looking at how can we actually set up flax or hemp  textile economy in the UK. What are the practical steps that we need to take? The real missing  link is the milling equipment so the braking, scutching, heckling and then spinning equipment  
**[0:13:36-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:13:36):**  is all missing in the UK. So that's what I'm focusing on researching at the moment. Different  options for how we could get the infrastructure back. I'm also really interested in what that  might look like in terms of how it would fit into a community in the future. I am imagining  
**[0:13:58-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:13:58):**  a kind of fibreshed model of it being rather than a linear supply chain it's like a local  supply network so there's lots of different people involved. I would define a fibreshed  as the local area where you can draw all of your fibre resources from so I guess it's  
**[0:14:19-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:14:19):**  just taken from the idea of a watershed but for fibre and using local fibre, local dye,  local labour and about it being not just a linear supply chain but like a supply network  and the fact that it's all natural means that it's therefore all compostable as well. I  
**[0:14:43-0:15:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:14:43):**  think there is the potential to set up this business model where it's like a network of  lots of different businesses that all feed into each other. So I was giving the example  of the woodland tannery which uses the waste products from small-scale abattoir and the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:15:00):**  waste products from wood coppicing and tree surgery business like all the bark and like  oat gulls and stuff and then that tans the skins from the animals and then the waste  products from that in turn become the start of like another thing. Flax and hemp have  
**[0:15:19-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:15:19):**  that capacity which isn't being explored at the moment because you can harvest them for  the seeds and you can harvest them for the fibre and then the waste products you get  all of the shiv and the woody core can be used for like animal bedding or it can even  
**[0:15:37-0:15:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:15:37):**  be used in a sort of concrete like hemp creek thing they're like a really interconnected  web and like Fantasy Farm where I was volunteering last year have a sort of similar thing but  they have the sawmill and like tree surgeons on site and then that means that we get all  
**[0:15:53-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:15:53):**  the wood chip for doing the like pathways and the no dig beds. I love seeing how there's  like businesses within businesses and I think what I can really imagine that I want to set  up in the future is kind of like a fibre mill I guess but one that's like situated within  
**[0:16:11-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:16:11):**  a vegetable farm or some kind of small scale farm set up. For example there'd be like flax  growing in rotation with wheat but then also that you might use the waste products from  the vegetable farm like onion skins for dyeing and so it would be trying to integrate it  
**[0:16:29-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:16:29):**  both into the local environment landscape the way that it's being farmed in rotation  with other crops but then also integrate it into like the local community so that it's  actually creating jobs which are like interesting fun jobs. The scale is really important not  
**[0:16:49-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:16:49):**  just going let's copy the machinery that exists in Holland for example and buy a huge scutching  mill but thinking what is the best possible scale of economy that we want to try and build.  There isn't anything in the UK other than historical reenactment hand tools so like  
**[0:17:12-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:17:12):**  spinning wheels and like little wooden tools. What I'm really looking into is like a medium  scale of equipment so it's much more efficient than medieval style hand tools but less huge  than a five million pound factory. I'm really excited about collaborating with like these  
**[0:17:31-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:17:31):**  different people who've been working on open source designs and I think that's like a real  strength of all the different fiber shed projects is like international collaboration. I know  that there's lots of other companies who are all tackling this problem simultaneously how  
**[0:17:48-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:17:48):**  do we have medium scale processing equipment because the huge industrial stuff is all under  copyright and it's like intellectual property of the companies I can't just ring them up  and be like oh can I build one of those they're not going to give me their plans. Whereas  
**[0:18:03-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:18:03):**  the open source stuff I think that's what's really exciting because we can have both a  global movement whilst it also being a local movement for the project so just because we're  wanting to do like a local product doesn't mean that we're trying to go back in time  
**[0:18:23-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:18:23):**  and ignore the rest of the world. I think the international collaboration is really  helpful and something I'm quite keen on which I think is quite radical because everybody  at the university has told me not to do it. I'm really keen on the idea of once I've got  
**[0:18:37-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:18:37):**  these designs is to make them open source and just share them for free on the internet  because what I really want to see is sustainable fashion being something that's accessible  to everybody wherever they live. If I do manage to create these machines to do flax and hemp  
**[0:18:54-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:18:54):**  processing that are successful and easy to build easy to repair I want to disseminate  that information as far as possible and not put an intellectual copyright on it and be  like oh I'm the only flax mill in the UK everybody has to come to me like that's not what I want  
**[0:19:11-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:19:11):**  to do because I've been trying to raise the money through applying to these entrepreneurial  schemes at the university they're really not keen on that and they're like oh no you've  got to get your get your intellectual property and like oh don't tell anybody about your  
**[0:19:25-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:19:25):**  ideas in case they steal them and I'm like no I want people to steal my ideas I want  to create a movement of you know so every town or village can have its own local little  production I don't want to be producing everybody's flax in the whole country I don't have time  
**[0:19:42-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:19:42):**  to want to make machines that you can just make out of bits that you've got lying around  and although obviously my project is trying to create new stuff I actually think the best  solution for 90% of the time is learn how to fix and like really treasure what you already  
**[0:20:01-0:20:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:20:01):**  have and I think that's where the focus should be and then at some point we're going to need  new clothes and you know maybe by that point I'll have like figured out how to set up a  flax spinning mill in like a few years into the future but I think in terms of like sustainable  
**[0:20:16-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:20:16):**  fashion for like everyday people learn how to dance that's the thing I think everybody  should be doing.  The heart of the British Isles remaining linen industry can be found in Ireland which is  
**[0:20:32-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:20:32):**  world renowned for the high quality of the products produced. These days even Ireland  has no spinning mills and the cloth that is manufactured today uses flax that is grown  elsewhere. Malin linen is an arable farm in County Tyrone that's reinvigorating this heritage  
**[0:20:48-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:20:48):**  industry in Ireland, growing the fibre and looking to do the processing into textiles  on the site.  Irish linen is renowned around the world Belfast was known as Linenopolis at a time and you  
**[0:21:05-0:21:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:21:05):**  can still see it everywhere today in the street names and the building names so you know we  have the Linen Hall Library and Sculptures Lane and Draperstown and you know you have  all of these different names around the place that remind you of what was here. Flax was  
**[0:21:27-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:21:27):**  very much part of agriculture here and the linen industry was very much part of our whole  industrial heritage as well. We went looking for Irish linen and discovered that none of  the linen that you can buy now was actually grown in Ireland and that you know we just  
**[0:21:43-0:21:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:21:43):**  realised that actually it's not it's not grown here at all anymore and it's one of those  things where Charlie said you know we have a farm we could try this you know so that  that's what got us into it in the first instance.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:21:57):**  My name is Helen Keith I'm from Malin linen we have a farm in County Tyrone where we have  for the last four years been growing flax with the aim of eventually processing it through  to textile. So every farm at a time would have grown some flax. We had big companies  
**[0:22:18-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:22:18):**  here as well like Mackeys who designed the machinery and held all the patents or a lot  of the patents and they exported machinery all over the world and there's a brilliant  project a guy has done where he's documented all the different mills around Northern Ireland  
**[0:22:34-0:22:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:22:34):**  and when you look at his map it's just covered you know there were there were mills every  few miles. We have been restoring an old Mackeys scotching turbine and it's a much quicker  process than doing it by hand and you get your nice line fibre at the other end of that  
**[0:22:53-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:22:53):**  and then we hit our real stumbling block because then if you were processing right through  to linen you need to get it spun at that stage. Hackled and spun. There's no spinning mills  in anywhere in the UK or Ireland as far as I know I keep waiting for somebody to tell  
**[0:23:10-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:23:10):**  me that there is one that I just didn't know about but I still haven't managed to find  one. Everybody that we talk to is up against the same challenges in terms of you know where  can we get machinery and how do we how do we scale if we want to scale or how do we  
**[0:23:28-0:23:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:23:28):**  make it viable at a sort of smaller cottage industry scale. So I think the approach that  Fibershed are taking in terms of being you know looking at smaller easily replicable  systems is a really good way to go forward because that worked in the past and I think  
**[0:23:46-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:23:46):**  that is the obvious and most sustainable way to do it again. People are very patronising  when they talk about cottage industry you know people use that as an insult almost to  them. Cottage industry does not mean small. Cottage industry can be everywhere, it can  
**[0:24:04-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:24:04):**  be replicated in all kinds of places and it can become a huge thing all over and that  that's what linen was in Northern Ireland years ago. It was a huge industry but it came  from that cottage industry. You know it would have been grown on the farm, it would have  
**[0:24:21-0:24:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:24:21):**  gone to would have been matted generally on the farm as well so those two processes would  have happened on farm. Then would have gone to gone to a scutching mill and from a scutching  mill to the spinning mill and then from spinning to weaving and then occasionally beetling  
**[0:24:38-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:24:38):**  at the end. Not all the time but for some products it would have been beetled at the  end. We don't have any spinning here anymore but there are still good weavers here and  we are very lucky that I think possibly the only beetling mill left in Europe. Beetling  
**[0:24:54-0:25:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:24:54):**  is the sort of finishing process right at the end so if you want to bring a beautiful  sheen and strength to the fabric you can put it onto a beetling engine so it goes around  these big rollers and just huge wooden hammers are dropped down on it so it would be beetled  
**[0:25:14-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:25:14):**  over hours and hours and hours or maybe even days it would stay on the beetling rollers  and we are very lucky that William Clark's Upperlands is very nearby here and they are  leading a real revolution in textiles and beetling and so on and they are supplying  
**[0:25:31-0:25:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:25:31):**  some of their amazing beetled fabric to some of the big names in fashion. Some of their  textile was used in Alexander McQueen at the Paris Fashion Show and I know there is some  really exciting stuff happening this year as well so it is just so brilliant to see  
**[0:25:49-0:26:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:25:49):**  that end of the process being valued and still happening. So we have a farm that is about  50 acres in County Tyrone, right in the middle of County Tyrone. It would have traditionally  been years and years ago in our grandparents time would have been a mixed farm. We still  
**[0:26:08-0:26:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:26:08):**  got nice old meadows and lots of woodland and lots of native species and so on but we  also need to be productive and I see flax and this crop rotation system that we are  bringing in as a way for us to become more profitable and more productive on the farm  
**[0:26:26-0:26:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:26:26):**  but still maintain the nature friendly aspects that we have and that we really treasure.  There is a lot of pressure on farming now. We are all on a mission to net zero and we  have to look at ways that we can achieve that and I see crops like flax as being really  
**[0:26:44-0:27:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:26:44):**  important to help us get to that stage where we need to get to because it allows us to  find that balance between making a profit but also being nature friendly. In terms of  the crop rotation, it is important not to grow flax in the same place two years because  
**[0:27:03-0:27:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:27:03):**  it actually is quite hard on the soil. It likes poor soil. You don't want to put it  on very heavily fertilised soil but when you do put it in it will draw a lot out of the  soil so it is really important to have it as part of a rotation and put that all back  
**[0:27:17-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:27:17):**  again and get your soil working for you. We do it as part of a crop rotation. We don't  put it in the same place for seven years, a seven year rotation. That will be some oats,  some potatoes, some grass but over the next few years we gradually want to introduce more  
**[0:27:38-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:27:38):**  and more cereals and other crops like that and much more horticulture onto the farm.  We literally leave it alone for 100 days which is brilliant. It is a very low maintenance  crop. It doesn't need any fertiliser, no nothing. Traditionally they would have said harvest  
**[0:27:54-0:28:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:27:54):**  it at 100 days but the real rule is that it is when it is ripe two thirds of the way up.  We have found actually that it does no harm to go in a little bit early. When it is still  quite green we find that gives still quite good quality fibre. We don't have many qualms  
**[0:28:14-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:28:14):**  about going in a little early before it is two thirds of the way because the danger is  it takes us about a month to harvest it. It is a really big effort to get it harvested.  We give people the coal when we think it is coming ready which we are never 100% sure  
**[0:28:31-0:28:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:28:31):**  about but we set up catering facilities, a composting toilet goes up in the field, tents  appear and there is usually a lot of fun and a lot of cracking. People come and stay for  a few nights and you might get a bit of music. People will work as well and we will pull  
**[0:28:50-0:29:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:28:50):**  the whole field. It does usually take about a month to do it.  It is a very easy crop to pull. There is something quite lovely about doing it because it is  not the hard labour for anyone who has ever worked in hay or potatoes or any other sort  
**[0:29:05-0:29:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:29:05):**  of labour intensive things. Flax is actually much easier and very nice to do. People do  tend to come back every year. It becomes part of your annual summer calendar. The thing  that a lot of people say to me is this is just so good for my soul. An amazing part  
**[0:29:23-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:29:23):**  of Fibershed is that it is so international and I have been on calls with people from  all over America and all over Europe as well. That is one of the great things about Fibershed  is that it feels like it really is a movement and that there is a whole lot of people who  
**[0:29:39-0:29:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:29:39):**  are interested in doing that, doing something there.  I feel like we have all just fallen down a rabbit hole together and we are in it now.  There is a real community and what I love about it is that everybody seems really willing  
**[0:29:55-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:29:55):**  to share what they are doing and share how they are getting on and share what they have  learned. Especially during the growing season, I am on the phone constantly with other farmers  and other growers going how is yours doing? How is mine doing? This has fallen over. What  
**[0:30:13-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:30:13):**  should I do about it? Comparing notes and getting advice for each other. I don't know  any other industry where that is the case that people are so willing to help each other  out and that is what a movement is all about. It is just great to see people who are leading  
**[0:30:28-0:30:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:30:28):**  the charge and leading the way in terms of looking at how we can restore those short  supply chains in local areas and bring locally produced textiles back to reality.  It is really exciting to me that as an industry is emerging, old ideas are being rejuvenated.  
**[0:30:50-0:31:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:30:50):**  In the process we are rediscovering history and hopefully supporting new livelihoods and  forms of craftsmanship that were probably near lost. Because in the process we are rediscovering  history and hopefully supporting new livelihoods and forms of craftsmanship that were probably  
**[0:31:05-0:31:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:31:05):**  near lost. Although with contemporary knowledge of toxic chemicals we are also able to revitalise  these crafts in a more healthy and sustainable way.  Leather is also interesting because although we haven't looked at it for this series, like  
**[0:31:19-0:31:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:31:19):**  wool it is also a by-product of the meat industry which can be a valuable product in its own  right. In the UK we have lost a lot of transparency around what happens to animal hides once they  leave the abattoir but now people are starting to ask questions about this too, such as the  
**[0:31:34-0:31:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/fibershed-episode-2#t=0:31:34):**  incredible Grady and Robinson. And that's for another series.

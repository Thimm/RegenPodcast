**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:07):**  the recent Cultivating Justice series and then our bonus shorts where we featured different  
**[0:00:11-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:11):**  millers from our series Cereal. We've just celebrated our seventh birthday, seven years  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:19):**  of sharing the voices of the regenerative farming movement. We want to take a moment  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:24):**  to thank everyone who's been part of Farmerama episodes in that time. To the farmers producing  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:29):**  food and fiber for us whilst rejuvenating the ecosystems they're working in. This month  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:34):**  we hear how one ranch is managing to build green cover in its 22nd year of drought in  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:39):**  California and about the vineyard they've designed to allow for grazing sheep below  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:43):**  the canopy all year round. And we learn about the roots of the fiber shed movement, again  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:48):**  in California, ahead of the release of our upcoming mini series Farming Fashion from  
**[0:00:54-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:00:54):**  Fiber Shed UK.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:09):**  Sally Calhoun owns and manages the Paisie Neze Ranch. She's also an impact investor,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:15):**  activist and philanthropic funder in regenerative agriculture. She shared with us some signs  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:19):**  of hope in the drought stricken area of the world in which she lives. So the ranch is  
**[0:01:25-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:25):**  about 7600 acres. There is the San Benito River, which is a very seasonal, small river,  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:32):**  runs through it. We have about seven miles of meandering that kind of splits the ranch  
**[0:01:35-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:35):**  in half. We're in a very low rainfall area in the midst so far of 22 years of drought.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:43):**  So we've gotten, we usually get between three and 10 inches of rain a year and sometimes  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:50):**  less these days. So when we arrived on the ranch, I was very interested in regenerating  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:01:57):**  both the California perennial grasses and also the riparian corridor. The riparian corridor  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:01):**  had historically been used to graze 500 cows from the middle of June until the middle of  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:07):**  December and it was basically dust. And so we really are starting in around 2004. We  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:12):**  immediately fenced the river so that it would not be grazed all the time, stopped utilizing  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:17):**  it in that way and then have progressively adopted holistic planned grazing. So the river  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:22):**  has been grazed almost every year for the last 20 years. And what we've seen is really  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:27):**  a regeneration of the riparian corridor. We were very optimistic. We have a lot of willows  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:32):**  and mule fat and all kinds of salt grass creeping wild rye. Very interesting things happening  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:38):**  and we thought it was good. And last year we spoke to some restoration biologists to  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:43):**  see if we could get some mitigation credit or some credit for the ongoing river restoration  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:49):**  and they said, you're pretty much finished. So it's super cool that by just changing the  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:02:54):**  way we manage the grazing in 20 years of drought, but with a river, so there is a lot of water,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:01):**  that we really, we didn't plant a single plant. We didn't have a plan about what should grow  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:06):**  here or what should grow there. We said, we'll see what the river and the land and nature  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:11):**  give us. And it's super cool what we've got now. I mean, they figure that 95% of the riparian  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:17):**  corridors in California have been destroyed, usually because they're on the flamplades  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:21):**  and they're a really good place to farm, right? So it makes sense that they got destroyed.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:26):**  But if you, we were told this is the only corridor like this on the central coast anywhere.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:31):**  And if you fly from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, it is so obvious when you fly over this corridor,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:38):**  because it is by far the largest thing like it that you'll see in that whole trip. So  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:44):**  yeah, we're super psyched about it. I wish we had done some analysis and figured out  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:47):**  how much carbon we've sequestered. So maybe we'll figure out how much carbon is there  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:50):**  now and they'll tell something anyway. When we got here, I didn't know anything, but I  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:03:56):**  was introduced to Alan Savory's work and I'd been growing California native perennial bunch  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:01):**  grasses in my backyard for 15 years and was intrigued by the idea they might be able to  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:06):**  come back here because they're viewed as being mostly extinct in California rangeland. And  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:10):**  in fact, when we got here, we could not find a single cool season California bunch grass  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:14):**  anywhere. We did finally find some very sad looking ones on north facing slopes. So we  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:19):**  knew they were here. Here in California, it's painful because you have to assume that they're  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:24):**  there and graze accordingly, even if you can't see them, which is kind of frustrating. But  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:29):**  we did that we assumed that they were here. And with pretty minor improvements in grazing,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:35):**  like just less overgrazing, we began to see pretty dramatic returns of the purple needle  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:41):**  grass in particular, that's the one that's really come back. And the other one is the  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:44):**  salt grass, which is a sea for grass, a warm season grass, the only one left here. Its  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:49):**  resurgence has also been pretty dramatic. It's kind of come out of the river and is  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:53):**  heading upslope. So yeah, it just seems like if you just, you know, if you just take your  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:04:59):**  foot off their necks, it's amazing what can happen even in such a low rainfall place with  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:05):**  really degraded soils and a totally crashed ecosystem. So sitting as a person who's 22  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:12):**  years into this giant drought, I mean, it just really, I sometimes think I'm so sad  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:18):**  about with this change in management, if it kept raining, what might have been, which  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:22):**  we'll never know. So I don't know over the next 10 to 20 years, if the rainfall stays  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:27):**  down at three inches, five inches a year, I don't know that a lot is going to change,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:30):**  to be perfectly honest. And we know we have not increased soil organic matter. And we  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:36):**  have increased biodiversity. And we'll keep working as hard as we can at increasing biodiversity.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:41):**  But I'm really struck by the realization that if it doesn't rain, it's very hard to improve  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:48):**  or to create any change in the system. So I'm optimistic, you know, that the great flood  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:52):**  will come. And then I think if it would rain, we would be totally astonished at what would  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:05:58):**  happen. I think we have no idea what could happen. But it just takes water. My joke is  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:03):**  that if it just stops raining, we'll put in solar panels and we'll mine the 500-year sand  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:09):**  and gravel pit. It'll be about sun and sand if it just doesn't rain anymore. It's important  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:15):**  to have a backup plan in the 21st century. We need functioning ecosystems. That's the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:22):**  goal here at this point. We've just got to have them all over the planet. We should manage  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:26):**  every square foot of the planet to sequester carbon and create functioning ecosystems.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:33):**  Kelly Mulville is vineyard director at Pisoners Ranch, where he's planted a vineyard that  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:38):**  looks a little different. Originally trained in holistic management, Kelly's designed a  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:43):**  vineyard that allows for animals to graze in it all year round.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:51):**  The first thing that most people notice with the vineyard is that it is a tall trellis.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:06:56):**  So we're using a system called the Watson system developed by a retired petroleum engineer  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:01):**  in Texas. And it actually was not developed, designed for sheep. It was rather designed  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:07):**  for climates that are very hot and humid to help prevent the mildew and make it easier  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:14):**  to manage in those situations. But when I saw that trellis system, I realized that that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:20):**  would probably work very well for sheep. And so one of the aspects of our design is we  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:25):**  wanted sheep to be able to do most of the work for us. I'd done a trial of a vineyard  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:29):**  in Sonoma County where I set it up to graze throughout the growing season. And we had  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:34):**  some really dramatic results in water savings and labor savings and fertility benefits.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:40):**  And so the next step was actually to design something from the get-go that we could graze  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:45):**  without having to do so much modifications. So the idea with this is that we have a trellis  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:51):**  system that enables grazing throughout the growing season of the grapevines as well as  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:07:58):**  during the dormant season. And so in order to do that, we have to raise the trellis system  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:04):**  up so that it's out of reach of the sheep, the important parts, the fruiting zone and  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:09):**  the shoots. But we also want them to do our suckering forest, which are the shoots that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:13):**  come out at the base of the vine and not along the trunk. And we want them to do our shoot  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:18):**  tipping forest as well. So those are the shoots that hang over, they grow up, and then they  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:23):**  hang over and come back into range of the sheep. And so most of those tasks are generally  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:27):**  done by machine or human labor. So we have that design so that the sheep will do that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:33):**  just through their browsing practices.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:35):**  So the first thing people notice is that the trellis is higher. The vines, it's a partial  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:40):**  overhead, it's a V trellis. And so that provides about, the row spacing is 12 feet and the  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:48):**  vines are six feet apart. Once those vines are full, they take up about probably five  
**[0:08:54-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:08:54):**  to six feet of the row in a partial overhead canopy, which allows dappled light and good  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:02):**  exposure to air and partial exposure to the sun. So it's almost like being in a small  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:09):**  orchard rather than a vineyard. And so the fruit is up higher and the vines are up higher.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:15):**  And it has a different feel than when the vines are in rows or in their head trains  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:19):**  on close to the ground.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:22):**  So the sheep are a critical part of our management in this vineyard. And actually, before we've  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:27):**  implanted, we were using what is called holistic plant grazing. Some people refer to it as  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:31):**  mob or intensive grazing. And what that means is we keep the animals bunched up fairly tightly  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:38):**  and they move very often so that we're not overgrazing or over-trampling the site. And  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:45):**  having the vineyard high like this, including our drip wire is high as well. So both humans  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:50):**  and sheep can go any direction in the vineyard. And they're not restricted to just the row  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:09:55):**  itself. And that enables freedom of access. And it also makes it easier for us to set  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:01):**  up temporary fencing inside the vineyard. If we want to have a higher impact of animals  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:07):**  for a shorter period of time, then we can have a very small paddock. And it isn't necessarily  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:11):**  restricted to just one or two rows to do that. So that offers a lot more flexibility. And  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:18):**  we are running sheep in the vineyard during... A lot of it depends on rainfall. We're in  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:24):**  a very low rainfall area, about 12 inches a year is the historic average. The past two  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:29):**  years we've had about five inches. So we're in a pretty good drought. And so the amount  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:34):**  of grazing is dictated by the amount of rainfall we get. And we are in a Mediterranean climate.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:41):**  So we get the rains starting in... The typical rainy season would be October through the  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:47):**  end of April or so. Our rainy season seems to be shrinking with the drought. But that  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:52):**  allows us to graze during the non-growing season. We can graze sheep in the vineyards  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:10:56):**  and we don't have to worry about the vines at that time. And then during the growing  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:00):**  season of the vines or summer, we can graze as well. But because we don't get rainfall  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:05):**  in the summer, that means that the flock is generally smaller. And then typically we're  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:11):**  just using the rams. Our flock here is about 2,000 sheep. So we have somewhere around 25,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:19):**  30 rams. And that's a good number for grazing kind of quickly through the vineyard during  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:25):**  the summer season because there's just not much vegetation. Most of the vegetation is  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:29):**  under the vines themselves. The initial goal of this was to create an agricultural system  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:34):**  that encourages biodiversity and builds biodiversity back into the ecosystem. Most agriculture  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:42):**  actually reduces biodiversity, sometimes really severely, to basically one crop and all insects  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:48):**  and most life is kept out of farming systems. And so we wanted to do the exact opposite.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:11:55):**  And I was a bit inspired by something although Leopold said in that when we restore ecosystems,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:01):**  we may use some of the same tools that we use to destroy them. And that's just so you  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:06):**  just have to change your mindset on how you're using those tools. Animals, for instance.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:09):**  So we're using livestock not to over graze and over trample and create erosion and reduce  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:14):**  biodiversity. We're using them for the opposite reason because the grazing practices that  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:20):**  we are using basically mimic natural grazing animals in an ecosystem that includes predators.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:28):**  The idea of this is that basically we're testing all of our decisions, our management decisions  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:34):**  or design decisions and saying, will this increase biodiversity or will it reduce it?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:39):**  And so that means we're not doing tillage. We're keeping the soils covered. We're using  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:45):**  all of the soil health principles plus some additional ones. We have a page that we've  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:50):**  put together of principles that we're working on, working with that allow us to achieve  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:12:56):**  these goals. And one of the things in order to verify this is we're doing a lot of monitoring.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:02):**  So we're monitoring soil health, soil biology. We're monitoring insect populations, insect  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:08):**  species. We're monitoring bird populations, plant species. And obviously we're monitoring  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:15):**  things like a normal vineyard would do, like your wine quality. And so all of that has  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:22):**  led us to some interesting results. We're seeing a lot of benefits in all of those areas.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:26):**  All of those areas are good, but one of the really exciting things that happened this  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:30):**  year is we had an endangered species that's endemic to California show up. We've always  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:37):**  had a few of these birds called the tricolor blackbird. And this year we ended up having  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:42):**  a large breeding colony. We had about 800, a flock of 800 birds that were working in  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:47):**  the vineyard every day and they were nesting just below the vineyard in a small pond that  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:52):**  we have. And so that was very exciting for us. And it was also exciting for a lot of  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:13:56):**  the folks that are watching this bird and trying to figure out how do we stop the decline  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:00):**  of it. So that apparently they found the vineyard an exciting place to be. And that was a real  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:07):**  affirmation that we're on the right track.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:11):**  One of the things that I really appreciate in having worked with a number of ranchers  
**[0:14:16-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:16):**  and farmers and farmed myself is that when you do the right thing, you get unintended  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:25):**  benefits. And when you do the wrong thing, you get unintended negative consequences.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:32):**  And so we are seeing a lot of sometimes expected benefits and sometimes things that we totally  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:40):**  did not expect. For instance, the increase in bird population, we didn't expect that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:45):**  we would have an endangered species that would fall in love with the vineyard and park itself  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:49):**  here. So that was...we had hoped to increase some bird species, but that was...so that  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:54):**  was definitely an unintended benefit.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:14:58):**  The other things we're seeing is that the overhead trail, as you mentioned, does provide  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:02):**  shade and it provides shade in a large portion of the vineyard. So what we are seeing is  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:07):**  that we are creating resiliency in the face of climate change. And so the higher...being  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:14):**  higher up from the ground means we're cooler. We have a microclimate that's cooler than  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:20):**  being close to the soil. And oftentimes vineyards have been planted low specifically so they  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:24):**  could be warmer in cooler climates. So we're a warm to hot climate, so we don't need things  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:30):**  to get any warmer. And things are going towards the hot direction for us for sure. So having  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:36):**  the trellis, the canopy up high, helps provide shade, provides shade for people when you're  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:41):**  harvesting, provides shade for the animals when they're in their grazing. And it's also  
**[0:15:46-0:15:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:46):**  providing habitat for things like insect-eating birds, for spiders. And so it's expanding  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:55):**  the habitat niches for a lot of life.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:15:58):**  We are also seeing that in addition to making it cooler in the hot season, it's helping  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:03):**  to prevent frost damage when we get frost. And we used to not experience frost here to  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:09):**  the lateness that we are right now anyway. We've had frost as late as towards the end  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:14):**  of May. And those have been very damaging to the vines, the young vines that are still  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:18):**  on the ground. But those vines that are up on the trellis, we might see a little frost  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:25):**  burn but we're not getting any serious damage. So that is helping us mitigate this climate  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:31):**  change which brings both heat and cold in extremes. So that is helping us in that way.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:37):**  And so those are just a couple examples of things that we're seeing that we're not necessarily  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:43):**  seeing. We didn't, I'd kind of thought maybe that it might be helpful for frost but not  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:50):**  to the extent that we're seeing it's pretty dramatic how much benefit it is to having  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:54):**  a trellis, their vines up higher.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:16:56):**  One of the things that we have been experimenting with over the past two years is having an  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:00):**  internship program. And that has been a fascinating experience, learning experience for all of  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:07):**  us. And it's great having younger people at the vineyard who are very passionate about  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:14):**  what we're doing because we have not figured out everything yet. We have a lot to learn.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:19):**  We're just scraping the surface here. And so bringing young folks that are interested  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:24):**  in this on this journey with us and sending them out there to do what they, take what  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:31):**  they've learned from here and what they learned from other places too and expand on this is  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:37):**  I think a great opportunity of sharing or learning and learning from each other because  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:44):**  the learning definitely goes both ways. And so that has been another fun and sometimes  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:50):**  challenging aspect I'm sure for both sides that is happening here.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:17:55):**  Rebecca Burgess is an indigo farmer, author and community organizer. She's the executive  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:01):**  director of Fibershed. She set out to develop clothing made from fiber grown, woven and  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:06):**  sewn within a single bioregion, North Central California. As she began to bring ranchers,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:13):**  farmers and artisans together, she discovered that even in her immediate community, there  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:17):**  was ample raw material being grown to support a regional textile economy rooted in climate  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:23):**  change prevention and soil restoration. This is a teaser to get you ready for the farming  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:27):**  fashion mini series from the Fibershed UK team that we'll be bringing to you next month.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:34):**  What inspired me to start Fibershed was that I had already initiated a project to establish  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:42):**  a one year wardrobe challenge for myself working with fibers and dyes and community members  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:48):**  to generate something I would wear over the course of a year. And after that year, which  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:18:54):**  had been successful, there was more fiber than I knew what to do with and incredible  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:00):**  natural dye palette, incredibly talented community. I realized that there was more to this that  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:08):**  might even end up looking like a new regional economic lens to evaluate our community through  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:15):**  because most of the clothes, if not, probably close to 100% of clothing in our community  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:22):**  is imported and it has very little to no transparency. I mean, now it's getting better. Small and  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:30):**  medium brands are really pushing the edges on and even a couple of big brands are trying,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:35):**  but I felt like there was this need to codify the value system in something more structural  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:41):**  than just a personal endeavor. So that's when the community who had already participated  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:48):**  in the one year wardrobe challenge, they also started to participate in the board of directors  
**[0:19:53-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:19:53):**  and the structure to define the work came a lot from their input. They just went and  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:01):**  did all the legal work and got pro bono help and set it up as an org that would, yes, evaluate  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:07):**  the future of regional economic sovereignty, fiber sovereignty. What does it mean to be  
**[0:20:14-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:14):**  able to process our own materials in ways that allow us to provide for our communities?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:24):**  I think a global advocacy is the opportunity. I think being able to say from a series of  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:31):**  grassroots organizers who work in these food fiber, natural medicine, I mean everything,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:38):**  the land, everything that comes from and yields from healthy, productive landscapes, all of  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:44):**  us who are part and parcel of those processes, we're part of the carbon cycle and we acknowledge  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:52):**  it. What does reparative justice look like for the communities that we have forced to  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:20:59):**  become the means of production, in some cases against their will, tearing people out of  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:06):**  their traditional culture to become means of production for Western culture, which is  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:10):**  what fast fashion has done. Now that you've concentrated all those women primarily in  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:16):**  these huge sewing factories from Vietnam to Bangladesh to Myanmar, and China has pretty  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:23):**  much moved cut and sew out of their country. Ethiopia is now a new landscape for exploitation.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:31):**  What is the just transition? How do we as fiber shed organizers reach out to the communities  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:37):**  that have been so imperiled by fast fashion and say, we're taking responsibility. We've  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:43):**  always needed to, we're doing that, but we know that you got caught in a conundrum that  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:47):**  we got caught in too, but you have more to lose because this is everything to keep your  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:21:52):**  family going. I think we have to address reparative justice in this transition. It's so interesting  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:00):**  to see the achievements to me on community organizing, which is an achievement in itself  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:05):**  to be a community organizer and actually say you can call something something because you've  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:09):**  invested your time and attention into getting people to work towards something together.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:15):**  That's an achievement and that that's happening globally is awesome. There's a beauty that  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:21):**  it's also happening in primarily it's happening in Canada, the United States, Australia, Britain,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:27):**  somewhat in the North Atlantic, a little bit in Central and Southern Europe, but it's happening  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:34):**  in countries that are my, it's interesting, it's my own ancestry. My family is originally  
**[0:22:39-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:39):**  Irish, Welsh, it's Scandinavian, but the islands, the North Atlantic islands is where we're  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:51):**  from and to watch it kind of birth out of these locations, it feels, I mean, if I were  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:22:55):**  to go very personal, it feels like a healing of a very long ancestral line that we were  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:02):**  starved out, the commons were enclosed, our family had to leave, we were exiles. And so,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:09):**  and then the exiles, my ancestors, not specifically my ancestors in so much, but a lot of European  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:15):**  ancestry did atrocious things in Australia and Canada and the United States because we  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:19):**  recreated the oppression that we'd experienced in our home country. So I think what this  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:25):**  means is a full circle achievement to say, we're going to now include everyone we, that  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:31):**  was dispossessed on the continent that we colonized. And we tried to, we just almost  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:35):**  destroyed and in some cases did destroy it so much. Now it's time to repair. Now it's  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:42):**  time to apologize. Now it's time, I mean, it has been forever, but it should have never  
**[0:23:47-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:47):**  happened in the way it did, but we can really just try now our best to be humble and thoughtful.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:55):**  The thing I keep hearing about or that we would see is like, oh, it's, there's a lot  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:23:59):**  of, you know, lack of understanding of how would our future looks like because of all  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:04):**  these extreme climactic changes. But what I keep seeing is every time something catastrophic  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:10):**  happens like in my community, like a big fire, it's the sheep grazers who come out the next  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:16):**  year and start a matchmaking process between themselves and landowners to get all the fire  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:22):**  fuel load out of their communities. And I watched, I've driven, I'm going to drive there  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:27):**  tonight an entire mountain that was covered in conservation ethos, which is don't touch  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:35):**  it. And this mountain now the community was so scared it was going to burn. And so I've  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:42):**  driven out there and grazers that I work with have been working on this landscape now for  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:47):**  two years. All of the understory is healthy and low, but the tree branches don't start  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:54):**  until maybe like eight or 10 feet up. So fire can come through and smolder, but it can't  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:24:59):**  get into the catastrophic element of the tree canopy. And it was just to me to see the resilience  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:05):**  of fiber systems. It just, it's like, oh, I love it. I love that we're ameliorating  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:12):**  catastrophic fire with fiber producing animals. So that's something I haven't, yeah, we were  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:19):**  going to talk about, we're going to talk about it more, but you know, people who are like  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:22):**  my fire, a fire burned my house, I rebuilt my house, I'm still having to evacuate, but  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:28):**  my house isn't burning anymore because I have been working with this forest proactively  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:33):**  now for two years. Like people are staying and they're trying to figure this out and  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:38):**  the fiber systems are hugely integral to how they're staying. So anyway, just a little  
**[0:25:45-0:25:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed#t=0:25:45):**  anecdote of positivity.

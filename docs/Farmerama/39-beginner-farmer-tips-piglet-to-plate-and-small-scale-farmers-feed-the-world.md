**[0:00:00-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to episode 39 of Farmer Rama.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:18):**  This month we're full to the brim with small scale farming heroines.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:24):**  We start with a super inspiring farmer in New York state who shares her top 3 tips for  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:28):**  setting up a small scale farm.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:32):**  We speak to female farmers on either side of the Atlantic about life and death and what  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:36):**  it means to raise and kill animals.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:40):**  And we end the show looking at the power of photography to share the stories of small  
**[0:00:44-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:44):**  scale farmers around the world.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:52):**  We begin at Soul Fire Farm in New York state where farmer, writer and activist Leah Penniman  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:00:58):**  has spent the last 20 years building a farm and a revolution.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:03):**  Leah has just written a book, Farming While Black, which is both a manifesto and a manual.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:09):**  It includes recipes, wisdom from diasporic African farmers and practical techniques for  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:15):**  setting up a small scale farm.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:18):**  Here are Leah's top 3 tips for farmers who are just starting out.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:23):**  One really important tip, while it might not seem eminently practical, is to believe and  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:29):**  act as if the land is alive and is a sovereign being.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:34):**  One of the reasons I think things go well for us at Soul Fire Farm is because we ask  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:38):**  permission of the land to do what we do.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:40):**  And with her blessing, things fall into place.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:44):**  There's harmony.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:46):**  There's not as many pest insects or noxious plants.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:51):**  The weather seems to work out a little better for us than it does for everyone else.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:01:56):**  And while that might not be part of your belief system, I do encourage you to lean into the  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:01):**  idea of the land being a sovereign being with its own will because that will engender a  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:07):**  certain kind of respect and deference.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:10):**  For example, before we harvest the maize from the milpa, we ask for permission.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:15):**  We say a prayer of thanks.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:16):**  Before we cut down a bunch of trees, we make an offering to the tree and thank the tree  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:20):**  for their lives.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:21):**  And I think this brings about a kind of harmony in the project that is otherwise absent when  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:27):**  we only view the world as material.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:30):**  A second tip would be to really encourage young farmers to consider no and low-till  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:37):**  methods.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:38):**  One of the reasons for that is that the soil is a powerful reservoir of carbon and tillage  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:46):**  releases that carbon into the atmosphere and is an important driver of climate change.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:51):**  And we certainly don't want to contribute to damaging the atmosphere and undermining  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:02:55):**  our own life systems by pumping all this carbon into the air.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:00):**  The other reason is that when you engage low and no-till practices over time, it actually  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:05):**  is less work and you get a higher quality product.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:08):**  So whether you're using sheet mulching methods with cardboard and straw or leaves or whether  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:16):**  you use plasticulture in order to subdue the weeds over the years or occasional deep zone  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:22):**  tillage, all of these methods over time will deplete your weed seed bank and build up your  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:27):**  soil structure so you're going to get a lot more sustainable and higher quality product.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:33):**  So encouraging folks not to till.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:35):**  The third tip that I have is to integrate livestock into your whole farm system.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:41):**  For millennia, that's what our ancestors have been doing with great success.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:46):**  Animals are incredible.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:48):**  They can graze the lands in a way that deposits manure for future fertility for your crops.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:55):**  They eat pest insects.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:03:57):**  They provide a sustainable source of protein, especially in northern climates.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:02):**  And when you're using smaller livestock like chickens and other fowl or pigs, they have  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:08):**  a much smaller environmental footprint than ruminants like sheep and cows.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:14):**  And for many people, that type of protein is very important to the diet and to cultural  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:18):**  heritage and so it's been essential for us to provide some amount of meat and animal  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:24):**  products for our community, though we always encourage people to limit the overall consumption  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:31):**  of those to think about meat and animal products as a spice or a special occasion food and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:35):**  have a predominantly plant-based diet.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:44):**  If you want to hear more of Leah's story, check out the special episode we created with  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:48):**  her brought to you by Chelsea Green Publishing.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:52):**  You can find it on any podcasting platform and as always on our SoundCloud feed.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:04:57):**  It'll be released in the next week.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:03):**  As part of her commitment to sharing both Afro-Indigenous wisdom and her own learning  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:08):**  with other people of colour, Leah has created the Black Latinx Farmers Immersion Programme.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:14):**  Leah is a vegetarian, but she still keeps and kills animals on the farm.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:19):**  And this duty of stewarding life is part of what she shares with others.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:25):**  Well we do time our chicken harvest to the midpoint of our Black Latinx Farmers Immersion  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:31):**  Programme so that folks who are visiting and learning can choose to opt into that experience.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:36):**  So certainly not everyone chooses to, but this year it was between two-thirds and three-quarters  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:40):**  of people in every session who wanted to learn how to do this skill.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:44):**  For some folks it's a deeply emotional experience because they've never been so close to the  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:48):**  boundary of life and death and certainly never participated.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:52):**  We hold it in a sacred manner as possible, so we offer prayers from the Haitian Vodou  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:05:58):**  tradition, prayers from the Hebrew tradition, special herbs to help light the path to the  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:04):**  ancestors.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:05):**  We take our time and leave space for folks to do emotional processing around what's happening.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:11):**  Afterwards there's a spiritual bath, which is a tradition anytime we're near the threshold  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:17):**  of life and death to do a bath with sacred herbs and water and incantations to mark the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:22):**  end of that time period.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:24):**  But I will say also, you know, for some folks they find their calling in this.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:29):**  They really want to be livestock farmers.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:32):**  They're ready for the sacred duty that comes with stewarding life in this way.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:36):**  So we've had a few, you know, a few folks leave the program and say, you know, this  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:40):**  is the way that I want to serve my community and feed my community.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:45):**  The act of caring for and killing animals is something that's often talked around,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:51):**  but not faced head on.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:53):**  For many of us it's still taboo.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:06:56):**  So when we came across the atpiglettoplate Instagram account, we were excited to see  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:01):**  Milly Diamond sharing the day-to-day realities of her experience of rearing, killing, and  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:07):**  eating her own pigs.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:10):**  Here Milly shares a few of her thoughts and posts from this journey.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:16):**  Hi my name is Milly Diamond and I'm the founder of piglet to plate, which is a platform that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:20):**  looks to reconnect people with food and farming.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:24):**  I don't come from a farming background and spent six years in London in marketing before  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:29):**  deciding that I needed to do something different.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:32):**  Being fired probably helped with the drastic life change.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:07:35):**  I returned to North Wales where I grew up and spent 2017 raising three pigs and documenting

**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:17:46):**  sweeping pictures of farms that are hundreds of acres big, farms that are absolutely huge,

**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:02):**  that mass industrial farming is what feeds the world.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:08):**  We see that on TV, it impacts on how people think, it impacts on how people buy, it impacts  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:15):**  on how people eat.

**[0:18:23-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:23):**  it's not the mass farming that makes a difference, it's the thousands and thousands and thousands  
**[0:18:31-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:31):**  of smallholder farmers who are producing food and have the generations being producing food  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:39):**  that truly feeds the world.

**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:55):**  When you have women thrown off of land that they've worked on for generations because  
**[0:18:59-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:18:59):**  someone with money and very often your pension money is going in and buying on a mass scale  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:09):**  and actually destroying the land and destroying the work that women and men have done for  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:17):**  generations you realise how dangerous myths and false stories can become.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:25):**  What this exhibition does is to begin to change those myths.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:31):**  It begins to show people that actually it's not mass production that counts, it's people  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:38):**  who have passion for the land, people who understand and I really hope that as all of  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:19:46):**  you go away today whether you are in the private sector, whether you are in the food industry,

**[0:20:18-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:18):**  terms addresses the three big myths that large scale farming feeds the world, that chemicals  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:27):**  and GMOs feed the world and corporations feed the world.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:31):**  Large scale industrial farms don't produce food, they produce commodities.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:37):**  We used to eat 10,000 species of plants, about 10 commodities account for most cultivation  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:46):**  and 4 GMO crops account for the largest expansion.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:20:53):**  In our ancient texts it says everything is food and the more I've studied, the more I  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:00):**  realize that the ecological web of life is really a food web whether it be the soil food  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:08):**  web or it be the food web that controls pests and insects from becoming pests, you know.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:18):**  I don't think pests and weeds are part of good agriculture.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:25):**  They're a symptom of bad agriculture.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:28):**  And by monocultures, the fact that it's small farmers who feed us is because they are the  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:34):**  only source of real food.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:39):**  Not only do they produce 70% of what people eat, the reason this figure came out so recently  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:45):**  from the FAO was this measured what people eat.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:50):**  Before that what was measured, what was put on container ships and traded.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:55):**  What's put on container ships is commodities.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:21:58):**  And commodities are not just ruining the small farmer, they're ruining the land, they're  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:22:05):**  ruining the climate and they're not bringing us nourishment which food should be.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:22:11):**  The book I mentioned, Who Really Feeds the World, showed that 75% of all ecological destruction  
**[0:22:17-0:22:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/39-activist-tips-piglet-to-plate-and-marching-for-farmers#t=0:22:17):**  whether it's of soil or water, 50% of climate change, 75% destruction of most biodiversity,

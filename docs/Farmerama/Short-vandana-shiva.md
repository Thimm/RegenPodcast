**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:00):**  Vandana Shiva is a force of nature who has been described as a rockstar of the international  sustainable food movement. She has spent more than 40 years fighting for a more sustainable  agricultural system in defence and celebration of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:22):**  In episode 46 we bought you a short extract from her talk at the Farming the Future event  organised by the Roddick and A-Team foundations. But we wanted to bring you more from this  talk that blew us away. She makes a powerful case for an agro-ecological approach to farming  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:37):**  and to environmental movements, from the health benefits of healthy soil and good food, to  the social impact of modern farming and how food growing can forge strong roots for derived  democracy. She certainly has convinced me that we all need to be putting our hands to  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:00:51):**  the soil as much as we can. Her background is in physics which she studied in Punjab.  We join her talk as she describes the violence that continues in the region following the  introduction of chemical farming.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:05):**  The land where I had done my MSc Honours in Physics, which was the most prosperous part  of India Punjab, was erupting in violence. And the sacred shrine, the Golden Temple, the  army was sent and the desacralisation led to all kinds of issues. 30,000 people died  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:27):**  in that period. But it's not that it's over, because that's where the first experiment  on chemical farming in the third world was started, under the name of the Green Revolution.  And in the mid-sixties. In Punjab today the suicide rate is very high. There's a canal  
**[0:01:47-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:01:47):**  where bodies are dug up every day. Every third young man in Punjab is today a drug addict.  A problem we see everywhere in the world. Addiction in rural areas and farming families  and suicides. Indian suicides, 300,000. But it's not unique to India. Farmer suicides  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:08):**  are much higher than normal suicides in the US, in Australia, in France, in the UK, but  it's a silent issue that no one talks about. But that same year a pesticide plant leaked  in the city of Bhopal. Kicked 7,000 people. The burials were mountains of dead bodies.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:30):**  And that shook me up. And I told the United Nations University, for whom I was doing some  work on conflicts over resources, I said something's going on on conflicts here and I want to understand.  I said this conflict is a conflict between seeing the earth in non-violent ways and deploying  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:02:51):**  on the earth in the name of agriculture and increasing food production weapons of war.  Every chemical that is used in agriculture today has come out of war. Down to the nitrogen  fertilizers which were made with the same techniques that made explosives. That's why  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:10):**  they make nitrogen bombs so easily. Every pesticide, a descendant of the gases that  were used in the concentration camps. The women of Bhopal say Bhopal was made a gas  chamber. Everywhere I travel in the world where the pesticide issue is killing people,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:32):**  saying we've been turned into gas chambers, we have been killed. 200,000 people. Every  year dying just of direct poisoning. Millions more with the impact.  So I did this book called The Violence of the Green Revolution which I think Z has republished  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:03:48):**  in this country. But what I've learned since then are two simple principles which in a  way are in our ancient learning in all cultures. First, that the currency of life is food.  What moves through the web of life to nourish life? It's food and nutrition. And when we  
**[0:04:09-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:09):**  poison the food web, the highest dharma is the growing and giving of good food. And the  highest adharma is getting lazy in agriculture and serving bad food or letting people go  hungry. That's all we have to do. Turn the growing of good food into our sacred duty  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:35):**  of being alive on this beautiful earth. And that's why we all have to become farmers.  Maybe we're just a balcony. When Greece collapsed after 2008, we were there to launch the Seed  Movement and Seed Freedom Movement. And there was this young man. He said, but what can  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:04:53):**  I do? Our jobs have gone. Our pensions have gone. There's nothing. I said, you have a  balcony? Yeah. I said, grow food. He met me later, two years later. He said, I feed my  entire street. So we've been made so deeply to think that money is the currency of life.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:17):**  And money is not the currency of life. It is no currency at all. It is just a medium  of exchange. If you look at your notes, it says, I promise to pay the bearer. It's a  pure promise, nothing more. We've turned it into not just an end, we've turned it into  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:05:38):**  the measure of our humanity. We've turned it into the new God. The metric of the yield  was designed to reduce farming to the production of commodities. And all you measure in yield  per acre is the commodity that leaves the farm, not the state of the farm, not the quality  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:00):**  of the food. It's nutritionally empty, toxic commodities that are floating in huge quantity  around the world. 90% of the corn and soil going for biofuel and animal feed, not even  to feed people. And that's why the more commodities you have, the more hunger you have. Half of  
**[0:06:18-0:06:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:18):**  the hungry of the world, half of the one billion hungry are farmers. Half. So our food producers  have been turned into the hungry when they have this amazing role to play to care for  the earth. We decided for India to look at all the costs that go into the chemical agriculture  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:06:39):**  system, including the social costs of indebted farmers and farmer suicides, the environmental  costs, the soil, the death of animals, the death of bees, the disappearance of water.  So we worked out just social and ecological $1.3 trillion annually, which is bigger than  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:00):**  our GDP, the destruction. And then if you add the health damages, which we haven't done  for India, but we have a new manifesto, Food for Health, and we've got a summary of it.  So neurological neurodegenerative diseases, $2.4 trillion annual costs. Autism, $171 trillion.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:19):**  Birth defects, $22.9 trillion. Obesity, $1.2 trillion. Cancer, $2.5 trillion. Diabetes,  $2.5 trillion. Endocrine disruption, $549 billion. Infertility, $9.6 million. And antibiotic  resistance, $1 trillion. Good farming has to be defined as a health sector. It's health  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:07:44):**  provisioning. And not only is it health provisioning for human beings, it's health provisioning  for animals, for plants, and it's health provisioning for the planet. Because I see climate change  as nothing more than the metabolic disorder of the planet. All because of the huge emissions.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:06):**  And there's a focus only on emissions from energy and energy sector, but 50% emissions,  greenhouse gas emissions, come from the industrial food system. The production, the fertilizers,  the land use change, growing soybean in the Amazon, chopping down forests, transport,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:27):**  packaging, food miles, and food waste because the system designed to waste food. Add it  all up, it's 50%. And yet, if you work with the earth, we can repair the broken carbon  cycle, we can repair the broken nitrogen cycle, which is actually 300 times more deadly in  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:08:44):**  terms of emissions. Nitrous oxide is 300 times more damaging to the environment than carbon  dioxide is. We can repair these cycles and heal the soil and grow more food. And I think  this is the element that this community can bring to two movements that are very big and  
**[0:09:06-0:09:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:06):**  growing in this country. The first is Extinction Rebellion. They definitely need to see, yes,  do the rebellion, but do the solution, grow the solution. And it's in our hands. The beauty  of it, in Paris, we planted a garden and we said, governments might fail, they could have  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:28):**  failed. The governments can fail, but we cannot fail the earth. So we made a pact with the  earth and planted a garden. And Extinction Rebellion is only looking at governments and  what they can do. But this movement begins with what we can do in our communities and  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:09:47):**  our particular places, not forgetting the duty of government and not forgetting to put  pressure there, but as a derived activity of democracy, not at the heart of democracy.  And I have learned in all of these years that the place to begin sowing the seeds of earth  
**[0:10:06-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:06):**  democracy is with food, is with a living seed. There's no other place. I can set up a windmill,  but I'm just setting up a windmill. I'm not repairing a broken ecosystem. I can reduce  emissions by not having more, but I cannot pull down the stocks. Only the living earth  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:34):**  and our working with the living earth gives us the option of removing the past damage.  Soil with organic matter and in our farms and in our members' farms, organic matter  has gone up by 99%, whereas in the chemical farms in our valley, it's gone down by 14%.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:10:55):**  This is a 20-year study the top soil ecologist of India did. In nitrogen, it's gone down  22% in chemical farms. It's gone up 100% in the organic farms, but zinc, which is a big  deficiency and responsible for depression, 37% decrying in chemical farms, 14% increase  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:17):**  in organic farms. Nobody's putting zinc into the soil. The soil organisms are creating  these micronutrient centrized elements. That's why feeding the soil is our first duty. First  the soil, then the family that's growing the food, which is how we'll end hunger in agriculture.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:37):**  Then your local community, which is where the gift of food has to come back. And then  high value products, but low volume things so long distance. So trade right now has become  everything you eat has to come from far away. Lots of toxics. You don't know what you're  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:11:57):**  eating. And if you want to know what you're eating, there'll be one trade dispute to trash  you. And now with Brexit, the only US is just looking at England as the dumping ground of  all the worst food and the dismantling of the food and health and safety standards of  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:13):**  this country. It's going to be a very important time for the food and farming movement. Biodiversity  is the only way you can control pests without pesticides. The only way you can control weeds  without herbicides. And it's the only way pollinators get food because we forget the  
**[0:12:32-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:32):**  seed we sow, when it becomes a flower, is food for the bees. And the bee pollinates,  fertilizes the flower, which becomes the fruit. Look at the economy. That's the economies  we have to build. Where the bee gets honey and the flower gets fertility and neither  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:12:54):**  became less. Because this Cartesian way of thinking mechanically is, if you have more,  I have less. Which has also created the illusion of cheap. First, that there has to be cheap  food to feed the hungry. That food is not cheap. If you take all those costs to the  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:12):**  planet, to the farmers, to our health into account, it's too costly for us to continue  to produce. And that's why internalizing these externalities becomes a very important part  of it. So it's not cheap. And I think while we address the ecological apartheid which  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:33):**  has separated us from the earth, we need to address the nutritional apartheid, as that  has brought a crazy situation. Where if food is the currency of our life, and the tiniest  of bees, and the tiniest of babies should be having good food, we have created an assumption  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:13:52):**  that the poor can be deprived. That being poor can pull you out of the cycle of life  where food is the nourishment. So, and the two apartheids go together, the two separations  go together. The only way we'll be able to bring the right of all to good food is through  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:16):**  the right of all people to grow good food. I've reached the stage where I say the most  important thing the earth is asking us to do is put our hands, our heads, and our hearts  to her service. And that's agriculture. So we need these hands. And the reason I think  
**[0:14:36-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:36):**  Colin, like me, questions so much the mechanical mindset, the old paradigm of thinking, which  grew with the fossil fuel age and with industrial agriculture being one element of it, is the  idea that human hands are useless. And if they're not useless, they must be made to  
**[0:14:58-0:15:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:14:58):**  look terribly dangerous. All food safety is hands touched it. Yeah? I mean, in India we  have big things of women's food systems. Women cook with hand. You know, we say handmade  is our new subversive label. Bring the hands back. And that's why the only way to reduce  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:24):**  fossil carbon is to increase living carbon and increase the human capacity to work. We've  forgotten, you know, the definition of energy is the capacity to work. That the ultimate  energy we have is our capacity to work. And especially when you think of the fact that  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:15:47):**  with artificial intelligence people like Zuckerberg are talking about 99% human beings being useless.  I think we need to do two things. First is unleash all the intelligences, all the intelligences  of the amazing planet, all her living systems. Won't you just share with you this one simple  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:09):**  thing? I mean, the neurological activity going on in our gut with food is much bigger than  the neurological activity going on in this brain up here. That's why it's called the  second brain now. The gut is being called the second brain. But in the root of the plant,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:16:29):**  in one plant, one plant, 13 million rootlets, all combined with the root hairs, 6,000 miles.  One plant. Each little rootlet is functioning with exchange. It has a cerebral cortex with  larger root systems, brain neurons, 14 billion. One plant has as much activity going on. And  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:02):**  we define them as vegetables and said they are dead. And I think the big revolution for  food and farming, I mean, J.C. Bose, our physicist, had done amazing work on plants as living  systems. I think the intelligence of plants, the intelligence of soil organisms, the intelligence  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:18):**  of the earth as a whole, the intelligence of animals, including this animal, which has  lost its animal intelligence in the seeking of permission of mechanical intelligence.  And now we're being told, for real, you throw away people. So we need a whole new hope for  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:36):**  young people by getting rid of the Iraqis of work, that farming is the past, software  is the future, and the next future is disposability. No. Farming is the highest vocation. Cultivating  food is the highest thing you can do. And Gandhi had a very beautiful, when people said,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:17:55):**  how do you think small changes can make a difference? He said, I'm not saying we'll  stay small, but we'll spread out. Not scale up, but scale out. And the way he described  it is ever expanding, never ascending, oceanic circles, of which each of us is a part. But  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:16):**  each of us is a center. Each seed is a center of the farming system. But nothing is oppressing  it as a pyramid. Each of them is spreading life in collaboration, in amazing cooperation  with an inner intelligence. The last idea that's coming to me is, you know, all of living  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:36):**  systems are based on self-organization. It's being called autopoiesis, organizing from  within. Free societies are organized from within. Gandhi talked about self-rule. All  controlled systems are organized externally. Earlier it was chemicals as external inputs,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:18:55):**  but now it's knowledge will be external input, data will be external input. You'll have to  borrow more and more and more. You have to live in perpetual debt to stay alive. If you  look at the debt craving, someone gave the figure in one of our groups, two pounds for  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:13):**  the children, one pound goes for water, and one pound for food. How could we come to this  situation in what was the heart of the big empire? So we talked about decolonizing England.  And we have a wonderful, you know, we have a beautiful link and we should talk about  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:32):**  this. Albert Howard, who was sent to India in 1905, he was brought to industrialize India's  farming. He brought back organic farming to this country. We've got to do a little bit  more of that. Over all of these years, to learn from the earth, to learn from nature,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:19:48):**  to learn from our farmers and our peasants, to learn how to cultivate community both as  earth community, but as human communities because we've lost the capacity. Fossil fuels  just ruptured our relationship. We built an earth university. And I think one thing we  
**[0:20:03-0:20:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:03):**  could serve and be happy to serve is if you want young farmers trained for a quick transition.  And you know, instead of thinking of how many farmers are going out, let us make a 10 year  plan. And in the 10 year plan is poison free food and farming, fossil fuel free systems.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:27):**  A 10 year plan of get the public money out of subsidizing the wrong thing into supporting  the right thing because right action doesn't need subsidy, it needs support. And finally,  educating young farmers, growing young farmers and our university is always there for that  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-vandana-shiva#t=0:20:45):**  service. Thank you.  This episode was edited by me, Suzy McCarthy, for Farmer Armour. Thanks for listening.

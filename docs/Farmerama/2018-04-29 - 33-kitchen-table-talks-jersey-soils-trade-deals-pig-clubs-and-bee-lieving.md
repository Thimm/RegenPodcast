**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:00:34):**  There's an update from Northern Ireland as we hear about pig clubs.

**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:00:57):**  The idea is to create a wide-ranging piece of legislation that touches on several aspects  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:02):**  of Scotland's relationship with food, from production to distribution to education and  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:07):**  food culture.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:08):**  Nourish is a food NGO and a founding member of the Scottish Food Coalition.

**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:21):**  The idea is that friends, neighbours or colleagues get together and talk about the past, present  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:27):**  and possible future of food in Scotland.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:30):**  Then they feed back their top fives, their concerns about food in Scotland and the government  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:35):**  actions they'd like to see.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:37):**  So I had some friends over for a talk.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:40):**  Here are just a few snippets.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:41):**  We started by sharing some of our childhood memories of food.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:45):**  Just eating sweets.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:46):**  Just loads of sweets.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:47):**  It's amazing what a big part of my life as well it was.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:53):**  My life revolved around it in a sense.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:54):**  You'd get your pocket money and that would be, well I can buy this sweet.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:01:58):**  When new sweets came out it was really exciting in the playground.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:01):**  It would be a shame to take that away from them in some sense.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:05):**  Obviously we want better nutrition and better health.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:08):**  Having grown up in socialist Poland we actually didn't have any sweets.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:14):**  So my parents had a garden.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:16):**  We would be eating fruits from the tree until the Tommy burst.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:22):**  Sometimes my parents couldn't cook, they just brought stuff from canteen and that also wasn't  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:27):**  very unhealthy or anything.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:29):**  It wasn't hardly ever fried.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:31):**  So thinking about it actually my diet was better.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:34):**  I had way better food growing up in 80s in Poland than I have in 2018 in Scotland.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:43):**  By far, by far.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:44):**  When I was growing up what we ate was very limited in some ways and it was usually very  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:50):**  seasonal, even though I grew up in a council estate, everyone had a garden.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:56):**  All the gardens were open.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:02:57):**  We used to kind of sneak into the garden across and steal the strawberries.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:02):**  But we used to grow things like potatoes, carrots, rhubarb, but I didn't eat a pepper  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:12):**  until I was an adult.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:13):**  I personally wouldn't mind going back to those times and certainly you might have to give  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:18):**  up certain foods but I would be fine with that.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:22):**  When I was growing up in Dunbar a lot of my time I was like I guess I'll get a fish cake  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:27):**  and a roll because that's what I can afford to eat right now.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:30):**  And that's what you eat.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:31):**  And it's crap.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:32):**  You're growing up and it's not good for your mental health and ethical concerns is not  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:37):**  a concern.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:38):**  No, no, going to Greggs and having a fried product.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:42):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:43):**  Or something carby and heavy and hot and that's what you want.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:47):**  These are all good concerns but also if you're going to talk on a national policy level for  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:52):**  Scotland keep the gunpowder dry maybe.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:03:57):**  I think that is very relevant and I think it is obviously important to remind ourselves  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:00):**  that a lot of what we're talking about is just so far removed from most people's concerns  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:08):**  and most people's context when it comes to food.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:12):**  And I guess my question would be how can we create a situation in which living affordably  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:22):**  does not mean eating badly and the double burden as Bella from Nourish pointed out of  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:30):**  living in poverty and not being able to afford food that is actually going to nourish you  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:35):**  and having to then deal with the health consequences and rely on a national health service that  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:40):**  is underfunded.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:41):**  So how do we get away from that?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:43):**  A big part of that is cooking.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:46):**  I haven't done the maths but I don't think it is that expensive if you are buying the  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:51):**  fruit and vegetables and cooking from scratch.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:04:54):**  But if you want to go out and eat then it tends to be the unhealthy stuff that's cheaper.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:00):**  But it does I guess take a bit more effort.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:03):**  I think we're in a really privileged situation where we've had the time, the resources to  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:09):**  learn how to do that as well.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:11):**  A lot of people I think will be like I've got bigger things to think about than sit  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:15):**  down and learn how to cook and stuff where I can survive if I do this quickly and get  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:19):**  on and I've got other things to do.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:21):**  I think it's changing the culture around food of learning and encouraging cooking and encouraging  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:29):**  it and showing the benefits of that through education.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:32):**  Showing them this is how much money you can save and getting that in.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:35):**  When people are young, I don't know, we do home-eck in school but all we made was baked  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:40):**  apples and a big scone.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:42):**  But even simple things like imagine this big soup that we can make and who can make it  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:48):**  the most locally or the cheapest way and who can bring in something new to it and that's  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:54):**  a really nice thing you could do as a class.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:05:56):**  I think in parts of Japan the way food is served at school is that the students have  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:02):**  a rota and they serve it.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:04):**  So it's students serving students and it's freshly cooked and they talk about what they're  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:11):**  eating that day as part of the curriculum, as part of their class and they go through  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:15):**  the menu.

**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:24):**  I was thinking as well about how do you educate people or whatever to know how to cook stuff  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:30):**  well.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:31):**  I think I don't want to be told how to live and the notion of somebody educating me about

**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:42):**  I don't want to go and be told how to live.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:44):**  I think the only way that I learn about food and eating is by people cooking for me.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:51):**  That's so true though.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:52):**  If you're cooking with someone or you go to somebody's house for dinner and it's comfortable  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:06:57):**  and you're part of it, that's the prime time for learning about food and how to eat it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:02):**  But I guess given that what we're talking about here is what can the government do,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:08):**  I think what you were saying about actually bringing that sort of experience into school  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:14):**  is a really important point and that can maybe be one of our top five.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:18):**  We talk about healthy nutritious food needing to be available at very low prices so that

**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:34):**  not making what would be classed as the right sort of health choices.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:37):**  So a big part of it is economic but I think the cultural shift is really important.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:42):**  Related to the question of cultural shift which seems so huge, there are so many institutions,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:49):**  schools, hospitals, even the museums around here, anything that is government run, the  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:56):**  food tends to be shit.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:07:58):**  That's a big one.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:00):**  Probably because they're trying to sell it at the cheapest and it's best value judged  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:04):**  in very, very narrow terms.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:08):**  That can be a really huge positive influence if institutions that are government, state  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:14):**  funded, it's our money ultimately, if they're state funded or if they receive any kind of  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:19):**  funding from the state that actually it's not just about the bottom line and about cost  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:24):**  but actually it's where does this food come from, is it nutritious, is it produced ethically,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:30):**  etc.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:31):**  For people in hospitals.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:33):**  I agree but it's like how do they monitor that, how do they measure that?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:36):**  There needs to be an established system of measuring ethical nurse or local nurse or  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:42):**  value or health given properties or impacts on the NHS.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:48):**  Maybe needs to be a standardised system of measuring that so that there could be some  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:52):**  sort of rating.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:53):**  And then if there was some sort of rating then it could be applied wider than just public  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:08:59):**  bodies if other people wanted to use that then they'd have, well this is what good food  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:04):**  looks like.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:05):**  On a budget for an organisation.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:07):**  Although it's also defining Jo what you just mentioned which is what do we define as good,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:13):**  I think especially in Scotland or maybe especially in the UK, it's a loaded question because  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:19):**  you start, because of class.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:22):**  And why, why, why, discuss.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:25):**  I don't know if there are reasons sometimes where I have not chosen the healthy thing  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:32):**  slash maybe the thing that I actually want.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:34):**  What you choose to eat is like a symbolic thing, it's like an identity thing.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:39):**  People would judge you if you start thinking that you're above yourself or whatever.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:43):**  This is why it's such an interesting cultural question and you have to be really delicate  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:47):**  about it and probably do it in schools with kids in a non-patronising, very careful way.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:09:53):**  To throw it slightly more open, for me part of the problem is that food is a commodity  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:00):**  and food is something that is traded and invested in.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:03):**  I think land ownership might have something to, like most of the land in Scotland is owned  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:09):**  by very few people and it's very expensive, land is very expensive.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:15):**  That whole system of land ownership reform needs to maybe be looked at to help other  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:23):**  more smaller businesses get into farming maybe and just to support farmers who are trying  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:29):**  to do the right thing.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:32):**  And I think off the back of that, thinking more about longevity and resilience, and that's  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:38):**  why more kind of conducive conditions for things like community supported agriculture  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:45):**  or models where maybe you have more people on the land and maybe the profit margin isn't  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:51):**  as great but you know that this is a model that is actually going to survive for the  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:10:57):**  next 5, 10, 20, 30, however many years.

**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:08):**  to food as fundamental.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:10):**  Yeah, and right, I mean that's something nourish are really keen to push, is the right to food.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:16):**  Which I hadn't really thought about in those terms before was how bizarre it is that we  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:20):**  accept that there should be a universal right to education and there should be a universal

**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:34):**  It's brilliant to hear people with different experiences come together and discuss what  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:39):**  they want for the future of food in Scotland.

**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:11:53):**  This is what we kept coming back to.

**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:13:37):**  We spoke to young farmer Justin Legraeli at Anvil Farm about their first attempt to produce  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:13:42):**  potatoes and vegetables with zero external inputs and importantly how they're using  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:13:48):**  microscopes and compost extracts to guide bacterial and fungal populations.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:13:57):**  My name is Justin Legraeli, I'm from Jersey.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:00):**  We're based on the east side of the island at Anvil Farm.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:06):**  We've been running at Anvil Farm since about 1958 and I guess now ultimately we're market  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:12):**  gardeners but we have exported to the UK, a little bit to Europe but now what we'd really  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:20):**  like to do is basically focus on getting the best possible produce out to those that live  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:27):**  on the island.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:28):**  I studied architecture and so obviously was away from the island, moved back to Jersey  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:33):**  and a lot had changed on our family farm.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:36):**  It was just my dad and my mum and staffing becomes to be quite a big issue on the island  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:43):**  and so we were sort of looking at how we could reduce our inputs but also how we could be  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:50):**  more efficient and effective with our time by sort of working with nature rather than  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:56):**  against it.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:14:57):**  We'd been doing a lot for export, for supermarkets and so the ground to be honest with you is  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:02):**  quite tired.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:04):**  You know Jersey Royals are early season so the soil was sort of working for us from February  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:11):**  to well sometimes all the way through because we'd be doing broccoli and stuff with very  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:16):**  little rest.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:17):**  So it definitely needed some rejuvenation which is when I think we got in touch with  
**[0:15:23-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:23):**  Promessa Soils and Glyn Mitchell and I started doing some other bits of research as well,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:31):**  looking to the states for inspiration, looking at cover crops and that sort of thing and  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:37):**  it's still early days for us I'll be honest but yeah it's been a fun journey so far.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:43):**  So we built a really large new tunnel and we thought you know what that'd be a perfect  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:49):**  place to trial sort of compost teas, compost extracts, keeping living roots in the soil,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:15:56):**  mulching, no till that sort of thing so this new tunnel site we called Glyn up and we basically  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:06):**  did a huge trial for us anyway in that space and then sort of looked at what happened so  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:14):**  obviously we started that season with Jersey Royals, no chemical input whatsoever not even  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:20):**  fertiliser just planted vetch alongside the Royals to get a bit of nitrogen in there just  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:26):**  before that we'd actually put some compost extract to sort of boost microbe numbers and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:33):**  to get the soil sort of working for us.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:37):**  Had a perfectly normal harvest from it without any input so great, fantastic and then we  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:44):**  sort of moved on to our normal sort of summer crops so really mixed variety of salads and  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:51):**  pak choi and spring onion and all sorts of stuff just to see what happened and yeah some  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:16:57):**  interesting results you know walking up to the pak choi and finding it wasn't shredded,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:02):**  turning over lettuce leaves and seeing some dead bugs like green fly and stuff after a  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:07):**  folio feed of compost tea you know the whole thing being that if your plants are fit and  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:14):**  healthy like us if we're fit and healthy we can repel viruses and things that's sort of  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:21):**  how the theory goes yeah it's sort of just continued from there.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:26):**  We make thermo composts so I have to hold that compost between 55 and 65 degrees I think  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:33):**  for 15 days but within that you can change sort of the characteristics and the properties  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:40):**  of the compost by putting different things in whether you have a higher ratio of green  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:47):**  or brown material to make it either bacterial or fungal but then equally you know I'm always  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:52):**  on the hunt for mushrooms to try and boost the levels of fungi or looking for bits of  
**[0:17:57-0:18:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:17:57):**  moss ultimately the more diversity the better because we're trying to just improve our soil  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:05):**  and build it back to what it was and what it should be.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:08):**  I don't understand this fully yet but you know the majority of our fields are quite  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:15):**  bacterial which for things like brassicas is not a bad thing brassicas don't do particularly  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:22):**  well in a fungal dominated soil apparently but ultimately a 50-50 fungi to bacteria is  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:30):**  ideal for growing the majority of veg.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:34):**  I've just finished the microscope course and it basically allows us to look at the microbes  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:39):**  that we have in our soil it will also let you look at the microbes that you might be

**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:49):**  your current soil state you can analyze your composts you can analyze your compost extracts  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:18:55):**  and compost teas and then obviously you can analyze it all after a dose of compost extract.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:03):**  Obviously it's not a standalone the whole compost tea thing you know so we're looking  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:09):**  at really diverse cover crops sort of 10 or more and using into cropping or even using  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:16):**  cover crops amongst crops that we're selling and I think the thing for us as well is actually  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:22):**  how do you work the compost tea into your agricultural system.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:26):**  We're all different scales we all have different equipment I welded rods on the back onto the  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:31):**  back of our subsoiler so that we can put the microbes underground that works for us might  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:36):**  not for someone else other people have more capital and they can go and buy something  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:40):**  that fits much better you can get it to work for you but it can be a really beneficial  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:46):**  add-on to the system that you already have.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:49):**  We're really going going home with it you know we have our own compost tea brewer and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:54):**  so we're just going to put it out as much as we can across the whole of our farm we're  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:19:59):**  in sort of a I guess an unusual situation for Jersey in that we only farm our own land  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:20:06):**  which is about 48 acres but should be considered quite small but when it's only me and my dad  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:20:13):**  and my mum it's quite a lot to do and so we're just yeah we're just going to slowly implement  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:20:19):**  that across the whole of our farm and just keep sort of monitoring how how things change.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/33-kitchen-table-talks-jersey-soils-trade-deals-pig-clubs-and-bee-lieving#t=0:20:24):**  If you can make your own sort of fertility on site and you can have things that are going

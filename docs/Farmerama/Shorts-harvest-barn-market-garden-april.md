**[0:00:00-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, this is Joel at Harvest Barn Farm Shop Market Garden. It's April the 28th. That is  
**[0:00:16-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:16):**  the sound of rain falling on the polytunnel. A couple of weeks ago we got the plastic on  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:23):**  and finished off all the ventilation on the sides and the doors. So the polytunnel is  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:29):**  now fully functioning which is amazing. And over the weekend I was building a couple of  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:36):**  benches and I'm now starting to sow seeds which is a massive step forward to be able  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:43):**  to be in the dry in the polytunnel and finally sowing seeds on site in trays. I have brought  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:50):**  some from my flat in Norwich in the back of the car which was a bit of a nerve-wracking  
**[0:00:57-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:00:57):**  experience because I had a fully laden car, had to load up the car with all my other stuff  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:04):**  and about 500 seedlings and drive down to London to see my dad. I almost had an accident  
**[0:01:11-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:11):**  because a lorry cut up a car in front of me and I had to brake suddenly and half the seedlings  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:19):**  did a somersault in the back of the car. But luckily they were all okay. I was most worried  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:24):**  about some lettuce seeds that I'm trialling with the Gaia Foundation but they were okay.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:31):**  And then I had to unload them and load them up again and come up to Peterborough and they  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:36):**  have all made it safely here so I'm waiting for a bit of a dry gap to plant them out.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:41):**  That may not happen so I may have to get muddy and wet again. But it's great to be inside  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:47):**  the polytunnel and sowing seeds. I can finally sow my tomatoes and peppers and various other  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:53):**  things. It does feel very, very late to be doing that. I would have liked to be doing  
**[0:01:58-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:01:58):**  it in January or February so I'm two or three months behind but let's see what happens.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:06):**  The polytunnel is covered now with cardboard on the ground because I was going to make  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:13):**  beds out of compost bought in from a green waste compost supplier. I'm just testing that  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:21):**  soil to make sure that there's no chemicals in there from grass clippings which might  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:27):**  affect the plants that I'm going to be sowing. So I'm just waiting to see how those plants  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:32):**  fare in that soil. If it's okay then I probably will bring in the compost. If it's not then  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:38):**  I will just plant into the ground. I have covered the ground with cardboard to make  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:44):**  sure the grass doesn't grow back but I have also rotovated all the ground in the polytunnel  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:49):**  so the soil is looking okay for planting into but there is quite a lot of grass root in  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:02:56):**  there so I would prefer to plant into weed free compost. So I'm going to carry on with  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:03:02):**  some seed sowing. It's quite nice to be in here with the sound of the rain on the plastic  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:03:08):**  and to be staying dry and relatively warm. The temperature has gone down to about eight  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:03:11):**  degrees again so after that very hot period of a few days last week the temperature has  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:03:19):**  dropped again so it's fluctuating quite a lot this spring. We'll see what the summer  
**[0:03:26-0:03:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-april#t=0:03:26):**  brings.
